| 0:05:53| So this doesn't change anything. It just means people serve for four more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=360)|

| 0:06:10| if a postponing doesn't change anything about the day-to-day operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| Okay. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=376)|

| 0:08:17| in order to protect the public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Seeing no objection, I'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| So speaking of the governor's orders, I want to just start off by thanking council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| business owners, and residents for staying vigilant as we continue to navigate COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| A year ago this month, I declared a state of emergency in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been a stressful and intense year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| And as Dr. Buchanan warned, it's been a marathon, not a sprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| But tonight, a year later, our case numbers are heading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| The number of people getting vaccinated is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| I think we have almost a quarter of Knox County residents who have at least one dose of vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| And of course, many of those are among our most vulnerable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| So that's really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I see the light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| So at the same time, we don't want to stumble right before we're crossing the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| As some of us associated with Knox County schools may have gone on spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| other temptations as we get to warmer weather and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| I just want to encourage everybody to not stumble before we cross the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Maintain precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And if you've been traveling, don't let your guard down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| If you've been vaccinated, it's still important to keep practicing the five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| But we are in the homestretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| I'm really encouraged and hope you are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| So I also want to thank Council for holding last week's workshop on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| It's a challenging topic and one that many people in our community are tackling from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| different angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| One of the most important ways we can address homelessness is by preventing it in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=596)|
| 0:09:56| So I want to remind everyone that there is significant housing assistance dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| available for those struggling because of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| In particular, the Knox Housing Assistance Program, which is a joint program of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| and county, has $14 million coming from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| This $14 million will offer a huge opportunity to residents who owe back payments or who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| may be struggling to afford housing due to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Our Housing and Neighborhood Development staff has been working with Knox County Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Development staff and service providers to launch this program and get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| There will be more information to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| And please help us by encouraging people to call 211 if you or anyone you know needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Call 211 if you need help with your rent or housing payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| Calling 211 is just a good idea for all kinds of help for social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| But that's an important way to get the word out to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| I also hope that you all can get the word out about the next of many community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| about the Knoxville Sports and Entertainment Park proposal, aka the stadium, the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| So City Council, as you know, has had several opportunities to discuss this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| And this meeting is designed to give another opportunity for residents and community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| to learn about the proposal and get their questions answered directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| The event will take place this Thursday, March 25th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| on community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| To submit a question, please email them to KnoxvilleStadium at KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| And finally, I hope to see many of you and many residents as well on Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| at the virtual 2021 Neighborhood Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| The Neighborhood Conference is one of my favorite city events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And I want to commend Debbie Sharp and everyone in the Office of Neighborhood Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| for pivoting and finding a way for this to go on safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| While advanced registration is closed, you can register the day of this Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| by going to NeighborhoodConference.live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=715)|

| 0:12:06| and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| So take the time to register this weekend and then watch at your own pace throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=731)|
| 0:12:11| And that is it for my report to Council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So are there reports from any Council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| Okay, seeing none, we'll move right along to item 9a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=743)|

| 0:13:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| I believe Amy Brooks is on the phone, is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| I just wanted to ask, I've had a lot of questions about what this enables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| what kind of changes this will enable, and kind of how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you for the question, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| So to my knowledge, discussions regarding the appropriateness of adding the social service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| center began probably with the former director, Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| But last summer, early fall, there were several requests that came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| from a planning commissioner and from Council Member Singh yourself, as well as Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Roberto, asking planning to take a closer look at whether or not social service centers should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| have been included in additional zones, and specifically in the D, K, E, which already has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| already includes uses that are compatible, such as the homeless shelter and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| So staff evaluated the appropriateness of expanding where social service centers would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I think we are charged at looking at all zones, and not specifically just the D, K, E, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| And so currently, the use is allowed in the institutional district, as well as the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| commercial zoning districts, as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| And so this would expand where social service centers are allowed to more closely align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| with these compatible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| It does, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And it also, with some of the questions that I received, this also shows that RECODE is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=928)|

| 0:15:37| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Council Member Kinsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=940)|

| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| The name is Patricia Berrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| I live at 807 Phillips Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| I sent a couple emails today with regards to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| I would ask to postpone this project at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| There are a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| When our neighborhood met with some of the city people and stuff, there's no clear definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1300)|
| 0:21:51| of exactly what's going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| There are too many ifs in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| It seems like a simple project, but what this project is going to lead into is something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| and I don't know if anyone has walked down Langford and actually seen how much infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| is going to have to occur and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| I don't think Council realizes the intensity of the need to work that the city will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| truly paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| I think that this money could be used by other neighborhoods that have begged and needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| things done in their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| This is going to involve pavement, sidewalks, curves, parking, which will not end up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| We know because of what's occurred in Island Home neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| This is going to essentially be work that's going to be done for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| So we, as a neighborhood, have major concerns with what, and the city, they have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1372)|
| 0:23:03| able to show us really what is going to occur on the south side of Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| I'm concerned about where the center line is now showing versus where it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| All this stuff, I mean, is in flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| It's not actually set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| I know that other people are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| It impacts us more so than anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| I had actually thought of being as the amount of right-of-way that is on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| of Langford being as it's only approximately five feet, maybe four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| It's actually, I mean, we have banks that drop all the way down to the road where our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| sewage systems come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And so the right-of-way for the south side is not really of any use to anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| There are all trees that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| We have our sewage lines that connect in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| So it's not really, I mean, the only use for this, other than one pole that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| end up being removed that is not needed per KUV or AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| So I'm trying to gather my sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| We have the varying center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| That is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| There's uncertainty in this whole project, the way we've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| We've not had ironclad information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| I do know that on the south waterfront, this is being revisited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| but we've not heard anything on the revisiting of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| But it's supposed to be in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| And now we hear that there's no curbs that we had talked about, you know, as in the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| of the south waterfront, there's a curve that goes along the south edge of Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| And now we hear, well, there's not going to be a curve, at least not right now, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| means we're going to be going through all sorts of torn up roads for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| The right of way for the private property that's going north, which Dominion owns right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1529)|
| 0:25:39| is rather deep into the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| So you guys would also be paying for more or less the sidewalks that go to the entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| actually, of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| And I don't think the taxpayers should be paying that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| I'm just trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I've got 25 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Anyways, this isn't going to be used for public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| This is basically for private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And all the residents along Langford are extremely concerned about what's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| happen on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| And so ask that it at least be postponed so that there can be real investigation into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you, Ms. Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| The motion's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Council Member Smith, your hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Yes, I was going to ask Deputy Welch to address some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| particularly raised by Ms. Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| I'm very familiar with the property and I've talked about this with a number of neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| understand some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| I want to make sure that we address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Just as a reminder for Council and others that this is selecting a vendor to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| a part of the public infrastructure associated with the capital expenditure that we approved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And the primary goal, as I understand or I know, is to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| This public infrastructure will be used to connect Sevier Avenue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Sutry Landing and make sure that there's sufficient parking and sidewalks, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| and that utilities are taken care of, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So, we postponed this a couple weeks ago for a lot of the reasons that Ms. Barrier just raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| and they're valid concerns, particularly as it relates to the south side of Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| If you're not familiar with it, Langford runs parallel to the Tennessee River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| and there's residents existing on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and there's open lots that are privately owned on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| So, Ms. Barrier's concerns around the south side of the property are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Deputy Welch, could you talk a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| under the primary uses, the street width, the potential curb, or any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| impact to trees, etc., on private property on the south side of Langford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you so much, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And I think you summarized sort of the background very well in that this agreement is really part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| of a long-envisioned and public plan that was to complete the street grid pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| providing connection between Sevier and Sutry Landing, and to make sure there's good connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| also from the west to the east and east to west in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| So, to speak to the specific concerns, so if you think about the south side of Langford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| is the side of Langford that would be closest to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| That is also the side that's adjacent to what is currently, it's private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1744)|
| 0:29:12| but it is, it's currently undeveloped private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| So, the north side of, I'm sorry, I said that wrong, that's the north side of Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| The south side of Langford is basically adjacent to the backyards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| residents who live on Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| And so, over the course of, as we've looked at this, not just over the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| but prior to that, concerns from the community around disturbing what basically is a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| that has right-of-way that people have been taking care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| It's in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| It is city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| We have figured out a way to minimize impact to those backyards by making sure to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| the trees by, and I think Ms. Barrier alluded to this, to install a curb, which is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| called for in the form-based code, as she indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Installing that curb would really impact, even though it would be in the city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| it would impact the backyards of people who live along Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| It would have the potential of disturbing trees along the backyards of people who live on Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| And it was, you know, after much community engagement, there was great concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| disturbing those backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And one way to do that would be to not disrupt the south edge of pavement that is adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| city right-of-way, which is adjacent to the backyards of people who live along Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| So, we're making every effort to not disturb those backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| I hope that answers your question, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1867)|
| 0:31:07| And I do think, I do appreciate the engineering department for listening well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| And Rebecca Jane has done a good job during the process as well as answering the neighborhood's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| But just so that I'm clear, there's no expansion of the road south in this phase toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| properties, residential properties, and there's no curve, there's no impact other than, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| a telephone pole being added in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| So, as far as the, you are correct, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| So, the street as it exists right now on the south side, the actual edge of the pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| and that pavement is not going to change as it interfaces with the city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| which is also, you know, for most of us, we understand, I mean, city right-of-way is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| sometimes, you know, it's people mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| They take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| It's their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| And so, it was important, even though that is city right-of-way, because that is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| part of what people, you know, use as their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| We did not want to disturb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| So, the pavement interfacing with their backyards will not be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| And I think another important part of this will be public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I think the popularity, even by some of the folks in the community, the popularity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| Sutry Landing has been way underestimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| It's a great space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1965)|
| 0:32:45| And so, I think, so much so that we implemented, not everybody's aware, we implemented a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| parking permit pilot earlier this year, thinking ahead to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| So, I do think public parking is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| Now, there definitely need to be mitigation steps to make sure that private residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| don't utilize those any more than is allowed to, but public parking is extremely needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| in that district, particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| So, well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Are there any other issues that Ms. Barrier brought up that we didn't cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| I didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I was just taking notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| So, I don't have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I plan to support this, but I do think it's really important that we listen to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| in advance of these items coming before council, and I appreciate the neighborhood walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| the property alongside the department, the administration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| So, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Council Member Parker, and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| It does seem like the neighborhood is asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Is there any concern with granting a postponement, another postponement, so that, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| during COVID, when we have limited ways of communicating, it may take more time for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| members to fully engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| And also, this is an area, you know, we were aware during the budgeting process initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| that this was an area with a lot of money in the budget for a lot of projects, and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| members spoke out during the budgeting process of their concern with so many projects happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| in their community at one time and projects that they didn't necessarily see as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| So, it seems like, you know, to make sure that we are listening to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| another postponement would be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| I don't know if Director Harold-Cannon or Ms. Justice, I know that this has been an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2097)|
| 0:35:06| issue that has been discussed for years, if not longer, long before the pandemic hit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| So, I'm not sure what the, you know, what the downsides to postponement are, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| that I'm not sure it will change anybody's minds, including, you know, the benefits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| going forward and creating this grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Director Cannon, could you speak to Councilmember Parker's questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Harold-Cannon, Director of Engineering, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| I've had to do some history research because much of this was approved prior to my coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| The original intent of the city was to improve all the infrastructure along this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| between Langford and Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| Unfortunately, as we have all experienced, COVID kicked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| There had to be some budget trimming, and it was agreed, given that none of us really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| knew what was going to be happening with COVID, to reduce the overall scope of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Total budget was $1 million, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| If we'd done it as a whole, it would have been $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| The proposed improvements are consistent with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| There has been some discussion related to that Langford was intended to be an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| or service road in a vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I cannot speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I can speak to the form-based code, which was adopted after any vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And if you go to 7.1.5M, it specifically shows the improvements for Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| Deputy Mayor Welch is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| I shared this personally when I was in the field with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Our intent has been to minimize the impacts on the south side of this roadway, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| with respect to what the edge of pavement is for these residents, they're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| to see any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| In fact, there will not be a pavement overlay on Langford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| What we are doing is saw cutting where the parallel parking spaces will go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Those will be constructed along with curb, as well as sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| And then only that section is going to be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| That will allow us to do the same thing on the south side, if you will, of waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| And we will be completing both Empire and Full, as well as what's been referred to in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| the past as D Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| We've shared about all we know to share and have answered the questions as much as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| We did show them where a theoretical curve would go, painted out in the grass area on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| the right-of-way, and said at that time in our first meeting, we said, we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| you want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| We don't believe you want this curve right now because of what it will take to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And this can go in at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| And at any time, Council chooses to move forward with it and fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| But all of the improvements are, at least on Langford, are along the north edge of pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| and solely for the creation of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| And I think we have done, I'm proud of our staff, because as I said, this predates me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| although I have had some involvement lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I'm very proud of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And R.J., in particular, leading the charge of listening to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| And I think we've done our best to answer their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| I do not see any benefit in postponing this action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you, Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Deputy Welch, did you want to speak to Ms. Parker's questions about the process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| we've engaged with the neighborhood state or any other things to answer her questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| No, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2351)|
| 0:39:11| Unless there was something that wasn't answered, I think Mr. Cannon covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2357)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Ms. Parker, I was going to go to Mr. Thomas, and then if you had follow-up questions, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| can come back after, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Or did you want to, did you have anything else for Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| No, I'm struggling to understand the reason even behind the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| It seems like perhaps it's for Setre Landing Park and it's not for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| But I don't have a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| I'm just trying to understand the project at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| I wouldn't be able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Council Member Thomas, you had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| I suppose for Engineer Mr. Cannon, the packet speaks of connectivity between Sevier Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2397)|
| 0:40:08| and further down, I guess, to Setre Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Could you kind of explain to me kind of what that would encompass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| For example, would it be a sidewalk straight down Baxter Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| Or I guess I'm trying to get a picture of the connectivity improvements that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| made between Sevier Avenue and further toward the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Council Member Thomas, I probably won't do the best job of answering your question, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| if I could kind of keep the plane at 5,000 feet for just a minute, the connectivity elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2436)|
| 0:40:46| for the south waterfront are exactly what the form-based code outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| And through that, there are a number of different sections for different roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| throughout that neighborhood and that community with the intent of being to enhance the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| by having that connectivity to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| And to our new park, Setre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| It calls specifically for, if you will, east-west connectivity, as well as enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| the north-south connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| In another phase of this project, there will be roads constructed within city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| but where, frankly, there are no improvements right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Again, following what was approved as the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| I wish I could give you specifics in different areas of the south waterfront, but it varies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| from roadway to roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| But it was a very intentional plan to have vehicular, pedestrian, and frankly, bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2513)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Mr. Council, I just want to just reiterate that one of my key priorities for my administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| is healthy and connected neighborhoods, and this project is very much consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| that priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| And I'm really proud that it's on here, and I think the neighborhood's been given some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2527)|
| 0:42:16| input and it has shaped and we've responded to it and changed the nature of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| to better meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| But that park is also something that serves the immediate neighborhood and other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| and connects to bus routes and neighborhoods not just in south Knoxville, but to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| and across the other side of the river as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Yeah, so I just wanted to summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| So this project creates the curbs and on-street parking on city right-of-way that abuts not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2564)|
| 0:42:55| the backyards of the neighbors that exist, but of the property that's closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2582)|
| 0:43:02| Is that correct, Ms. Welch or Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| So it creates additional parking that is available to myself or anyone else that would go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| to go to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| That is correct, Council Member Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Versus they would not be parking up on Phillips or other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| Well, and they are not able to park up on Phillips right now, Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| because there's a residential parking permit program that is being piloted on Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| And there have been, sorry, my dogs have decided this is exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| There have been concerts at the park, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Not during recent times, but prior to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| And I did not attend, but I'm assuming that parking flowed up many other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Okay, so this parking helps alleviate and, you know, address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Does it have the propensity to be included in a permit situation if demand warrants it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| We always have that ability to have, you know, that's something that we can certainly discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| We are looking at other parking options in the South Waterfront area, including looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| at potential real estate for both temporary and permanent parking in the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2675)|
| 0:44:35| But you are correct in that the on-street parking that's being added through this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| is, it will be public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Oh, did you, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I was going to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| That's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Just to clarify that all of the public infrastructure is, that impacts the roadway or grass areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| near this are on the north side of Langford, which is away from the current residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| So I applaud the engineering staff for listening well, because there were other options, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Does anyone know what it looked like when there was overflow parking from the concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| or, I know on the weekends, it's very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Where are people parking right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| I think I predated Council Member Smith even on some of this, I was serving on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| but I'm sure that he experienced it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| People parked everywhere, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| I think just as it's not infrequent in many parts of our city, when there's a city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2753)|
| 0:46:03| parts of our city, when there's a special event, parking is at a premium and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| become creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| And unfortunately, it was becoming very problematic for residents along Phillips who use on-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| parking themselves for their own use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| So that's why we started the residential parking permit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I'll just say that I happened to ride my bike to a concert there and the bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| and felt very accessible for those of us who are close enough to bike and have a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| So anyhow, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=2798)|

| 0:55:10| This is something that's a best practices for most transit agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| When you look at buying new tires as opposed to leasing tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| it's much more expensive to buy new tires because we have to have steer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| which are new tires in the front of the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| And if we did, we bought new tires for all the buses on all the tires on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| which would be six, it'd be very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Now, one of the other options you can look at is retrending tires or retreading tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| That's very, very labor intensive for a maintenance department because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| you're not going to get as many miles on those tires as you would a brand new tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| So it's very, very labor intensive and increases your labor costs and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| So when we look at the cost analysis, which we have to do every year we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| leasing tires as opposed to buying brand new ones or purchasing retrended tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| it's very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3365)|

| 1:01:44| Quote, in small meetings, the chair should speak generally on the same basis as others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3704)|

| 1:02:29| accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I would also politely request that council members please call the chair out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| when she rebutts citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Another minor note, section 7.5-70 rule 9 of the city code states any proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3757)|

| 1:02:48| The chief of police introduced the recently revised schedule for fees for open records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| requests which sparked much debate on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3772)|

| 1:03:04| I requested video for two incidences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| The first was a peaceful, socially distanced car caravan protest where we awarded Robert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3787)|

| 1:03:18| The caravan was followed by three unmarked police cars which I believe had two officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| If I counted correctly, that would make six officers for seven protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| The second request was for the videos of the arrest of a homeless person I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| the arrest was based on a false report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Under the new fee schedule, which we were assured would reduce costs, the total fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| for video recordings of these two incidences was quoted to cost between $200 and $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you for your time, and I yield back my remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3827)|

| 1:04:23| team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3863)|

| 1:04:35| Our mission is to implement an alternative response team in Knoxville to improve outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| for people in crisis and reduce demand for police involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| We are putting in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| We've held many focus groups where we've spoken directly to folks in Knoxville who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| are most affected by policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| We have a broad range of community members that include activists, mental health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3890)|

| 1:05:00| And one of my favorite parts, we've been lucky enough to have meetings with groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| who do this work across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3903)|

| 1:05:28| It is a disservice to our community to expand the co-response model by giving KPD more power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| and resources without exploring other evidence-based models that are more effective and save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| It looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| KPD claims they're being innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| But the reality is that people with mental illnesses are still being treated like dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| criminals, and in some instances, going to jail after they refuse compulsory treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3946)|

| 1:05:55| Since we haven't received any responses, I'll spend some time today going over these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| main points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Each of these statistics has a source citation, and I'll be sure to share again so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3960)|

| 1:06:07| What is an alternative response team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| An alternative response team pairs a behavioral health specialist and a medic who are dispatched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| by 911 for nonviolent calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Alternative response teams respond to a wide range of mental health-related crises, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| conflict resolution, wellness checks, substance use, suicidal ideation, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| An alternative response team is an evidence-based model to improve outcomes for those in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3987)|

| 1:06:35| And boy, does Knoxville need to repair trust with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Why do we need an alternative response team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Studies show that crisis intervention training has no significant effect on reducing arrests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| use of force, or injury rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Police presence can escalate crises, and victims of police violence experience increased mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| health symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4014)|

| 1:07:03| Why is this the best solution for Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| The Hoots, an alternative response team in Eugene, Oregon, saves an estimated $8.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4025)|

| 1:07:17| In 2019, CAHOOTS requested police backup only 150 times out of 24,000 calls, showing how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| crisis workers can successfully and safely respond to a broad range of nonviolent calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4044)|

| 1:07:38| persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| An alternative response team could handle many of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| This would improve outcomes for people in crisis and save taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Reimagining public safety is more than a buzzy catchphrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Reimagining public safety means examining our systems of oppression, talking to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| community, and serving Knoxville in ways that affirm and recognize each individual's humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210323?start=4076)|
