| 0:04:59| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| We are now at the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| And storm last week was incredibly disruptive to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| Our public safety and public service employees have been doing a terrific job working tirelessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| in dealing with the challenge, responding to emergencies and clearing debris and directing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Our public service department has been actively clearing roads and removing debris since approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| 8 p.m. Tuesday night when the first round of storms hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Due to the volume of storm debris, the public service department is suspending its normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| two-week brush collection schedule and will focus solely on cleanup and removal of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| and limbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| We very much appreciate the efforts of KUB in dealing with this unprecedented challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Their communication has been exemplary, and I understand that Council Member Palmer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| also address this during reports from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| Also let me mention the Jazz on the Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| It resumes tonight at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| This has been a very successful event that has drawn quite a few people to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| I want to thank Judith Foltz and the special event staff for creating this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| My understanding is that it will continue for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| Reports of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I, as Council Members know, represent the Council as a liaison with the KU Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| We all have committee assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| And so during the storm, I've had, as we all have, frequent updates about what is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| At 4 o'clock today, there were 129 customers who did not have power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| And basically, those customers are individual cases where when you bring one on, then somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| else will be the next in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| KUB has a full commitment of crews out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Last Tuesday night, 127,000 customers were without power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And then we thought we were doing really well, I guess, from KUB's standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Then Friday morning, I was up all morning watching the tornado come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| So kind of like we took three steps forward and about 18 backwards, but they're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Typically, if there are several customers on a line, the job takes four to eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| A single customer job can take 15 minutes to eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| And if a pole has to be replaced, as there were quite a few, that takes six to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| hours to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Customers are also out in some adjacent counties to Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| When the tornado came through Friday morning in the West Haven area, which is in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| district, the tornado warning was in effect and a KUB crew was working in the Sanderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| They had to take shelter in the cab of their bucket truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| There weren't any trees in the area where the truck was parked, but a pine tree landed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| in the bucket of the truck when the winds had stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| So when it was safe for them to get out of the truck and look, there was a pine tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| in the bucket of the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| So a little humor, but not so humorous either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Also, on Sanderson Road, a number of houses had trees leaning inside the house and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| been forced to vacate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| After the tornado touched down, crews had to cut their way out of the West Haven area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and they were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Then the creek began to rise and that caused more trees to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| So that area has particularly been hard hit and it's my understanding that power is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| much restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| However, if you're one of those 124, you're not finding this so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| In the Gresham Middle School area, there was a three-phase line that took 12 hours to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| restore service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| When that came back online, 50 people had power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| Others did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| So I think this gives you a good idea that these things are not quick fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| I had calls, as I'm sure other council members did too, but I'm just not into going in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| bucket truck to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| But I have an enormous amount of respect for people who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| The call center at KUB got over 210,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| That's typically what they get in a three-month period, so they did handle a large number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| 120 poles, 111 transformers, and thousands of fuses and splices have been used and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| continue to get deliveries every day to go back and do permanent fixes in some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| that had some temporary fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| One of the things that this council asked or came about because of this council was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| the formation of the KUB tree trim panel that met for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| There were a number of recommendations that KUB has adopted as a result of that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| One of them was an automated call service to let people know that tomorrow KUB is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| to be on your street to trim your trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Well, they used that service to let people know the status and the update of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| A lot of KUB customers have cell phones, and so they were able to reach many people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| did not have a landline service, as was my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| A couple of other things, KUB sent four media advisories out daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I personally appreciate keeping council informed so that as we talked to constituents, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| informed about what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| KUB has asked me to thank the customers for their encouraging words, patience, and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| during the restoration efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| The employers and contractors were continually encouraged by the support of the customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| KUB also wants to thank the mayor and city council for their support and for assisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| KUB by passing along concerns and thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| In that regard, I had hoped tonight to have some linemen dispatchers, some people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| the city here to personally thank for their work, but they're still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| I passed several trucks on my way in with debris they picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| So what I'd like to do with council's indulgence is ask that in two weeks that we have representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| linemen dispatcher and some people from the public service department come who have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| been in the field so that we can personally give them our thanks and the city's thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| In two weeks, we'll give everybody time to be cool and collected and no more storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| And illuminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you, Councilwoman Palmer, for those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| The first pension task force will meet July the 12th at 4 o'clock in the small assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| So if you'd like to attend, it's in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Also, we've made some progress on the ridgetop hillside slope protection joint committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| and working on a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I have contacted Steve Joyner with Lipscomb University at the suggestion of the joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| And he is honored and willing to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| He has reduced his rate in order to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| I've talked to Cornerstone, Lawrence Tullock, and they are going to underwrite the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| So I should have some dates in the next couple of days for you to look at, for council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| And I am in contact with Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| And we've been communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| So here very soon we should have our first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor, for the work you're doing on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I'd just like to echo what Ms. Palmer had to say in regard to thanks to KUV and to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| And also would like to ask if we could just have a quick update on Charlotte Davis, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| was here this last time, and find out what the city has done with her request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| If Becky Wade could, David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| David may be able to answer more specifically about what CODES has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| I do know that the property is scheduled to go to the Better Building Board in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Yes, David Brace, City Public Service, 2150 Maplewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| I was actually out of town, I know, when she came to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Our folks, both David Massey with Community Development and Robert Moyers with Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| CODES, have met with her, along with Ms. Baker, who had called with similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| Bob Davis, the inspector for that zone, went up and inspected those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| There was actually access into the buildings, so we could determine that there was continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| decline in those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| We do have it slated for the July Better Building Board, and we're going to meet internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| We really want to make sure it's slated for a tax sale, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| So we want to make sure that we have options with the tax sale, we also have the Better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| We want to make sure we make a good decision long term for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| So myself and Becky and Dave Massey talked late last week and need to get together this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| week and really just talk about a strategy, because there's a number of properties up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| But I think we've addressed her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| They've been an issue for a number of months, if not years, and we need some resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| on it for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| And then one other item, Mr. Mayor, if Bob Wetzel could just give us an update on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| extension of Gay Street, the work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=886)|
| 0:14:56| Bob Wetzel, Director of Redevelopment, appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Our Gay Street project moves forward, the 300 block project is going along real well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I noticed driving in tonight, they have the final forms ready for maybe doing our final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| pour down there tomorrow or before this week's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| So everything except the landscaping and the repaving will be done here in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| few, well, within the next week on the 300 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| And then we're going to wait until this fall to put the landscaping in, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| And then on the 600 block, up at Emory Place, the water line, they hope to have that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| all in this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| The electrical is, they've got the streetlight part working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| They've got a lot of it that's, the part that's going underground will be going underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| and he says he'll get started on that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| So hopefully we'll have the utilities done in about two to three weeks up on that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| and then we'll move into the final, you know, the concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| And once again, the landscaping and the street resurfacing will occur at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| But we're making good progress on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Ms. Mitchum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| 11.0 is a resolution celebrating, honoring, and congratulating the Sequoia Branch Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=963)|
| 0:16:13| upon the occasion of its 50th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| And moved and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| And so Audit, is there someone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I was going to recognize Jan Miller, if you would stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Ms. Miller serves as the branch manager at the Sequoia Branch Library and with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| help in researching this resolution, we learned that not only is the Sequoia Branch celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| 50 years of service in the community, but it was preceded by a decade by a place called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| the Sequoia Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| And the city library system provided books and the Sequoia Hills Presbyterian Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| provided space for the patrons to come check out books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| So a long and storied history in that neighborhood and certainly provides a lot of service both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| to seniors and to children as a gathering place and a safe place in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| So we thank you for coming out tonight, Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Did you want to come down and greet the council or make any statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| First of all, I'd like to thank the council for recognizing the success of the Sequoia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| Branch and to let you know how much we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| We do have 50 years of service under our belts now and hope to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We're currently averaging about 35 patron visits, 35,000 patron visits per year, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1057)|

| 0:22:16| I might again suggest that we put some kind of safety valve in Section 11-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| This is probably going nowhere, but Subsection C requires a bond under Section 11-2, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| we heard last time that that was a fairly onerous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| I think you might want to have a safety valve that says something to the effect of, unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| otherwise exempted, the requirement of the bond, unless otherwise exempted by the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| of police or, excuse me, the fire marshal or the chief of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| In other words, there may be occasions where they want to do this, and I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| they have authority to waive it the way this reads to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| It says that they must file the bond, and I think we ought to put discretion in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| fire department if there's a circumstance where they might want to waive it, so we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| put a little tail on the sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| In Section 11-5-C, the second sentence reads, prior to the issuance of a permit, an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| must file a bond in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| We could put a second comma and say, unless exempted by order of the fire marshal or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| chief of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| I don't know how folks feel about that, but it would give him some discretion if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| was a minor usage permit that did not require probably a fairly difficult bond to get issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| So, I suggest that we'll leave it to my council members to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Mr. Swanson, did you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| Any time you put discretion to an official or any time you award discretion to an official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| with regard to something like this, you run the risk that it is unenforceable with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1440)|
| 0:24:08| to the requirement because then comes the issue of under what conditions do you not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| require it and under what conditions do you require it, and that's a court battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| And a lot of times, you end up with your ordinance being deprived of that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| So, I could not recommend it to you, but I would defer to the law director if she feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Ms. Poplin, did you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I agree with Mr. Swanson's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Are you making a motion, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| No, I was spitballing and throwing it on the floor to see where we went with it, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| ain't going very far, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| I guess it troubles me because I know that we're going to have citizens that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1493)|

| 0:26:29| Could you tell us just a tad about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| The house that was there was damaged by fire and the previous owners donated the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| to the city with the agreement that the city would demolish it and then put the vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1599)|

| 0:29:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I had discussions today with both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Martin, and it's a matter for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| record if they could give us a little explanation on what the situation was and why this cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| And whether or not there are other alternatives, as was spelled out in your one email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| First of all, I'd like to say nobody likes surprises, and I really wish that we had known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| about this issue prior to the construction commencing, but we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Staff did do some research, but apparently we didn't turn over every stone to find there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| had been a basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| The interesting thing about this issue, though, is that regardless of when we found this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| issue, this sidewalk had to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| It was structurally in such poor condition that sooner or later it had to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| That in turn makes it very hard to repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| When concrete is rotten or very deteriorated, it's hard to repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| So we looked at at least four different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| For example, on one of the options, we thought it would be simple enough, as some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| all have suggested, just to take two big steel plates, bolt through the concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| and hold this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Well, the concrete was so deteriorated that that wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| The deterioration of the concrete in conjunction with the way the building structure and substructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| is constructed made it almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| There's a huge load on this particular sidewalk, and I don't know how to describe it other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| than engineering terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| We call it a cantilevered slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| It means that you have a wall here, and then the sidewalk projects out, and the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| has to be strong enough to take on all the load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Well, because of that, if we cut this sidewalk without some temporary shoring, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| to rotate and could possibly make the wall sag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We all know that the wall of the Milders Building is a nice building, and we don't want anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| to happen to that, so we're very conscientious of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Therefore, we've got to have lots of temporary shoring in order to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| We did look at four alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| One of the newer technologies that the manufacturer thought was going to work, at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| when we sent him the plans, he just bailed out and said, my product will not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| It has taken us some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| It's taken some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| It is primarily a result of just the way this structure is constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| In a downtown area, most things are 100 or better years old, and you do not find conventional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| We did not have conventional construction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| For example, the way they tried to determine if there was a basement or not on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| end was look at the Gay Street plans back from 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| That was one of the projects we were working on when I first came to work in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Those plans did not show this basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| In addition to that, if you look at the top of the sidewalk, it has manhole lids in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| which would lead you to believe that there's a manhole underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Well, unfortunately, those lids are just sealed off, and there's nothing underneath except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| a big void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| We did not find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| We would be paying for this sidewalk replacement sooner or later, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| I will acknowledge that had we known about it on the front end, we probably could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| gotten a better price during the bid process, and that's what I'm really disappointed about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and hate to come to you with this change order at this time, but the sidewalk does have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| It will not last forever in its current condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| As we talked this afternoon in terms of the price that we have here, is it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| just to put back what you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Did you bring a drawing of what it's actually going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| I left it in my office, Councilman Grieve, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Basically, the reason that we can't just patch it as it is is because it is too deteriorated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| for any type of patch to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| We have to replace this sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| There's no other way that it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| It will be just a standard structural sidewalk with some brick pavers in it, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| I'm the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I'm all about the function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| If you need some aesthetic advice or have some concerns about what it may look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| I'm sure Dr. Lyons there could help us with that, but I apologize that I didn't bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| I do have those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| I would gladly share them with anybody at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Maybe, Dr. Lyons, could you kind of explain what's happening here with the sidewalk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| the aesthetics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Sure, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| The sidewalk was redesigned largely because it was extremely narrow and deteriorated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| all the way from Gay Street into Market Square, and the purpose of this project, among others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| was not only to improve the looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| I think the aesthetics were important, but always secondary with a couple of rows of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| bricks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| The importance was to widen the path between Gay Street and Market Square because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| gotten a phenomenal amount of use, and also the sidewalk was in bad shape anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| What you have now going down from Market Square in front of the coffee and chocolate and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| retail area there is what it will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| It will just be extended to Gay Street with that additional width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| So we think it will fit in with the other sidewalk repairs we're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| I will second appreciate what Brent said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| You know, as it turns out, we didn't know it, but it was rotting anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| You hate to say it's not just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| We wish it wouldn't have happened, but on the other hand, had it not been noted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| fallen in, you know, it could have been a much worse situation later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| And also, I might add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| The region's bank is moving into that space in the Millers Building from across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and of course, they're doing a lot of work on the building, and they'll have new entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| that weren't there before, so there will be even a lot more pedestrian use on that, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| is all a good thing, but, you know, it has led to some concerns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Well, that brings up two other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| One has to do, Dr. Lyons, you've already addressed the fact that region's bank is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| I have been getting telephone calls in terms of when you think, with what is now going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| to be done, when will they be able to access that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| That was one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| I'll go ahead and have you answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Well, I don't know that I have a date for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I can tell you they currently have two ways to access their project, from Gay Street and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| then from inside the Millers Building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Our construction engineer has met with the region's construction manager as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| our construction contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| They've all come to an agreement, and I've not heard any complaints since they met and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| worked out this process in which they're going to complete that construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Yeah, but we will have some kind of a date to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Again, just assuming we get this change order approved and can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Okay, and then the other question, it's a concern that I have, and I'm sure it's a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| that KUV has in terms of the building, is how close to the marble base will you be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| cutting the concrete in terms of, so that we don't chip or damage or crack the marble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| Our typical construction, downtown type construction, we're going to have to do the same thing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Cumberland Avenue if that project moves forward, is we basically use the width of a concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| saw and we just go along the building without touching the building, cut the sidewalk just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| that distance, it's usually six to eight inches, away from the wall, and then do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| demolition from that point toward the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| One other thing, now since you've given me the floor again, I did want to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| we have looked at ground penetrating radar as another mechanism of not letting this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| We've got a pilot program going, and we hope to use that later on to avoid this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| The other thing, excuse me, that I'd like to say is that I really appreciate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| that engineering has been very candid about what the situation is and why the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| occurred as well as Mr. Martin and Dr. Lyons, and so I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| They've been very open in terms of answering all the questions, and I for one appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Councilman Dellavopia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Yeah, I think we have covered the basic ground, and I'm not going to belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| The reason this is important to council is in large part because the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| is significant, $241,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| My question slash suggestion, Brent, is there some way that we can either include in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| change order an incentive for the contractor to, as he's working on the problem and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| of uncovering it in more detail, to do it cheaper in a sense of less expensive, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| less effective, and give him an incentive with some kind of bonus if he does that rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| than spend the $240,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| The other thought is could we make the change order, a change order up to the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| $241,000 so that if it can be done cheaper, we haven't thrown too much money at the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| As far as addressing your first question, this is a very specific design, and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| wouldn't want him to cut corners, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| It's a very specific design, and it's a very heavily loaded structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| It's got a building sitting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| We want the building to stay standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| We absolutely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| And as far as the second item goes, we only pay contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| That's part of our philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| We do not pay them a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| We pay them unit items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| So if he uses less concrete for some reason, he don't get paid for the full amount of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| He gets paid by the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| This is an estimate of what it's going to take, but if he uses less, then he will get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| reimbursed less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| We have unit contracts, and that's been the policy of the city for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Mentor and Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| to assist the city in increasing the amount of business it conducts with minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| businesses for an amount not to exceed $60,820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I was just going to recuse myself because I work with Mr. Mentor on a board, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| it would be inappropriate for me to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| We'll continue with our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| And I see that Mr. Mentor is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I don't know if he wants to address it or not, but all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Mr. Mentor, did you need to address it in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| If not, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Yes, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Following the vote, I guess I would just like to thank Mr. Evans for following up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| We had a very robust workshop on this issue and talked about the city's desire to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| our minority contracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And this is one of the things that we asked Mr. Evans to do, to bring in some contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2446)|

| 0:42:41| Well, I think that, Council Member Della Volpe, there are two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| One, we have an increase in payroll, which is one of the criteria that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| The other is that it's based on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| It's a percentage of the payroll itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| It's based on claims experience as well, and we've had, unfortunately, an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| in our claims experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Our broker does a good job marketing this and really working with the various insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| So we feel, while this is an increase, and obviously we'd rather not have, given those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| two factors, we think this is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=2598)|

| 0:50:50| Yn Ã´l.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| The ayes have it and so ordered and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| 11-k is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a 10 year sub-lease at the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| of $1 per year between Legacy Park Foundation and the City of Knoxville for property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| at the lower section of Fort Dickerson Park off of Blount Avenue to be used to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| parking for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I'd like to have Joe Walsh come down and perhaps just speak briefly to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| what this enables us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| Joe Walsh, Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| What this agreement will allow us to do is to build a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| at the lower end of Fort Dickerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| and many of you attended last year's Legacy Parks Mayor's Luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| and got an opportunity to see the lower portion of Fort Dickerson down by the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| One of the issues all along has been we had this part of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| but it wasn't very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| But now because of the work with the Public Service Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| working with us in Legacy Parks, we've been able to build a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| and now we're looking to create a parking lot which will allow people to park there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| and right now walk into the park and be able to take advantage of that portion of Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| The owner of the property, his name is Dennis Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| He's a resident there in South Knoxville, and he's been working with Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| Basically, he's donating this parcel to Legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| who in turn is going to sublease the parking lot to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| so we can work with Public Service once again to build a parking lot for park users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| It's just more enhancement to making Fort Dickerson part of South Knoxville being a destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| and that's a huge part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| So I invite everybody to certainly take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I know we've got money in our budget starting July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| to do an enhancement project for that portion of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| because this particular park is one of my favorites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| This is a jewel right there within one mile of downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and if you haven't been out to the quarry, I strongly encourage you to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| and get a chance to visit this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Yes, it's a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| 11L is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| to support the East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition's application for a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| for up to $250,000 in funding for the development of a long-term plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| to accommodate electric vehicle infrastructure in the greater Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| and if such application is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary to accept a subgrant of $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| from the East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Yes, I wonder if Mr. Lyons could tell us if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| this is an excellent program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| but what happens if we don't get the 2100 units or something in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| the electric vehicles in place by 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| What happens to either the Knoxville program or the grant or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| Are those hinged together or just a target?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| What are we doing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I'm going to turn that over to Susanna Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| who's been handling this, our Energy and Sustainability Coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Susanna Sutherland, city of Knoxville, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| You were asking what happens if the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| charging infrastructure doesn't get in place by 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Yes, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| that was one of the reasons we were moving forward with this grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| or at least helping the folks work with the grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| was to try to meet that target of getting more electric vehicles in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| and so this is trying to put charge stations and whatnot in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Could you tell us what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| A little bit of background about that goal and what happens if we don't meet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Well, essentially there's two parts to this project in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| The first has been federally funded from Department of Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| to the tune of millions across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| Tennessee is a test state for this market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| so Ecotality is a private contractor to DOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| whose responsibility is to put charging stations in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Chattanooga's area, Memphis, and Nashville by 2012, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| by the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| So beyond that grant, at the end of that grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| the city actually accepts the infrastructure to own, operate, and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| So what we're looking at with Clean Fuels Coalition with this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| is what happens after there is no Ecotality and we own the charging stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| So it's kind of a more comprehensive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| outside of this initial Department of Energy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| This is the front end to try to make available the charging stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| so the sales of vehicles will occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| and more energy conservation will occur related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| This grant is actually the second part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| The front end is happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| So we're hoping that when folks see the electric vehicle infrastructure available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| then that sort of range anxiety that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| if you purchase an electric vehicle, where do I charge it, goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| But beyond that, no more comprehensive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| to what happens after that initial flush of federal funding is gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| is what this grant is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| All right, we'll have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| on behalf of the city of Knoxville necessary to acquire Enfi Simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| a property located at 3113 Morris Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| owned by Johnny Denise Hicks Carneal, now Johnny Dagnon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| for $55,000 for the Lorraine Street Public Works Complex project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to file a grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture Forestry Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| to provide funding for the purchase of installation of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| in an amount not to exceed $20,000, with the city match up to $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| and authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| to accept such a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Yes, I guess Brent Johnson is here, unless I've got David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| This is, of course, a great program to try to get more trees in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and I think we're all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Do you have any effort looking at follow-up watering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| It's really heartbreaking to see new trees go in and you get to July and August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and watch them dry up and burn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| and you kind of wish there was a water truck somewhere coming by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| keeping them healthy during that stressful period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| until they really get established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| David Brace, City Public Service, 2150 Maplewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| We have a watering crew, a full-time watering crew, during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| So they do attempt to â they have a route where they run our new trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| to make sure they get water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| We've had about a 10% mortality rate for our initially planted trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| which has been pretty good, or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| So we do monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Those trees have a warranty, and our arborist, Jeff McCarter, keeps up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| But we will â if you're aware of trees that are stressed and need water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| definitely shoot me an email and I'll get it to Mr. McCarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| We do occasionally get some requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I know Mr. Hill from the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| there's about 80 trees down on the waterfront that we just didn't have on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| We now have it on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| But just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| This grant is a really good opportunity to leverage our existing planting dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| We've had this â we've successfully been awarded this grant, I think, the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| So it's allowed us to add $20,000 to our $40,000 planning budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I think I inquired one time in the past, and I was told that if they make it a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| we stop watering, we don't care if it's stressful or not kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| and we figure they're on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| And I didn't know if we had â you know, if we sort of looked outside and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| the weather's been bad for three weeks, let's get a truck out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| I don't know if we've followed up with avoiding more mortality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| No, I mean, I think, you know, we plant an average of 300 trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| so 300, 600, 900, 1200, it starts to become challenging to maintain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| You know, the rule of thumb is for every inch of caliper, it's one year of maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| one year of watering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| We had larger caliper trees, two- and three-inch caliper trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Those require two to three years of watering maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| So that's your guideline for â| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Yeah, I mean, that's the standard, and we've been following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| We've been buying inch to inch-and-a-half caliper trees to minimize the long-term maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| You know, what will be interesting is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| we're going to have kind of the crossroads of these storms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| where we've lost a lot of trees and the completion of our tree inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| That's going to be a great time to look at what are we doing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| where do we need to improve, where do we have lack of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| And so that's going to be a really good opportunity for the city and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| I hope we can get a workshop maybe in August or September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| where we can sit down with Davey Tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| You know, one of the major issues we have right now is pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| We do a really poor job of pruning trees the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| We don't have a pruning schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Some cities have a pruning schedule for five years to really build that shape on our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| So watering is important, catching disease is important, and then obviously pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| But those are all valid points that I think we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| And you're working on that with the tree inventory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Yeah, the tree inventory is essentially done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| They're completing the report, and they'll be done mid-July, the end of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| and then I'd like to get, assuming the administration is supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| I'd like to get, I'd love to have a workshop where the tree board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| and the inventory folks from Davey and myself sit down and just talk about trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| what are we doing well, where do we have issues, how can we have a better program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| We've got a pretty good program, but we can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| 12A is an ordinance amending Section 4-103 of Chapter 4 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| so as to remove the specific restrictions regarding advertising signage for alcoholic beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| and provide that advertising signage for alcoholic beverages comply with applicable requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| set forth in the city of Knoxville zoning regulations as well as the requirements of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| 12B is an ordinance amending Chapter 2, Article 7, Division 2, Section 2-721 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| to add a new subsection authorizing transfer of title of certain property to the Knoxville Utilities Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and ratifying any such transfer occurring after November 25, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 1, to direct that persons authorized to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| as non-residents qualified to vote by reason of ownership of property located within the corporate limits of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| cast such ballots by mail as absentee ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| I'll make the motion to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| And I'd like to have Mr. Rogers come down and perhaps not only explain this to the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| but to the audience at large that this is, you know, I think this is an important measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Votes are coming up and it's important to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Clifford A. Rogers, Administrator of Elections 300 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I appreciate Councilmember Pavlis expediting this matter on your all's docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| This measure, for the record, affects only 249 voters, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| So we have a very, very small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And I think it's important, too, so everybody understands we throw this term around property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| I'm not sure if everybody understands precisely what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| And this is a short definition, but it's important I read it so we don't have any misunderstanding about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| These are non-residents of the city of Knoxville who have owned a fee interest in a parcel of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| at least 4,000 square feet in size within the city of Knoxville for at least six months prior to the date of the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3798)|
| 1:03:27| and who own said property on the day of election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| and who are otherwise lawfully registered and qualified to vote under the general laws of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| shall be eligible to vote in all municipal elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Not more than two non-resident voters shall be allowed to vote upon such parcel of real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| So that's the definition that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| The reason we've been in a little bit of a rush to get this before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| obviously this has just been recently enacted in law to be effective July the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| allowing you all to decide, each city council, to decide whether they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| I can tell you that the Tennessee Association of County Election Officials, my predecessor, Greg McKay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3848)|
| 1:04:18| and I strongly support this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| And getting back to the election that's probably coming up, we've got the city election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| but we also may be having at the same time a special election for Senate District 6 seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3866)|
| 1:04:35| If that were to happen, there are some voters in Knox County, being property qualified voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| who will vote in that election in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| And then they will have to get in their car and drive to wherever their piece of property is in the city and vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| So that is inconvenient to the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And it also presents a little bit of an administrative headache for the election folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| because we've got to be sure when we give the ballot to that person who's only going to be voting in the city at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| that we don't give them a ballot, say, to also vote again in that special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Now, I know all of that is, I'm just going to give that example to you because we don't know for a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| that those two elections are going to be at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| But I wanted to bring into focus that election just to give you all a realistic example of how that could play into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| And absentee voters, this is easy for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| They don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| They're going to mail the absentee application for ballot to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| They fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| They send it back to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| And we mail the ballot to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| So it's a real simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| And they don't have to drive around to where their property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| So, with that said, are there any questions from any of the members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| And that will, I mean, that is their mode of voting, will be that ballot that you will mail them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| Yes, I want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| This doesn't allow them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| It requires them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| And is there any cost savings, I mean, attached to it or nominal at most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| Yes, it would be nominal from a cost perspective, Council Member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| but the cost of having somebody erroneously vote in an election that they're not supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| it's hard to put a cost on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Obviously, if there were a close election and we had somebody that had participated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| then we would have some serious consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| So that's why everybody has been for it that's an election official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| because it just cleans up something over here that could be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| It seems like to me, I mean, to me it would be a real savings to the folks that actually work the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| I mean, it seems to me that would be extremely confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| It is just another area that's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Most of you all know I've only been on this job two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and I don't think that I've ever worked as hard and studied as hard to learn one little narrow area of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| I come from a very broad background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| It is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| It is convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| It is disjointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| It is important for us to train our workers in any issue that I can get off of their plate that they don't have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| on election day is something I strongly support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| So I can't emphasize that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| This is not exactly related to this, but in a way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| We have a new voter ID law that is on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Will that impact this election, this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Could you enlighten us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| I will be delighted to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| I think this is a perfect forum and a perfect time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| and I think it's absolutely imperative that each member here understand where we are at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| But this photo ID bill, unlike so many of the legislation that has been passed, which will be effective Friday, July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| the photo ID bill is not effective until January 1st of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| So I know how folks in East Tennessee are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| We like to get worried about things way in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| We don't want to worry about today's problems or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| We're going to look way on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| This is a problem for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| But for this election coming up, whether it be the city or the special election for the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| it's going to be just like it always has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| People will not have to have a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| And I know there's a lot of questions about what we are going to require next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| but we're in the process of getting direction from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| They're going to give us materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| They're going to give us guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| And we're going to really work hard trying to educate the voters as to what's going to be required of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| and give them ample time to meet the requirements of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Mr. Rogers, I really applaud you on your effort thus far, and I know you're being very conscientious about your work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| You said that there are approximately 250 some odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Yes, 249 are what our records reflect right now, Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| How are you going to go about educating and informing these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| Because you said earlier to me on the phone that this is going to take off the plate of the workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| those people that come to the wrong precinct to vote, a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| They don't know where to send them, and it's chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| On the other hand, when these first 250-whatever voters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| they just ignored their mail or they didn't, you know, how do you try to correct that problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Well, I don't know if I can correct the problem of they're ignoring their mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| That one's I'm not going to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| But what I will tell you is that on this first go-around, if everything falls into place like we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| and it gets passed on the second reading, that we know who those voters are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| and we are going to mail that application for ballot to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| So they don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| They will have instructions about what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| It's the same way that we deal with people who want to do it absentee if they're over 65 or they're disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| We have a lot of people that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| So we have this mechanism set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| This is not something new we're going to have to do for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Could you set it up where it's not absolutely required the first couple of elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| but that they might have the choice and when they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| and voted a precinct that you would say, hey, from now on you have to, it's mandatory that you do a write-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| Something along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Have you considered anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| The measure that we are promoting is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| That's the way it came from the legislature and the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| Obviously, you all can do whatever you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| but I can tell you I strongly support the mandatory language simply to eliminate this issue from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4256)|
| 1:11:05| It sounds like anybody that knows anything about running elections supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| I think I'll agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| To date, and like I had told several of you all privately, this is not a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| This isn't something supported by Democrats or, you know, only by Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Both parties have supported this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| I just have a question following up Council Palmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| What are they going to do about the photo IDs that don't have pictures on them, seniors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Well, that's what I want to emphasize, that this year, whatever they've got, they've been using, they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4295)|
| 1:11:45| That's something we're going to inform the public about for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| And I don't have all the answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I've read the bills, but there's some questions there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| and I'm awaiting guidance from the state because we need to do this uniformly across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| And I don't want to misspeak at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| but I just want everybody to understand these elections coming up this year, they don't have to have a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4324)|
| 1:12:12| I dodged your question a little bit, but I don't want to say too much about it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| There's nothing in the bill that talks about seniors and people without a photo ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| Not for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| The bill that you're talking about, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| and there's going to be a mechanism set up, as I understand it, the Department of Safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| so they can go over there and get a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| But I don't want to be telling everybody to run over there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| I don't speak for the Department of Safety, and that's why I was trying to avoid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I don't know where they are in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| That law will be effective July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| So I was trying to stay out of that, but you just wouldn't let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Mr. Rogers, you and I discussed on the phone the process for someone to property qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| and I think it might be useful for the folks watching the meeting to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| If you are not previously property qualified to vote in a city election, you will not receive this ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| You know, folks might assume, if they hadn't registered before, that suddenly they're on a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| Could you review how someone qualifies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| They're either on that list or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| And I think you had spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| It was when we talked about your understanding that perhaps they had to come down there personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| you know, with their original deed of trust, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| And I did some inquiries around my office after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| and that is certainly one procedure for them to come down there and prove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| But we have also, as I understand it, received copies in the mail of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| and then we will look that property up, and if that property on, I think it's KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| if it shows that they're in fact the owner and everything else is in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| then we can get them registered that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| But this is a procedure that I'm going to look into because I'm not sure how much of it has to be a certain way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| and how much of it is somewhat discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| We just need to be satisfied that this is the owner of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| and that the property meets the 4,000 square foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| My understanding is that the person has to be a resident of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Own property within the City of Knoxville, but not reside within the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| And then there is a procedure to property qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| And once they have done that qualification process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| then they're on this list from which you would mail them an absentee ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Cliff, thank you for your professionalism in addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| There's one thing I think we should mention and ask you to mention is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| what is the deadline for getting your absentee ballot in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| It's going to be before the election date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| And I can see where someone might get something in the mail and maybe kick back a little too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| If you wait until election day, it's obviously too late, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| You've got to have it in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Well, here we go again on one that I was hoping we could avoid tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| Normally this is going to happen in September, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Well, the election is September the 27th, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| And normally the deadline is 45 days for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| However, the state coordinator of elections, if we're running up against deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| can give us an extension to say 30 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| And my reading of the statute indicates it applies to city elections and to special elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| both of which we happen to have coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| But I don't want to say that with absolute certainty because that is not my discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| That's going to be up to the state coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| So we'll have, again, more information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| But tonight, just to give you some general parameters, that's all I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| But I was just thinking that sometimes people get on autopilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| and if you're used to driving to the precinct where you voted because that's where the property was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| you might be inattentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| Hopefully you get the letter and you observe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| But there will be the requirement, whatever it is, 45, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| or some other days where you get your absentee ballot in or you've missed that election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| and that will be before election day, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, we'll mail them the ballot, and then they'll have to mail it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| But I really think that it's not going to be that much of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| And I think most of the people that do this will be appreciative of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| that they don't have to get in their car and drive to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| I wasn't suggesting to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| I was just reminding people, I guess, who might not be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| or might not be thinking about this that they need to act in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| in getting an absentee ballot back to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And that deadline, Council Member DelVolpe, will be very specific in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| We'll have instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| In the notice that you get in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Council Member Roddy pointed out you have to be a resident of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| And do you have to be a resident of Knox County to vote in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| No, you could be a resident of another county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| So it's not just, but it isn't somebody that, say, owns property in Texas and Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| and owns property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| It has to be somebody who is a resident of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| and is not otherwise entitled to vote in the city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| They're not a resident here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Seeing no other lights, I think we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| And the office thanks you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| We have one person signed up for public forum, Robert Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| If you would come down and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| My name is Robert Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| I'm at 1515 Isabella Circle here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| And I brought this up to the vice mayor a few minutes ago right before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4686)|
| 1:18:14| Whatever happened to the two gentlemen that tried to put a miniature theme park on World's Fair Park about 25 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| And what's the proposal about trying to get some kind of theme park in the town of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| so we can get people to come in and spend money and where the town would be able to make some money out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4707)|
| 1:18:37| Are you addressing that question to anyone in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| I cannot remember the two gentlemen that was behind this ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| It looked real great on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Watkins is probably who you're thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| I believe vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Vice mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| You're probably thinking about the Warsham Watkins plan that was on the table for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| I think you're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Anything we can do to entice people to come into our city and spend money, that's the way to run the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| I think it would be a great thing because, you know, we have a piece of property there just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| Of course, we do use it for other things like concerts and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| But having some kind of miniature theme park would bring people into the town like we did during the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| And I believe having something like that would bring a lot of money into this town where we'd be able to make money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| Well, that's duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| And we'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| It may be an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Does anyone else have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| If there are no further comments, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4780)|
| 1:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110628?start=4804)|
