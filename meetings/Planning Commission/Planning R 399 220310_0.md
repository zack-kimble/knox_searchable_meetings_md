| 0:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Mr. Ammons, you're free to come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Please give us your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=903)|
| 0:15:15| Dan Ammons, Jr., 4704 Meredith Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| I don't have a whole lot to say other than this is a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| This person has been my neighbor for a long time and was looking to sell the property and had approached us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| And so we are requesting for commercial, working with the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| Originally it was last meeting we were looking for all that CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| but we had decided with the fact that it would make part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| it would isolate two of the properties that were residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| We're looking at leaving that as ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| It's existing as ag, and that would make, I think the planning staff used the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| a substandard lot since it was ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| so was looking to make that RA to meet the rest of the residents around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| I don't have anything else to say unless somebody has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| All right. Thank you, Mr. Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Hearing no other comments, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| I had a question for staff about a comment that came in from the community that regarded the potential to use CN instead of CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| I just wondered what ramifications that might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| The comment was regarding that allowing more buffer and protection for the residences around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| That would be a question for, I guess, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| I would draw your attention to Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Staff's recommendation is trying to provide a buffer by allowing for the RA zoning to be adjacent to the CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1011)|
| 0:17:03| rather than having the CA zoning go all the way out to the edge of the parcel line adjacent to the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1023)|
| 0:17:14| Would you like to see Exhibit A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1037)|
| 0:17:28| The sector plan amendment is showing an extension of GC limited to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| The applicant asked for it to go all the way to the edge of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| If you could scroll down one more, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| CA then is sort of squared up there, and you can still see that there is a residentially zoned buffer along the edge of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1064)|
| 0:17:56| Can I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| So under CA zoning, it's my understanding, and that's what the rest of the property is, that it would be used for storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| which is what it has the potential for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| It would require use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| So whenever we got engineering, it would actually be back before the county and the planning to be looked at as use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1096)|
| 0:18:27| which could incorporate any kind of buffer that might be needed under CA zoning as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1107)|
| 0:18:38| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Yeah, I just wanted to commend staff on doing a really good job taking what was applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| and making it work well with what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| I think this is a good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| I think the first thing, I'd like to go ahead and make a motion on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| We can continue to discuss zoning if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I'd like to make a motion we approve the sector plan amendment to GC for the portion of the property as proposed in Exhibit A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| because it's a minor extension of the land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Before we vote, Chair will recognize Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| I was going to say the same thing as Commissioner Smith, that I like the buffer option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| and leaving that property zone RA if they want to come back later here in a couple, three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| and get that piece built and accumulate some more property and go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| I think that would be appropriate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I think staff's got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I see no other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, second by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| to approve the sector plan amendment to GC general commercial per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning to CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| And RA, excuse me, per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| So moved, per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Scott Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| to approve CA general business and RA low density residential per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Before we get into item 13, could you raise your hand please if you're here on behalf of item 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| which is MP development on Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| So the good majority of the people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Seeing that you have a number of people, chair will, there's no objection from commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| I'll add an extra five minutes on public comments, up to a total of ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| and the applicant will have additional ten minutes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| So this is item 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| File 3B22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| The applicant is MP development group LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Location, south side of Irwin Drive, east of Grizzly Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Track size is 53.97 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Present zoning is RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Zoning requested, planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Density proposed up to 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| Staff recommendation, approve planned residential zoning up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| because it is compatible with surrounding development and consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Mr. Mullins, is there opposition, which there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Mr. Mullins, would you like the opposition to go first or would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| I'll let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| Mr. Kline, we'll give you all ten minutes, and I know there's others who are desiring to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| so if you could be considerate of their time and give them additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| I will, and thank you for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| We have a lot of people here and a lot of different interests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| My name is Wayne Kline, Hodges Dining and Carson 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| I represent and am the spokesperson for approximately 80 or more families surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| or adjacent to this property, which transfers to over 200 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| in opposition to this proposed change in rezoning for this approximate 54 acres of land located at 704 Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| Also in opposition here today are directors, pastors of Temple Baptist Church and Crown College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| which I'm going to defer to them for a statement at the end of my talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| I ask all those in opposition to this application to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Let their presence in opposition be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| It's important to note that my clients are understanding of the need for residential development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| However, pursuant to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, Article VI, Section 30.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| the required conditions cannot be met for this rezoning as it is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| One of the criteria is that the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Within this property's 54 acres, approximately three-quarters of the parcel fall within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1406)|
| 0:23:35| Considering the environmental constraints on this property and the hillside and ridgetop protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| PR zoning is acceptable to my clients because it provides an opportunity to concentrate development on the non-hillside portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| However, concentrating residential density at 3.5 dwelling units per acre along Irwin Drive is completely out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1430)|
| 0:23:59| with the adjacent properties and would overwhelm the only approximate 13 to 15 acres of developable property on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| That would equate to 189 units, which would be 13 dwelling units per acre on this developable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| My clients agree with your staff recommendation to the extent it reduces the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| A density of one dwelling unit per acre would align more closely with the intent of the existing and surrounding low-density residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| and the residential character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| One dwelling unit per acre for the entire property and then allowing clustering on the developable 13 to 15 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| would allow approximately four dwelling units per acre on this 13 to 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| This is out of character for the neighborhood, and that is why a PR density of one dwelling unit per two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| is more in line with residential development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| It's important to note that your applicant's attorney wants to compare this property to Grizzly Creek subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| which is much smaller in size and acreage, has none of the problems associated with the hillside and ridgetop consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| and is misleading in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| In this case, using the property's acreage to inflate the number of dwelling units that could be built on the developable part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| would be a misuse of your planning tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| It would cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| violate the existing character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| and pose traffic hazards for drivers and schoolchildren using nearby roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| And I'm not going to comment on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| It's covered in the comments from the folks, and I don't have time, really, to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| But I would support and admonish the commission to look at the traffic problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| because it's a major component of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| And most importantly, the majority of this property is not suitable for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Most of the land is 25 to 75 percent sloped and rocky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| The topo map available on KGIS illustrates the unsuitability based upon the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| According to the Knox County Soil Survey, which is also available on KGIS soil maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| the vast majority of the property's soils are unsuitable or poorly suited for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| According to Tables 11 and 12 of the Knox County Soil Survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| these soil types are rated 1 on a 0 to 1 scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| with 1 denoting the most difficult soil type for development of dwellings, local road streets, and excavations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| One of the residents of Irwin Drive, who owns a home with his wife at 504 Irwin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| is an expert in environmental science with several decades of experience in managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1601)|

| 0:27:03| And I'm going to submit his CV for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| His comment is in the public comments, and his soil survey and evaluation of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| comports with Ms. Albertson's evaluation and provides that the suitability for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1635)|
| 0:27:25| based upon soil surveys and site factors means that only 13 to 15 acres of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| of this 50 acres, is suitable for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Not every piece of property is suitable for building a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| This one is not, given the drainage problems already posed by the sloping terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| the shallow depth, the bedrock which makes the property prone to erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| and difficult or impossible to install water and sewer lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| the restricted line of sight of the only road frontage for entrance of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| the increased traffic burden, the construction difficulties will impact this community in a negative sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1676)|

| 0:28:07| Although PR zoning is compatible, we're asking that you zone with density of one or less dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1687)|
| 0:28:17| And I'm going to put things in the record, and I defer the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Tim Tomlinson, 2307 West Beaver Creek Drive, Vice President of Administration at Crown College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| located just about two-tenths of a mile away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| We've been there 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| This road, Irwin Road, has been the road that, having many young drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| This is the road that we've tried to avoid for so many years because of its tragic traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| Between Crown College, Temple Baptist Academy, and Temple Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| which are all in the same area just down at the end of Irwin Road from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| we have 800 to 1,000 drivers two times a day who are coming to that very area of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| That Irwin Road is a common back cut that we try to avoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| and we feel like that the density recommendation is so high that it would be very tragic to many young drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| Again, about 800 to 1,000 additional drivers in the morning and in the afternoon every day just for those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| And there's also Powell High School and other schools just across the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Some are coming from that part of the county and trying to cut through there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I yield to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Your name, please, and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| My name is James Zinker. I address 1700 West Beaver Creek Drive, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| I represent the Temple Baptist Church, Dr. Clarence Sexton, and the 3,146 families that are represented as members of our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1784)|
| 0:29:53| I want it to be noted that we stand in solidarity with our neighbors firmly against this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| We are not against development, but we are against placing this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| in an already very dangerous transportation route that is narrow, hilly, winding, and unsafe for additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| In our opinion, for serious safety reasons, this is exactly the worst place in Knox County for a development of its type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| With this number of units, it is a recipe for disaster in regards to road and traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| The members of Temple Baptist Church who vote and live in every precinct of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| will be carefully noting how this board decides on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| We're simply asking this board to do the very thing for which boards such as this have been established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| and I quote, to prevent dangerous and deleterious effects to the community by proposed expansion or development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| We want it noted that we stand with our neighbors against this proposal. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you, Mr. Zinker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| Dan Weber, 1700 West Beaver Creek Drive, Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I'm here to represent Temple Baptist Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and according to the published rezoning report that I have here on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| it gives traffic numbers, estimated traffic impact, and a student yield number here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| The issue that we take is that our school is not mentioned in that, Temple Baptist Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| just the Powell High School and Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And so with that being said, we believe that with the things that have already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| we're going to add between 200 and 300 vehicles a day just with our academy to those numbers that already exist in this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| let alone the additional numbers that were mentioned earlier by my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| We're opposed to the development here that would add to the population density in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| and would create an environment, particularly in vehicle numbers added to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and possibly make it more unsafe for our families and young drivers that access our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Showing that Abigail Malone has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| Also Barry Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| And Timothy Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Hello, I'm Abigail Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I live directly across from the 54 acres at 905 Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| I'm here to represent my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| We are strongly opposed to rezoning in the variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| We all have the same concerns, number one being flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| This property is not appropriate to clear and put such a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| This area is notorious for high water and flooding after any significant rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Two creeks originate on this property alone that flow into Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| carrying all sediment and materials from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Beaver Creek is an impaired waterway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Removing the vegetation on this property and replacing it with concrete and housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| could cause a catastrophic runoff that could damage our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and make our roads unsafe to drive across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Number two, it's already been mentioned, Irwin Road cannot handle this increased traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| blind hills, steep ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| It's narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| It barely reaches 15 feet of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| There are sharp curves on either side of the entrance to this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| This proposed rezoning and development is not in character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| with the existing surrounding low-density zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| I urge you to restrict zoning to that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I urge NBC members to restrict zoning to that portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| that lies outside the hillside and redshot protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| and adopt the one dwelling per acre or lower recommendation by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I tried to hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Barry Rosen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I see we're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Mr. Rosen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I'll defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Timothy Tomlinson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I already split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Anyone else that has signed up to speak that you've not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| You want to come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We'll give you a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Please provide your name and address, sir, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I'm not going to go over the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I'm sorry, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Michael Cox, 7219 Fair Lane Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So I'm not going to waste your time going over the concerns that have been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I think they're backed up with fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| What I'd like to appeal to is your moral decisions in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| I know it's hard to sit there at the board and make decisions sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| when you actually haven't put eyes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| But, you know, we took an oath just a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| about doing what was best for the total community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| And I think, from what you've heard, if you lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| or if you visited that area and you saw the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| people have moved there, they've lived there a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| maybe all their lives, and they moved there for a certain reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I do think we're not opposed to growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| but I do think staying with the one development unit per acre is in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and it would look great, it would allow us growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| and it wouldn't cause all the concerns that everyone's voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| And I've been up here about three or four times and I see a lot of new faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| so I'm hopeful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| So thank you very much. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Mr. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Mr. Mullins, you have 12 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2115)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you, board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I'm here with the applicant in B Development, Chad Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I'm right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| He's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| He's with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Well, Mr. Roberts is a local developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| He lives in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| In fact, he had eyes on this property with the intent of not only developing a portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| but putting his personal residence on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| So he does want to be a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| and he does want to be part of this neighborhood with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| And it's not so much staff's recommendation on this is for one dwelling unit an acre for PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| which would allow approximately 53 units to be developed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And it's not so much that we have an issue with staff's recommendation for one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| We asked for 3.5 dwelling units an acre for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| One, we don't exactly know what we're going to do with the balance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Our initial plan is to put a small subdivision, 15 to 17 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| on the portion where the driveway is located on the property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| And those are going to be single-family residential units that are going to be available for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| It's going to serve a unique market where it's a rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| but you have a detached single-family unit with a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| And that is a product that Mr. Roberts has developed in other areas in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| and had a lot of success doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| So that was the initial plan in addition to putting his own residence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| What would be done with the balance of the property is undetermined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| So the ask of 3.5 dwelling units an acre was to give him more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| in evaluating what options he may have on the property moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| It is a challenging piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| That's why the PR zone is the most appropriate zone for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| And the density that is requested is simply that, is an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Even if it is granted here today and is approved by county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| there's no guarantee that you can get anywhere near 3.5 dwelling units an acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| There's a lot of engineering that's going to have to go into looking at the suitability of the soils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| where it can be developed, looking at the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| studying the stormwater to make sure that post-development flows do not exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| what the pre-development water running off that property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Now, we all know these are things that get worked out at the use-on-review stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| during the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| But the reason 3.5 dwelling units an acre is actually compatible is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and Ms. Albertson made a statement to this on Tuesday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and it's true that there is a lot of large acre lots in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| Mr. Roberts and I met with many of these neighbors behind us on Tuesday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| to talk about some of these issues, and they told us this subdivision there had been there since 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Lots of things have changed since 1965 in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| For one, there was no sector plans in 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| When we started putting sector plans down, we chose this to be low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| which in the county is defined as up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| There was no growth policy plan in 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| That came around in 2001, and the growth policy plan that was put in place 22 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| identified this as a planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| It didn't identify it as a rural area, which would restrict densities to two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| unless there's water and sewer, and then you can go up to three if there's potential factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| such as water, sewer, and a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| But it put it as planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| It is adjacent to an urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| And when Mr. Klein talks about developable property, I want to be really careful how we define that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| and make sure we're defining that consistent with the zoning ordinance, the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| and the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| We all know the hillside protection plan is in place here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| and there's a ridgetop along the back of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| and there are some steeper slopes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| But the developable property, if you want to call it that, is not constrained to just 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| If you look in staff's report, the slope analysis that they have attached in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| it gives you the hillside recommended density calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| starting at five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| which is the maximum you can get in the low-density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Non-hillside is approximately 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| and I believe that's where Mr. Klein is probably looking at his definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| of what a developable piece of property would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| But you also have slopes up to 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| which is, according to the hillside protection plan, 100% developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| And that is another 3.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Between 15% and 25% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| the hillside plan says you can develop up to two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| twice as much as what has been recommended here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| And that is another 7.82 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Things between 25% and 40%, which is 13.88 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| you can get a half dwelling unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| which is, incidentally, I believe what he's asking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| So when you look at what can be developed under the hillside protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| which is not even mandated in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| you're looking at 40 acres that can be developed, not the 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Mr. Klein's argument also appears to be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| well, okay, you should have 15, one unit an acre or half unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| but it should be constrained only to develop on that 15 acres that's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| That is in strict violation and contravention of what the general plan allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| And this was litigated a few years ago in another case in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| I'm going to read you from a case of Benson v. Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| It says, according to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| clustered housing preserves open space by concentrating development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| onto certain portions of a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| rather than spreading it evenly over the tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| The total number of units allowable in a clustered development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| is calculated by multiplying the number of permitted units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| by the total number of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Then the allowable residential units transferred from the total developable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| and concentrated into areas more suitable for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| In the view of Knox County, clustering should be encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| because it can, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| conserve natural features and reduce stormwater runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| as well as prevent residential sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| and help to preserve the agrarian roots of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| The same argument in the Benson case was made, as Mr. Klein is making here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| You don't count the areas that you can't build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| but the general plan says, no, you can count them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| and we want to then allow you to then cluster them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| in areas where it can be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| which in this area, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| there's no part of this property that can't be, in theory, developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| We all know engineering and costs prohibit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| and they would cluster in the areas that would be more easily developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| And that is what we would come forward with a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| probably more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| His initial plan is a small subdivision first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| and then evaluate what options he may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and come forward with future plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| And every time that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| this body will get an opportunity to review those plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| look at the stormwater, look at the issues with runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| look at the traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| and evaluate whether or not that plan makes sense for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| But when we're talking about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| and I heard a lot of concerns on Tuesday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| about traffic and reports about accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| and how the road is unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| so I did reach out at that time to Jim Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| with the Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| and asked him, okay, what about the traffic in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And there were some e-mail exchanges on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| and so I want to summarize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| And Mr. Snowden, I believe, or Mr. Fritz probably, is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| and could maybe add some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| At staff's recommendation, which would be 53 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| it would not trigger the need for a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| So there wouldn't be a full traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| at the development at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| At the density that we've requested, 3.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| there would be a traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| once cumulative units met that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| But even then, with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| the recommendation staff has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| the county probably would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| a flatter graded shoulder along the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| and that would improve the flow of Irwin Drive along...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| And there's almost 1,000 feet of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| on this property with Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| So that, in and of itself, is an opportunity to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| some of the conditions that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| If a full traffic impact analysis was commissioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| then they would study, you know, where can you widen the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| You know, the road starts out at 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| and then goes down to 17 feet in places near this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| And so there would be more opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| to study the traffic impacts and actually improve a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| Regarding the dangerous nature of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| we've heard some anecdotal evidence of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| but when I asked Mr. Snowden if he could look at the crash data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| he noted that there's been four crashes in the past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| One of them was a serious crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| He didn't have a traffic count for Irwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| so he couldn't really calculate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| where that would fall in the range of crash data for roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| but he said it would appear that the crashes are a below average rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| So, you know, I mean, unfortunately, you know, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| we are dealing with topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| We are dealing with roads that do need improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| That's not a reason to deny a rezoning with a requested density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| That is consistent with a subdivision that was approved in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| that's just 800 feet down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Now, I understand it is a smaller piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| but density is density, and density is applied per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| not looking at the total acreage of a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| and that subdivision was built out about 3.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| We don't think we can get 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| but we would like at least an opportunity to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| do the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| and determine what type of development would work best on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| So with that, I would ask that you approve the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| at the applicant's request of 3.5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Yeah, I had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So when we're talking about the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| you make reference to, I think based on that analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| it was 106 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I think, if you look at my letter, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Yeah, the analysis, if you applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| if the hillside protection plan was fully in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| and we took it with the amount of density that is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| in the low density residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| and then applied the hillside protection restrictions on density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| it would give you 116.8 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| 116.8, which would be about 2.19 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| And that's applying the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| as if it were fully in full force and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Okay, yeah, and so when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| you're not talking about developing the steeper 25 and above percent grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| You're not talking about actually affecting physically that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| You're talking about using that density calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| to allocate that density to the flatter areas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| I went out to that property today, and I didn't get on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| but I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| It doesn't seem like an area that vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| or attached units would fit in well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I mean, are you, do you think you can accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| that many units on that flatter area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| There's no intent to go vertical on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| and I understand that that probably would be out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Again, that's something that I think if there were a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| to come forward with that type, then at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| the planned residential zone would be able to allow use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| to review that and see whether that is in conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| But right now, we're looking at single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| And so, you know, I don't, again, I don't think we can get 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| We asked for it because the metrics that we look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| the growth policy plan, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| other developments in the area that have been rezoned more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| that all those look at this being something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| than what you would expect in a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| because it's not considered a rural area by the plans we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Yeah, I don't know that you could physically get 10 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and detach single-family units on a certain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| you know, without stacking or attaching units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| So I think the most important thing or one of the things that I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| is that hillside protection and staying off of the steeper slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| and I don't think it benefits your client to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| And one thing that, you know, the current zoning is RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| and that's the zoning for everybody's property that's behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| They all have RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| That zoning allows, as of right, with a minimum of 10,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| they can go now and put four units an acre on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| without coming to this body for use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| The tradeoff is that you're restricted to 10,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| and that would not allow you to cluster the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| So in order to go to a planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| to give this body more oversight into the process later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| you're giving up a permitted use of four units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| to look at a planned use later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I have one more question. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Just real quick, you're going to do rental possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Is that all multiple houses on one lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| or does each individual unit have its own lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Do you subdivide the lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Yeah, they do subdivide the lots, but they're all owned by the same owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| I think that the staff has this exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| I think that planned residential is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| just for this type of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| or this type of a land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| where most of the land, three-quarters of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| is basically unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| And what they're doing is allowing the land to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| It still has value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| And by clustering the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| if they can put 54 houses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| if you took, like, the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| I doubt that they could get 54 houses on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| They wouldn't have to do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Or if you say that you have 15 acres that you can develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| and you could develop it at three-and-a-half to the acre or four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| what do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| You get the same number of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| This way, you're taking the density off the unused part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| and using it where you can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| And I think it's a really good use of the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| I think it's a fair use of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Therefore, I'm going to make a motion that we approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3130)|
| 0:52:20| Ladies and gentlemen, please wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| At one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| That is staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| to approve PR, planned residential zoning, up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| Any further comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Seeing none, chair will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| We'll take a brief minute or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3175)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3205)|
| 0:53:42| Next item is agenda item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3225)|

| 0:56:02| You still have time left over if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| We do have Norm Anderson signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| Mr. Anderson, you want to come to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| My name is Norm Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| I live at 12331 Daisywood Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| I've only recently begun to attend these proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| as the Couch Mill development came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| As newly appointed representative of our Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| I decided to see how our public opinion actually made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| At last month's meeting, the commissioners heard a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| of 12 dwelling units per acre near a town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| and district zone for such density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| During discussion, Commissioner Buehler stated this was, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| in his neighborhood and quickly voiced his opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| made a motion to amend the Planning Commission approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| from 12 to 4 dwelling units per acre, which was then seconded and voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| In the audience, we noted this seemed to strike a nerve with the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| It was, again, quote, in his neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| We applauded his efforts, and the meeting moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Later, the Thunder Mountain development was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Legal representation for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| as well as many members of the community were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| A hearty discussion took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Ultimately, the vote was suspended for 60 days to allow for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| to meet with the community to work towards a compromise of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| infrastructure, and other details before a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| would be introduced for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Let me recap a section from the meeting a month prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| to when the Couch Mill development rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| was being heard by commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| As you are aware, you all, the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| approved the rezoning for up to two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| and as a Hardin Valley resident, I took that as a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| As Commissioner Hill represented the wishes of her constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| by proposing the amendment of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| for this development, it sparked no discussion, no second, and no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| However, in a brief breach of etiquette, Mr. Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| who I'm sure I don't have to remind you does not represent District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| seized what could be construed as an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| to sell more trash collection accounts by making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| to amend the plan up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| for the Couch Mill plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| This was quickly seconded by a commissioner not representing District 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| and voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Where I come from, the optics of this move do not reflect well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| upon the system or the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| So that brings us to this meeting to review, discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| and either approve or disapprove the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| of 2.74 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| on 131 acres of sinkhole-riddled pastureland on Couch Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| a road that has seen very little attention with regards to maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| from the county in the ten years that I've lived in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| While the traffic impact assessment and concept plan both clearly state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| that this development will have negligible effect on traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| schools, or infrastructure, and that the density matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| the current landscape, it simply does not have eyes to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| the falsehood in those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| While some recent developments have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| with these higher densities due to some inconsistent interpretations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| of the so-called expired growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| only one other bears the magnitude of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| At 131 acres and nearly 400 homes, it is the largest development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| one of the largest developments in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Variances have been requested to allow for this density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| and the initial impression from the residents is that we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| to put the proverbial 10 pounds of stuff in the 5-pound bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I'm tired of hearing developers and even some of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| say that everyone wants to be the last one in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| that we don't want development in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Nothing could be further from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| We want responsible development after the promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| infrastructure improvements have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| which will make more feasible for the responsible development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| The proposed roadway improvements mentioned, such as a widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| of Couch Mill and a roundabout at Steel Road and Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| assume that the current property owners are willing to concede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| their property for such actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| I'm not sure that is the case, and if it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| the county can't afford the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I'm pleased to see that this plan does recognize that a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| number of Hardin Valley residents work in Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| and that the new residents of this proposed development would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| likely follow that trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| However, the routes suggested to get to those workplaces are not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| routes likely to be taken by most residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| I know this because I am one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Swafford Road, which is one of the routes projected in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| is only a route that I would use if I lived on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| As a matter of fact, my GPS has never brought me to either my work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| nor my home from anywhere via Swafford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| And then to take that to Solway Road to turn left on Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| in morning traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| No one would attempt to do that twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| I use Couch Mill to East Gallaher Ferry to Hickory Creek to Everett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and then Watt Road to I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| While this might sound like a simple argument to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| it is the reality of the current traffic situation in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| As unmaintained and unready for increased traffic volume as Couch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Mill Road is, East Gallaher Ferry is merely an improved farm trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| and Hickory Creek Road has innumerable sinkholes on its edges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Heavy truck and equipment movement along these roads will only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| worsen the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Fix the infrastructure, then allow the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| To do it backwards only prolongs the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I urge you, Planning Commission, to consider disapproving this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3662)|

| 1:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Ms. Wilkinson, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| Can you make a few comments real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Because we went over the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Can you just kind of wrap it up if you could, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| We'll give you a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| My name is Penny Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I live on Couch Mill Road in Knoxville, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| And Mr. Reynolds, thank you for writing me back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| That did answer some of my questions, but I still have a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| more that I'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| In December, the Knox County Planning staff recommended this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| be rezoned to PR up to two dwelling units per acre because in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| opinion of the planning staff, it was consistent with the Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| County Sector Plan and the Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Also in December, the slope analysis and the rezoning report yielded a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| maximum of 1.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| But now the planning staff is recommending an approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| development concept plan at 2.74 dwelling units per acre, what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| currently have it at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| And suddenly this is now consistent with the general plan and sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| plan, and the slope analysis is no longer of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| The maximum density of 1.9 dwelling unit acres has actually been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| removed from the slope analysis report, and now the only concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| whether or not the project is consistent with the maximum land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| disturbance outlined by the Hillside Protection Land Disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| So the use is clearly not compatible with the character of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| neighborhood where it's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| This is where the biggest confusion comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| There is not a single home to the immediate north, south, east, or west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| of this property that only has ten feet between adjacent homes, five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| foot setbacks from property line to structure as outlined in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| This property is in a rural area and still not in the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| area of the northwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| On the first page of your case file report, you state that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| surrounding land use and zoning to the north is agriculture, forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| vacant, SFR, rural residential, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| To the south is agricultural, forestry, vacant, A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| To the east is agricultural, forestry, vacant, single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| residence, rural residential, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| And to the west is agricultural, forestry, vacant, and A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| And the site plan here yields quarter acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And then on page 15 of your report, it says that each planned unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| development shall be compatible with surrounding or adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| And then it also says the proposed subdivision will have to test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| residential lot sizes and setbacks that are similar to the others in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| So I'm curious which statement is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| I'm curious how a quarter acre lot sizes are similar to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Also, the developer is requesting a reduction in the setback from 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| feet to 25 feet, and that is still similar to the properties in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| surrounding area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Are you sure that this is compatible with the character of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| And then you also state that this will not draw additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| through the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| And while couch mill has been referred as a major collector or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| minor collector, it's still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| There's homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| There's driveways that come out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Unless these folks are not going to drive cars, 360 homes isn't going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| to do a deed and draw additional traffic through these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I understand that you're doing the best that you can with what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| have to work with, and it's not you but our elected commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| that rezone this property to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| But let me point out that the basis for the motion in January was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| because the developer was willing to help with road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| And one of the commissioners said that this is what Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| has been asking for, road improvements, structure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Yes, that's what we've been asking for, but not on couch mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| We need it on Hardin Valley Road where people are trying to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| work and trying to get their kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| I think I've used up all my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| But thank you for listening today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Mr. Hardin, you have additional time if you'd like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| the commission further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| This is a rather large piece of property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| We've taken some great care to design around the sink holes and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| other parts here that have limited us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| We've clustered the development into the better portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| And once you get away from the sink holes, it actually lays out quite nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Part of our dedication here for the community is over, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| 33 acres of common area and usable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| We've got an extreme network of walking trails throughout the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| And for the other things where we asked for the reduction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| peripheral setback, what we did there was we gave a section of common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| area between us and the neighbors right there that would leave that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| into common area right there to add even a greater setback or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| greater buffer area that homeowners can't touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| It will be in the homeowners association, and we can leave that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| So that was the rationale there to ask for the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| My developers have agreed to go out in realizing that we do have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| impact on the road situation, so they've agreed to assist with Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| County in the upgrades to Couch Mill Road out to Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| So we'll be redoing that road and also the intersection there with Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| We have researched the right-of-way situation, and there is adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| right-of-way along Couch Mill right now through the previous platting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| process that everybody has already platted enough property there for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| do the required improvements along Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| We've presented you a plan that meets what the current zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| So, you know, it meets what the current zoning was done at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| And the one variance that we did ask for was a broken back curve variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| so it's not, and staff agrees that it's not really that, it's not hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| and it won't really create a traffic problem in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| And a broken back curve is a tangent length between two curves on a roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| So we've just shortened that down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| It didn't quite meet the standard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| So, you know, I can answer any questions right there, but I think what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| here is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| It has quite a bit of amenities, a lot of open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| We have a clubhouse and a pool and other activities, areas there for our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| can use and also for anybody else in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| Like I said, I've not measured how long the walking trails are, but it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| it'll be a mile or so of walking trails along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| So with all that, I can answer any questions, and like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| we are in agreement with the staff and urge that your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Thank you, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Seeing no other comments, Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| Mr. Harbin, can you speak to the question about the two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| 241 and 262 on this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Are those the large ones right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| The large ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| And the question is really around how they present such a bottleneck for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| common area, and if they were pulled back on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| it would really open that up and make it more accessible to the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Is there a reason that those are pulled so close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| Could they be pulled back slightly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Well, we can definitely reduce them some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| They're bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I thought that's the type of house, that's the type of lot that I live in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| and I sort of like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| It sort of gets me back away from my neighborhood right there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| So I thought that gave us an ability to put a house back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| and to have a little bit more privacy right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| So I like the lot like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| But, yeah, we can knock down the size of them some to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| I was speaking with the planning staff about what might be appropriate in terms of pulling that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| and I think to make the item number there, we have to put some kind of specific number there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4164)|
| 1:09:35| A hundred feet, is that what we could get to to pull both of those back to provide more access there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| What would the number be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| This is really odd to design each individual lot right here at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| My point in asking this is it came up from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| and I thought it was a reasonable request thinking about how that common space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| because you're right, I think this development is including a lot of common space amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| that we've all been really anxious to see, so I commend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| It's just this bottleneck right there kind of cuts it out and makes it part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| So you want a hundred feet between them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Okay, sure, we can make a hundred foot strip through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Where I've got about 25 with that walking trail coming through right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| you want a hundred feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Does that understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Is that what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I'm going to defer to planning staff about the most appropriate way to phrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| I guess when we discussed on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I could just throw out the idea of creating at least some kind of boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| or I guess something to shoot for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| And you're right, a hundred feet was total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| What I was just kind of throwing out there is an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| so 50 feet down the middle from both or I guess on the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| kind of on the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| If that's something that you all can consider, then yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| a hundred feet total is what I was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4266)|
| 1:11:15| Yes, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Just as the requirement that the common area between those two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| would be a hundred feet wide would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Can that be added as a number, 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| If that's a motion that you would make, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| May I make a motion to add that as an item 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| You're welcome to make a motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I'm making a motion to add that as 17 to allow for a hundred feet between 241 and 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4294)|
| 1:11:44| A hundred feet between lot 241 and 262, 262.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| Commissioner, we can do that when we get to the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| but I guess the first motion would be on the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Yes, just in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| I think the developer's done a great job of listening to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| We've heard requests for walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| We've heard requests for more sidewalks and amenities and open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| and this project has, I think, 34 acres of common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| I guess I don't really respect what you're saying about the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| but I don't think engineering plans at the meeting is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| I think the lots are good the way they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| and I think it's nice to have them because they're bigger than most of the other lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| They offer something a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| and I would probably be supportive of leaving that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| I think it's a good layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| and I think sometimes when we try to re-engineer things during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| there may be unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| or unintended situations that make it not a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| so I would probably not agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Anyway, I'd like to make a motion on the variance portion of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| I would make a motion that we approve the variance and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| on the justifications provided by applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| and recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| and because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| All right, we have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| second by Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| We approve the variances and alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| first dash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Chair will entertain a motion on the concept plan subject to the 16 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| I would like to make a motion to add a 17th condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| that would allow for 100 feet between lots 241 and 262.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Let's approve the 16 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| approve the concept plan subject to the 16 conditions plus an additional condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Mr. Harbin, I'd like your opinion, not your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| but your professional opinion on the 100 feet that we're discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| Is that a doable thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Is it a just it really doesn't make any difference whether we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| or whether we don't do it or if we add it, is it going to hurt anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| The lots are plenty large right now the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| You think it's fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| They'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Go ahead and add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Just go ahead and add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| You're still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| I'd like to point out the amenities in this PR concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| having sidewalks throughout the entire subdivision is a really great thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| that we know the neighborhood's been asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| And it also kind of reminded me of last month when I tried to propose a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| a single sidewalk, and it was kind of looked over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| that we could have proposed that as a private sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| as a private amenity in a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And that's just something we can keep in mind in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| It doesn't have to be a public sidewalk in a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| So I think this is a good plan, incorporating private sidewalks throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And I think the 100-foot sort of separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| if you were to put fences on each of those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| I think it would create a sort of weird dark zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| where you couldn't see what's happening on a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I mean a private sort of greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| which you don't really want to have hidden dark areas that kids go and hang out in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| So I think increasing that to 100 feet would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| Chair, I'll second the motion, if you need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Well, we do need a second, so I'll accept that second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| So we have a motion by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| to approve the concept plan subject to 16 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4593)|

| 1:17:52| It will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| We have variances in alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| concept plan and development approval with peripheral setback reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| Subdivision is Irwin Acres, file 3SB22C and 3C22UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4682)|
| 1:18:11| Applicant developer is Robert C. Campbell and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| Location, south of Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| near the intersection of Tazewell Pike and Finehorn Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| Zoning is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| Number of lots, 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| We do have five variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| We do have an alternative design standards requiring commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Approve variances one through five in the alternative design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| based on the justifications provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| And because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Also, staff recommends approve the concept plan subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| Third is to approve the development plan for 70 detached residential houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| on individual lots and the peripheral setback reduction from 35 feet to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| for all double frontage lots adjacent to the 25-foot common area strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| along East Emery Road frontage subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Would you like to go first or would you like to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| I'll briefly go first and then reserve the balance of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| As you all know, this was on consent earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| It was taken off of consent by Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| He has some questions and concerns, I believe, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| I'd like to hear what he has to say before I address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Staff has recommended approval for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| As you'll recall, this body voted initially to approve this as planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| at nine dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| It's a mixed-use special district that calls for medium-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| Between the time of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| and the county commission's ultimate vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| the applicant and Mr. Campbell came forward with this concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| or a version of this concept plan, which proposed about 3.2 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| As a result of that concept plan, when this went through county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| they approved the rezoning to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| That would be consistent with what was here instead of what this body had voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| We think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| We would ask that you follow staff's recommendation and approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| and I'd like to hear from the opposition and maybe address any concerns they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Mr. Murphy, please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| There's about four people from the Gibbs Planning Advocates that all had conflicts today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| and asked if I was going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I said I would, so they asked me if I could just say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Their main concern about this development is access to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| It's how do children safely get to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| and the primary barrier for that is the Tazewell Pike and Emory Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| TDOT redid that back about 2019 and put a stoplight in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| but there's not a pedestrian crossing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| This is on the southeast side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| The sidewalk up to the schools is on the northwest side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| My understanding after checking with engineering today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| and I'd love if they can make some comments and let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| is that there is actually apparently now an agreement to put in the pedestrian crossing at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| So that's fantastic news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| We're really happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| That is something that the community really needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| The Gibbs area is identified for this special use, mixed-use district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and that intersection is a complete barrier to bicycle traffic, people traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| and if you've actually tried to make a left-hand turn there, it's actually really tough too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I've almost gotten hit twice in that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| So if that's the case, we're really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| But while I'm on the topic of sidewalks, I wanted to talk about why are they important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| First, this one in particular is in the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| or sorry, parental responsibility zone for all three Gibbs schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| so the elementary, middle school, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Any students here without sidewalks will have to get to school via private vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| I'm quite sure no parent would want their child to try and walk or ride a bike through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4958)|
| 1:22:46| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Sidewalks are good too for accessing for public health and for getting people out walking, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| There are actually retail and shopping establishments within a pretty easy walk of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| So if there is actually sidewalk access, we're actually going to see this begin to turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| If this pedestrian crossing is put in, we'll see it turn into a more walkable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| The final one was really driven home to me by a couple that I was talking to at an event earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| They had just moved to Knox County recently from out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| and I was asking them what some of the issues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| This couple, one of them is visually impaired, requires an assistance canine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| as well as uses walking sticks if she's visually impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| And one of their primary criteria for where they're looking and can actually live and thrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| is where are places that have sidewalks, where are places that have sidewalks that aren't uneven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| that don't have overgrowth from unmaintained lots next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| And it really struck me that just by simply putting sidewalks in subdivisions, outside of subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| and at these crossings, we make this a much better community for a number of our community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| who have some disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| So I'm very pleased if Engineering will provide some more details about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| And I checked with the Gibbs Planning Board before I got here, and they were excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| They're like, okay, this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| So that's my comments, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| And a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| One-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Excuse me, Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I got ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Go ahead, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Just briefly, the issue of the sidewalks and the pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| that's actually addressed in staff's report on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| It does talk about there has been conversations with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| There is an existing sidewalk stub that comes out on the Weigels property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| that just kind of goes to nowhere there at the church property access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| And since we're in the parental responsibility zone, we have about 650, I believe, feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5089)|
| 1:24:57| We're actually going to shift that sidewalk from the development west to connect into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| And there were already plans with the county about improving that pedestrian access across walks along the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| So we're partnering with them to take part in those plans altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| and that's going to be worked out in the permitting phase, and that's captured in staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5115)|
| 1:25:24| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Are you sure this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| I was going to say, so I went to Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| and you have not lived until you have walked from the high school to the Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| at the middle of the day on a Friday afternoon traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| So I'm grateful to hear that there's plans for the pedestrian crosswalks and stuff to improve that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| However, you know, just thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| if we were going to wait until sidewalks are put in for any development to go in the parental zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| I graduated literally years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| and no development that's there now would have happened in the last almost 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5158)|
| 1:26:06| So if we're waiting for just sidewalks to go in, we're never going to get development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| So I think everything that I've seen on this is the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| I do hope that the county will take some serious consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| because I know a lot of students still to this day walk from the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| especially during football season, down to the Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| I can remember when the IGA used to be where Home Federal is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| That was a popular stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| So I do think there needs to be some stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| especially now that the middle school and elementary school are up in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| So I do want to implore our county road department to really look at sidewalks along Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| just to make it a little bit safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| But I don't think that should be something that holds us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| So that's really my comments, is just to kind of talk about, you know, what Mr. Murphy brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| which is valid concerns around safety and especially the parental zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| I just want to make sure we're not just going to stop approving things because of the parental zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| just because we would never approve anything if we're waiting on sidewalks to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5225)|

| 1:29:18| We do have two alternative design standards requiring Planning Commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5358)|

| 1:29:30| Staff recommendation, approve alternative design standards 1 through 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5370)|

| 1:29:43| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Staff also recommends approve the concept plan subject to 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5390)|

| 1:30:02| on individual lots and the peripheral setback reduction from 35 feet to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| for all double frontage lots with an adjacent 25-foot common area strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5409)|

| 1:30:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| There are two issues I wanted to bring up in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| I did send kind of a regurgitation of some comments from RIDA planning advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| It came out of a community meeting back in August when there was a rezoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| There's a number of those that are still potentially relevant for the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| One that's particularly relevant, Harris Road is a road that connects Washington Pike down to Babalay Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| and then farther down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| That is the road that there is a proposed entrance off the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| and that's how you get to the RIDA elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| It's probably also how you would get up to the Gibbs School, middle and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| So this is zone four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Harris is really windy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| It's steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| It is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| I think the traffic study said 17 to 19 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I was out there with a tape measure, and I think I found one place that was 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| I drove it on my way to the meeting, and it is really tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| I don't drive a very wide car, but I was definitely having a hard time keeping it squarely within the prescribed lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| It is also classified as a minor arterial, and from the major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| a minor arterial is supposed to have, by their spec, 11 foot wide lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| I think there's a requirement condition that I'm glad to see was added to at least widen it to at least an 18 foot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| That is still nine foot wide lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| This is hilly, narrow, and it is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| It did have a school bus overturned on the road back in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| and I think the quote from that news article was he called it a very slick and very dangerous hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| And rezoning, I think you heard from some residents that have testified to the number of cars that come off the road into their yards per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| So it's not in the zero cars. It's in the multiples of cars that come off the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| So Harris Road might consider making it even wider and more improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| Another suggestion I had, and I'd love to see this added as a condition, is to add pedestrian access over to Link Road on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5566)|
| 1:32:55| You have this very large piece of property that actually has three road frontages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| A pedestrian connection over to Link Road could allow residents of this subdivision to connect to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| there's some houses in a small, very small subdivision just north of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| and that could allow at least, you know, if you had kids that were playing together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| that would allow them to actually access that road safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| If they came out the subdivision entrance on Babley Road, that's not a safe route to get up to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| So a pedestrian connection there seems like something that would be really small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| very doable, and could actually help just your overall connectivity for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| So that would be great if maybe a condition could be added to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5619)|
| 1:33:51| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| Again, this was a concept plan used on review that was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| It has staff support for recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| It was zoned back in August, as Mr. Murphy referenced, to planned residential at 2.5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| This concept plan is in conformance with the proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| we allow density to 106 acres, 202 lots, and there are 29 acres of common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| You will see there are multiple areas that are reserved for community benefits and amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| There are walking trails within the development that connect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| There are sidewalks within the development that improve pedestrian access along through the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| In fact, one of the conditions that staff actually asked was that they want there to be more sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5686)|
| 1:34:54| and that is something that is part of staff's recommendation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| which we are in agreement working with them on improving some of the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| I think it's condition number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| The reason there's not pedestrian access to Link Road is of the three roads that this property fronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| Link Road is the smallest and the windiest there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| and there's no sidewalks on Link Road, and Link Road is outside the parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| so there's no requirements for sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| I think what you would gain in having pedestrian access to Link Road is really outweighed by both the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| and the expense and the risk to pedestrians there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| We do have pedestrian access throughout the entire development and onto Harris Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| which is part of the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| Now we're talking about Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| There was a traffic impact analysis that was performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| and there were a number of recommendations as to improvements that need to be done on Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| Those improvements were adopted in two conditions in staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Condition number five talks about implementing the recommendations outlined in the Babley subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| transportation impact analysis prepared by Fulgham McAdoo, revised 221-22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| and as revised and approved by the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| The design details and implementation of the recommendation shall be worked out with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works during the design plan for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| Then after the agenda review on Tuesday, to make it clear what the requirements were for the improvements along Harris Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5790)|
| 1:36:39| they added condition number 13, which states that, and I think this was probably captured by five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| but it was probably a good idea to make it more clear in this additional condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| saying the Harris Road shall be widened to a consistent minimum width of 18 feet in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| right-of-way or utility constraints prevent these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| The developer shall coordinate with Knox County to install suitable operational improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| such as guardrail, signage, stripping, et cetera, to mitigate the additional traffic volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| So there is going to be an improvement onto Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| It's not the improvement that Mr. Murphy is asking for, and he references the major road plan in a way that would imply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5835)|
| 1:37:24| that that major road plan is a prerequisite for development, and it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| The design aspects with 11 feet wide lanes, five feet wide sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| and I think he put a diagram in the record today, that's aspirational for roads in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| If you look at what the major road plan actually requires, it makes that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| It says it's recognized that a particular roadway's character and context of surrounding land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| varies greatly within Knox County from the middle of downtown to large undeveloped tracts of land that are very rural in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| In general, however, the right-of-way widths presented below by functional classification provide for flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| and provide appropriate roadway design elements according to the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| And it goes on to say it is important to note that these cross-sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| such as the cross-section that Mr. Murphy has placed in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| are only examples and not meant to prescribe a specific template for any future road projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| since each road project will need to undergo formal planning and design processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| to determine the specific needs for the given situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| The tool that we have to determine what the context is and the specific needs for the given situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| is a traffic impact analysis that Fulgen McAdoo did today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| that identified what can be done and what should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| Knox County Engineering and Public Works have reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| They've agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| They've placed a condition on it that under these circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| widening it to 18 feet is appropriate to improve the safety of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| in relation to the impact of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| And to the extent it can't be widened, there can be additional mitigating measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| such as stripping, guard railing, striping, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| So staff has reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Engineering and Public Works has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| There's not any competing traffic impact analysis here before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| So with all of that, I would ask that you follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| and approve the concept plan use on review as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| No other comments from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Can I ask the opponent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Yeah, Mr. Murphy to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Because one of the things that he was commenting on definitely caught my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| Because it's on a human scale, it's not on the car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| And it is – can you point out or through the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| can you point out exactly where you're talking about the linkage being to Link Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| the sidewalk that you were commenting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I think on the concept plan, there's two cul-de-sacs that are on the right side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| which is Link Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| So it seems that you could off of one of those cul-de-sacs put a 10-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| or 15-foot pedestrian easement for a sidewalk or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| So somewhere in those cul-de-sacs over to Link Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| So from those cul-de-sacs to access Link Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| and then are you also suggesting that there be a sidewalk on Link Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| No, just to be able to provide access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| If you don't put it in now when it's platted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| then there will never be a pedestrian connection available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| Say that 40 years in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Knox County actually puts sidewalks down Link Road and Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| If you're in one of the subdivisions on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| you have to walk nearly, I'm not going to even guess what the distance is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| but you'd have to walk all the way down to the intersection of Babley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| over to this entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| then back up to access that cul-de-sac in the corner there if you're a pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| I think there's some great examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I think Strong Towns has looked in Orlando where you've got subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| and cul-de-sacs and no road connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| and where you have like two backyards and you have an 11-mile vehicular path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Just that one connection there could at least reduce your pedestrian path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| It seems like a small thing to do that would allow pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| to be able to navigate that area a lot more in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| On that sidewalk connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| it seems to me it's going to be a sidewalk to nowhere, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| So you're out there, so what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6117)|
| 1:42:04| We have them every once in a while, and they just don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| I'm sorry, I don't see the reason to try and connect onto that road with a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6130)|
| 1:42:19| because I don't think they'll ever put a sidewalk down there to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Yeah, Commissioner Phillips, I'd like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Based on the sidewalk comment with Mr. Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Eddie's attesting that we didn't even get a sidewalk out in Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| at a Weigel's and a four-way intersection with a high school sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| The likelihood of this happening is extremely, extremely low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| and then once you get in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| there are not any sidewalks in the subdivision at this particular point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| but they've got sidewalks through that spine section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| and trails and such to connect those other two big roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| So I think they've done more than enough in the internal part of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| so I would like to make that motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| We have a motion by Commissioner Uden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| to approve the alternative design standards one through two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| Second by Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Commissioner Adams, you're licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| Yeah, I just wanted to say that I guess there's also the easement option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| not just building the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| but providing that there's some pedestrian access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| And I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| It feels like that's access to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Because you're accessing something that's completely car-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| not human-scale based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| But if there's never any allowance made for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| there's certainly no chance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| And I think about the – I guess it was online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| There was a reference to these two other residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| that there could be connectivity to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| but right now, because it's all car-scale, there's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| You're going to have to make a much larger loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| And little easements like that, little connection opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| seem like a small ask from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| and lay the groundwork for there being something there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| So I hear what Commissioner Smith is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| like you can't wait for everything to be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| but when there are opportunities to make some small adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| that may be something important for us to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| And I'm not going to say no one else has walked as many miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| around both the city and county that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| but I have walked a lot over four years of campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| And I can tell you that 99% of that, there were no sidewalks available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| Of that time, I might have passed a grand total of a few hundred people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| after 40,000 doors of even meeting people out walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| So I think when you take all of that into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| that's why I'm saying still to this day, 25 years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| after middle and elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| there's still no sidewalks along Tazewell Pike from the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| down to a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| For you to even think that on Babley Road and Harris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| there's going to be sidewalks in 100 years, I think is even stretching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| So by that point, these houses will have fallen down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| They will have torn them down and built something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| So I think we're just taking on a, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I have no problem with sidewalks in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| I think we're making a mountain out of a molehill on this one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| So that's why I think we just need to go ahead and approve it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| because I don't see, having been up in that area for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| most of my life, inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| we don't have sidewalks on even some of our major roads inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| It's not going to happen in the county out in the middle of Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Thanks, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| I'd like to hear from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| their opinion on these couple of potential connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| And I understand the comments from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| but we've spent the last 50 years screwing things up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| to make it unwalkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| and this seems like a pretty small ask to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| You know, at least it gets, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| somebody on a bicycle or a pedestrian somewhere closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| rather than having to go completely out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| So I just, staff, what are your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| On the sidewalk connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| I don't mind giving my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| I don't know if Jim has a different opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| or wants to express an opinion on the connection to Link Road and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| but I guess we didn't really discuss the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| during our staff reviews much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| To the external connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| knowing that Link Road is pretty small right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| I wouldn't want to walk down the edge of Link Road at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| so it really would take some improvements that I wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| to make the connection, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| warranted or even safe for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| But in the future, I totally agree that you never really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| what's going to happen in the future in making connections today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| or at least the ability to have a connection in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| You know, it doesn't hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| and obviously can be a benefit in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| but it really is a, we don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| And I would like to concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| I think it's really important for us to think long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| I know it's easy to look back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| well, we haven't done X, Y, and Z over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| so we're just going to continue that pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| But, you know, the idea of an easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| to be able to allow for that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| is things that we should consider going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| And it is, you know, what this body is charged with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| with planning and thinking 15, 20 years into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| Commissioner Phillips, can I add just a little bit of context to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Typically not, but go ahead, Mr. Bones, quickly, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| It's right in line with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Mr. Gray with Fulgham-McIndoe reminded me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| one of the reasons they didn't have an easement for pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| for those two cul-de-sacs in the link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| is that there's a 10- to 15-foot grade change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| under a pretty short distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| So, I mean, it's still, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I mean, it might make a nice hiking trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| but it wouldn't be good for bicycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| or really very pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| So that was one of the reasons why I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| that they did not consider that in the plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| Thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| All right, we do have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| on the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| to approve those per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| All in favor of that motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| subject to 13 conditions per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| second by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| to approve the concept plan subject to 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| I'm sorry, I was trying to get my light and everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| I would like to add another item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| that would allow for the easements that we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| as one of the items on that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| Madam Attorney, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6575)|
| 1:49:48| May I make a motion to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6588)|
| 1:50:00| Could she negotiate with the motioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| May I make a motion to amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I'm making lots of motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| I think you might be able to talk to the one that made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| and see if they would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| May I amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| I've not been allowed to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| We have to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| Robert's Rules allows for making a motion to amend a motion once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| You can only amend one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| We don't follow Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Our bylaws say we do when it's not in conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| with the bylaws, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| Like with the bylaws, we have to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| Chair, may I speak to Mr. Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| You may speak to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| You want to try to broker a deal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| While they're looking that up, Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| what would be your proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| My proposed amendment would be to allow easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| at the two cul-de-sacs to allow easement access to Link Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| so that we're thinking about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Is there a minimum width easement required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| And here's my problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| I happen to be in the development business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| and I happen to sell lots, and I happen to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| And any time you have an implied easement next to a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| that can be something that would potentially cause PAWS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| to sell that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| And they don't know if somebody's going to be walking through there one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| or what it's going to be or who's going to be going through there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| And, you know, we've been dealing with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| I guess for the last... since I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| they've got a massive budget problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| and they aren't doing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Matter of fact, we took them out of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| because they don't want the requirement to maintain sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| So, I mean, we're repeating ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| about the likelihood of this sidewalk being out there on Link Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| and it just does not make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| And then the fact that the engineer spoke to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| that those are basement lots and the grades don't even work anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| I mean, if this was an infill subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| and we had the infrastructure closed, I wouldn't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| It just doesn't make sense to add an easement on a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| that's rough, that will never have access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| and give an asterisk next to those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| when you've got homeowners that are trying to buy those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| And I just don't think in this particular case it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| And I think, too, that it does allow people to use that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| for whatever reason they want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| And there's no other public access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| So it's going to open up for potential violations of rights of a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| If you've got a person using that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| then they're just out there having fun, drinking beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| going out and doing whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| There's no way to really restrict it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| It's not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| It's not a completed pathway, a pavement or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| It's just potentially also a liability if somebody gets hurt out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| I understand what you're saying, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| and I respect what you're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| But if there was a sidewalk out there or the potential within the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| I'd support the idea of just having it go into nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| and then you have people decide they're going to walk down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| because it's a public easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| and the property owners couldn't stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| I appreciate both your comments, especially Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| My one question is there is a common area that's over by the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| that does access to Link Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| and I kind of thought maybe a compromise might be to add access from that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| to the road, to Link Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| without having to affect any of the individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| So right where the detention area is, the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Because there is a break right there where you're adding access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| from the road to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| I think it's a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| I mean, it's something that all of the residents would have access to regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| I don't know if you need to reserve an easement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| I mean, it's something that, you know, I mean, it is around a detention area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| but, you know, I live next to a detention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| My kid plays in it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| I mean, I think it's something that probably would be a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| So in the future they could have access to that road through that common area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| I don't think we could prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I mean, it is a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| It's reserved open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Mr. Snowden, put you on the spot, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Do you have any comments on this easement that is being requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| And I don't want to speak in favor or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| I just speak just practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| I don't foresee us in many, many years building a sidewalk along Clink Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| And in absence of that connectivity, I think bringing someone to Clink Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| without an adequate path to go to is a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| And in regard to the easement, I think to Mr. Gray's point about the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| if you don't build it when the homes go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| I don't think you can ever build it because of the topography of the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| will practically prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| So even though you have an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| I don't think you can ever grade it in because the homes will be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| in an elevation to prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| So those are my comments and, I guess, suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| Would that easement have to comply with ADA requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Well, it would if it was tied to the sidewalk of Clink Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| and it became, I guess, a transportation component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| If it's more of a recreational component, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Commissioner Adams, you're the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Do you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| Commissioner, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| Could we get some clarity on Robert's rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Robert's rules do not apply to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| You know, I guess if you're opposed to the motion, you can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| And if it fails, if the motion fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| you can come back with another motion and add other additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Article 9 of the bylaws indicate that when a parliamentary matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| is not covered by the bylaws themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| then a simplified rule of order can be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| at the discretion of the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| So there's been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| I think the chair's discretion, as indicated just then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| is appropriate that if you wish to have it reconsidered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| and the movement was not comfortable with a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| then your option would be to vote against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| and then raise a subsequent motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| That would be the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| Everybody comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| Chair will entertain a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| peripheral setback reduction per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| Motion by Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| and peripheral setback reduction per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| Dorie, would you grab Mr. Smith and have him come back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7092)|

| 1:58:50| We have one variance, approved variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| because the utility and drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| is in conflict with the zoning requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| of the Cumberland Avenue, 17th Street District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| and the utility company has no comments on the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| And we do have Stephen Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7153)|
| 1:59:21| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Would you like to defer to any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| I'll briefly go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I understand there may be some questions for Mr. Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| and I'm glad he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| I actually wanted to speak with him about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| other aspects of this development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| As I understand it, you know, the original plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| there was a reserved 10-foot utility easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| However, there are no utilities within those easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| The CU5 zone requires, you know, a 5-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| which is in conflict with the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| and would restrict our ability to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| to the full extent of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| And it's a restricted lot as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| It's relatively small and it has a university tower condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| You know, they have a, there's a cutout right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| So, you know, there's not going to be any utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| that will need to be relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| but even in the event that there would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| we would have to find room for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| either if the utility companies did it within the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| or we would have to find room within our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| So, you know, staff's in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| I understand there's no objection from the utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| and we'd ask that you approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Mr. Cook, come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| I'm Stephen Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| We have a unit at 1700 Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| We also live full-time in Kingsport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| I'm the president of the Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| for University Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| And just to familiarize you with a little bit with the layout there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| it's a 104-unit condominium complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| just north of the property under discussion here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| Our units have mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Some make it a full-time home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Some of the people keep their unit for UT game days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| and special events in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| Yet others rent their unit nightly to visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| or monthly to students or health care professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| who work at the Fort Sanders Medical Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| Many of the units have been extensively remodeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| and property values have skyrocketed lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| In fact, one of our units recently sold for a record price of $185,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| which works out to a little over $400 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| Our occupied levels amount to six stories at Clinch Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| and sit on a two-story parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| This garage is partially fed via a one ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| that is accessed at the street level of our front parking lot at Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| But the garage exit is two stories down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| and is highly dependent on a clear alleyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| that stretches between Clinch to the north and White Avenue to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Also, the city of Knoxville accesses our trash dumpsters via this alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| We also own a 60 feet wide by 100 foot long surface parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| just south of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Our homeowners recently alerted the board, which I'm a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| that a developer was seeking a number of zoning invariances to a lot south of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| the one we're discussing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| In addition to seeking a hardship waiver of eight stories maximum to 14 stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| they were also seeking zero foot property boundary easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| rather than the current five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| So when our board was additionally made aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| that the developer was seeking a zero foot utility easement variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| we were prompted to oppose this because of a potential conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| with our extremely important parking garage exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| and city access to our trash dumpsters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| So in summary, we oppose this variance because it makes little sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| to either us or the independent developer we have consulted with on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| The lot in question is completely landlocked by existing homes and buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| presumably apt at once to move existing utilities to somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| that we do not currently understand where you would move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| We've already talked with a KUB rep that said the property owner making the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| in the utility would have to provide a utility easement on his or her own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7423)|
| 2:03:51| because KUB would certainly not move the utility line to another homeowner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| So in summary, we just do not feel that there's room to move the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| to our side of the alley as our building is against the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| A power transformer is also located very near the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| There's no ability for us to add a utility easement due to the location of our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| and there are already existing utilities within a currently recognized easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| without another place to locate them unless we simply do not understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| how that might be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| Thank you very much for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| Thank you, Mr. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| Any questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| I don't have anything to add, Mr. Christians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| I think all the utilities are already located in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| and this easement wouldn't affect utilities for either property one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| Thank you for the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| The chair will entertain a motion on the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| I'll make a motion we approve variance one because utility and drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| is in conflict with zoning requirements of CU-5 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| and the utility company has no comments on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott-Smith, second by Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| to approve the variance per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| That concludes our meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| Chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220310?start=7533)|
