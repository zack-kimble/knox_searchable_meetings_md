| 0:00:07| And whether or not you turn a petition in or whatever, I mean, you're still, unless you declare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=7)|
| 0:00:11| you're just not going to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=11)|
| 0:00:13| So you're running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=13)|
| 0:00:14| I don't think that's a significant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=14)|
| 0:00:17| If we thought Rick Briggs was compromised in some way, we'd be making an issue of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=17)|
| 0:00:24| Nobody's making an issue of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=24)|
| 0:00:26| Leave it where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=26)|
| 0:00:26| Tony, it's sort of like you'd have to resign from the stormwater committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| I don't question Richard Briggs' ethics or his integrity at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| And I'm pleased that you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| And I think you represent us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| I would just ask that as we go through this process that if you see a hint that there's any issue that perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| it is being used for political purposes or perhaps someone has not recused themselves when they should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| if you would immediately bring that to our attention because we are kind of the overseers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| But I would suggest that you stay on if you feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| I feel comfortable with your being on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| But I also feel comfortable with you being a good watchdog, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| and letting us know if there is something that we need to be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| I'd like to say you tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| If you need a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| In other words, nobody else wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| You're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| If you need a vote of confidence, I'll make the motion that we support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| I move the motion adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part3?start=82)|
