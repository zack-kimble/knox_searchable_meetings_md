| 0:04:50| I'm going to ask the staff some questions right now, Sonja, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Pending final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=294)|

| 0:04:58| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Pending final inspection and security providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| So to review, it looks like the only thing that we're pending on is the certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Health Department and Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Health Department and Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| So I guess next item, the chair will entertain a motion on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I make a motion to approve subject to all the required inspections needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| We have a proper motion from Commissioner Smith with a proper second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| We'll have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| All in favor of this motion, which is properly before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| All of the items that you need to get back to us, I guess the proper motion would be to turn it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| because it's just with the certificate of occupancy, so you're going to need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Can you give her direction on how to turn that stuff in to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| So what I'd recommend, ma'am, after the meeting, meet with Sandra briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| and she'll walk you through exactly how to get her all the information that is still pending on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| The chair, is there any other business before this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| I'm back in my room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| She's retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| This is Sandra's last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| So that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=401)|

| 0:06:50| You don't have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| But I think we owe her a round of apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Not an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| A round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Well, actually, we're sorry you have to deal with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| But, no, how about a round of applause and thank you for all of your hard work on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=419)|
| 0:07:13| Can we hear your ten-minute prepared speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=433)|

| 0:08:26| Moving on to our agenda, our devotional tonight is from Commissioner Randy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I would like to invite Dr. Chad Crawford down to give our opening prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| I met Chad through his son, Logan, who played on the AAU basketball team I coached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Logan was an integral part of the best game I ever coached, or as some people say, the luckiest game I ever coached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| Chad and his family are an incredible family and asset to Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| It's an honor to have you here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Well, thank you, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And I saw on the agenda it says devotional, so like a good pastor, I have a brief two-hour devotional I prepared for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| No, seriously, I thank you, Commissioner Smith, and all that you've done for our community over at Cumberland Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| I appreciate this entire body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Would you invite me as we pray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this opportunity to gather together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| And, God, we recognize that you are the ultimate authority, and you rule and reign over everything in heaven and on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=568)|
| 0:09:38| We also recognize that in your infinite kindness and grace, you have instituted governing authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| And, God, we thank you for this one before us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| We thank you, God, for each one of them and how they work hard as public servants for the common good of our communities and our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| God, I pray that you would be with them not just every time they meet, but specifically tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| God, that you would give them the guidance to make wise decisions for the good of our neighbors and the good of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| And, God, I especially pray for their families, that you would protect them, watch over them, and guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| God, as they steer our community to a greater good to serve you, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| It's in the name of Jesus we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| And tonight's Pledge to Our Nations flag will be led by Commissioner Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Everyone rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=638)|
| 0:10:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| I know we've probably got some folks here tonight who this may be the first time you've attended a county commission meeting or you may be watching online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| This might be the first meeting that you've ever watched, so I want to just do a very brief overview of our meeting processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Knox County Commission has two meetings a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| We meet for a work session on the third Monday of the month and then come together for our formal voting meeting, if you will, on the fourth Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=674)|
| 0:11:24| So tonight's agenda, you'll notice some items have been recommended for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| You'll see some things that have been sent forward to be voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| And then you'll have at one point in the meeting where the clerk's office is going to read a lot of items into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| That is because those items were put on our consent agenda at the meeting last week when we were organizing to get prepared for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| So that's just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| So don't be surprised if you find that we're going to have a handful of items that we're going to debate and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| And then a lot of items that the clerk's office, either under general county business or for our schools, is going to read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| And we'll vote on all of those things with one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| Also, as we go into the meeting, we're always grateful when we have a lot of folks join us who are elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| This is a great venue for communication and we're glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| So first I'd like to recognize my friend, Mayor Glenn Jacobs, who's standing in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| So Mayor Jacobs, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| He also works hard to have all of his reports here at each meeting and we are grateful for that dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| So thank you to his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| I also noticed that Register of Deeds, Mr. Nick McBride, is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| I last saw Nick McBride at the Knox County Pension and Retirement Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| So Nick, you've been getting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Charlie Susano, our circuit court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I see Charlie and every time I see Charlie I have to remind him about Sister Paulinas in our days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And I think you got in more trouble with her than I did back when we were in school together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| And then finally, last and certainly not least, I want to thank our school superintendent, Bob Thomas, for joining us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| So thank you everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Now, moving into the agenda, at the beginning of the meeting we have something called public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| That gives each member of the public a chance to address county commission and your government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| I've got a few people who have contacted us in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I'm going to call out your names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| The way this works, you'll come forward, you'll approach the podium right there, and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| Also, when you approach the podium, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| So with that said, the first person on our public forum is Chris McLean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=818)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Chris McLean, 10140 Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| I'm with AMR Ambulance Service, so when people think of AMR or rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| they're generally thinking about ambulance response or fire trucks coming out of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Another big part of our job, though, is community education, whether it's in the planning or the prevention section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| Really, tonight we just want to recognize a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| The mayor's office, back in May we had a huge event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| It was the World CPR Challenge, and we added a program called Stop the Bleed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| This is really a national program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| It's trying to get more people involved to go out, recognize how to treat someone in cardiac arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| call 911 until trained responders could get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And then with the Stop the Bleed program, unfortunately we have all these mass shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and different incidents around the country, Virginia Beach being one of the most recent ones with a government office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| And we were very fortunate the mayor's office kicked our event off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| A lot of great advertisement, great community partnership, whether it's UT Medical Center helping us do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| We had representatives from the Knox County Health Department assisting in that training, Homeland Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| So it was a huge venture to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| And in May, in one week, we trained over 900 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| So that's exciting. Kudos to the mayor's office for helping us get that kicked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Last week, we actually came here to this facility, trained an additional 100 government employees and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| And that's kind of where we're at tonight is to recognize and say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| And I would ask if the mayor would come down, Mr. Jacobs, because we want to do a small presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| Ms. Jenny Holden out of Homeland Security Office, Mr. Vandeve from Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| we started looking at AMR with them on what we could do in the community to really better something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| And these bleeding control kits, so that's the Stop the Bleed program, is the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| And within these kits, there's tourniquets, there's gauze that you can actually apply to someone that's had a major bleed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| to really hopefully stop that bleeding until we can get trained responders there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| And what we came up with, we at AMR bought eight of these kits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| and they're going to go with all the AEDs throughout the facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| And that's what we want to do tonight is present that to Mayor Jacobs and say thank you for your efforts in supporting this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| These kits obviously won't prevent it, but if it does happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| hopefully they're in the right strategic locations to make a difference until we can get trained responders there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| So thank you again, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I just found out the Velcro sticks to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Does anyone have any questions over the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Good deal. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| Is this a program that is available to businesses, civic groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| How would one request a training direct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| So it is, and like I said, it's really a community partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| So you can request training through UT Medical Center and their outreach program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| You could call us at AMR directly, and we'll get it scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| We went out to civic organizations, rotary clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| We went to churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| We've done Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| When we did that one great week at CPR and stopped to bleed, we were at Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| We were at the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| So really any organization that would like training of this nature, feel free to call us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| and we'll get that scheduled and come out and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| And is there a charge for that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| No, sir. That is free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| And I was really disappointed that I didn't get to attend when you had it here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| So I just wanted to say thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| It's unfortunate that we have to think this way nowadays, but the more we have trained for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| So maybe it's something that we could do once a year with the county and have some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| We can, and AMR has a plan to do it annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| But if you need additional, we can, whether it comes through the mayor's office, public PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| or however, we can come out and do additional training sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I hope we never use any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Me too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| I hope they're a waste of money and they just sit there and collect dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Our next person who's registered for public forum is George Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| George, if you're here, if you could please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1119)|
| 0:18:50| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you, George, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| George Dugan, 7305 Maryland Circle, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| The reading headline of the Knox said, I've got my glasses on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| the headline said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Knox County Commission punts on denouncing threats against LGBTQ community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| How could you punt when people's lives are in danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| and there is someone calling for the rounding up and execution of these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| Do you agree with the person that spouted this hatred attitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| Should there be a Knoxville genocide against gays instead of a Knoxville pride parade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| If not, you have to vote no on any measure like this whenever it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| My partner of 40 years, as of yesterday, and I live in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| and have lived in the same house for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I'm a member of a local church of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| The pastor and I are good friends and I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| he would never speak that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| My pastor said a prayer at my mother's funeral 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| and sang a beautiful song there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| What if I stood before you and stated that I thought all county council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| needed to be rounded up and executed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I would never say that or do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| This is really just a cane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I ask that you vote the way you know is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| George, thank you for joining us and we intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Commissioner Carringer, I notice your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I'm about to turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Okay, alright, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Next person on the agenda is Sherry Raymond from Ancient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| to discuss Ancient Lower Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Sherry, if you could please approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Sherry Raymond and I live at 332 Forestall Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| I think most of us saw the article in the paper today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| and I know this matter is not before the commission yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| but it may well get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I just want the commission to have all of the facts available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| before they start to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Most of the parties involved seem to be blinded by dollar signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| about how much money they think this is going to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| without taking into consideration the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| not only to build this resort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| but the cost in strain on the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| added traffic to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| We're already in a high tourism area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| and adding another quarter million visitors a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| especially headed towards that little area of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| off of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| is going to put a tremendous strain on the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| There are issues with the patent and trademarks that they filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| It looks like it's not going to be approved as of May 14th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| They said that Willow Fork, the application is on hold for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| because there's a prior lower patent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Village is too general to be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| and they are expecting, unless substantial changes are made to the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| and terminology, that the patent will be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Also, he has received several notices from TDEC of violation at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| The incident number is 127809.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| This is at Nixon Road in Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| They've been sending them to Sandra Burdick, which is his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| On 4-25, a complaint was investigated by TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and found unpermitted stream alterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| He has ignored that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| He ignored a May the 8th compliance review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| On June the 6th, it was returned by TDEC as incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| As far back as January, there was sediment and stream disturbance violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I'm not going to try to go over all of this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| The financing that he has lined up is very shaky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| He's had a SEC offering that has raised roughly 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| Ninety percent of that has come from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Less than 10% is from outside investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| so he's got a long way to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| The land that he has claimed that he's going to use for parking trails, buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| and an entrance off of Chapman Highway is within city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| so we're going to fight it there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| As far as the SEC filing goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| use of the proceeds was said to be zero to executives, promoters, and directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Any money that's raised through that cannot go to Boyd or any of his parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| We're hearing all the good stuff, the fancy stuff, and how wonderful this resort would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| and it would be if it was somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| But that particular intersection and the terrain, the wildlife corridor, all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| is just not the appropriate place for something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Please keep that in mind if it does come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| We don't want to rezone that from agriculture to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you for taking the time to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=1490)|

| 0:39:38| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Okay, for our guests who haven't been here, this is the part of the meeting where we finalize tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| Commissioners, please take notes, although most of this is already on the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| We have several items that we will be adding to tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| The add items are to formally add are items 11, 37, 42, 44, 59, and 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2398)|
| 0:40:18| We have our non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| These are items that we will be discussing and voting on specifically tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| Non-consent items are items 2, 3, 5, 34, 42, 43, 51, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, and 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2427)|
| 0:40:56| Also, to confirm, Commissioner Carringer, I think you said item 36 from the Sheriff's Department was to be deferred a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2456)|
| 0:41:06| Yes, they need to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| They have another MOU coming in, so they've asked that we defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Madam Clerk, if you could please note that item, 36, to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Additional, Commissioner Jay, is that your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| All right, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I'd like to request item number 59 to be moved to the front of the agenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Item 59 will be put at the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| We already have a plan on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| All right, good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| All right, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| It's procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Item number 36 is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| We'll have to vote to take that off consent to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| So, 36, page 8, and Commissioner Carringer, that's the one that they wanted to be deferred, which is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2512)|
| 0:42:03| So, we'll need to have a motion, I guess, to pull this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I'll make a motion that we pull it from consent and defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| You can wrap it all in if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Yeah, one set motion to pull from consent and defer for 30 days, that would be the proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| So, I'm going to take that as a motion from you, Commissioner Carringer, with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| All in favor of this proper motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Consider it deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Good catch, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Are there any other additions and subtractions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Okay, seeing none, we'll now move into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| Motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| We do need a motion to set the agenda, so by Commissioner Jay and seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2580)|

| 0:43:07| All right, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| All right, Madam Clerk, if you could read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| This is Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| It's denouncing threats of violence and affirming equal protection rights for all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| With a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Is there any additional discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| I'm really glad to move this to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| I guess there's been some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| George, I want to thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| I think the headline that you referenced in the paper was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| It's been our intent to vote for this, and I'm glad that you're going to be here tonight when we pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| after some minor edits from when it was originally proposed next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| With that said, go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Thank you for being here, George, but I want to read this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| because I have to acknowledge that discrimination comes in many forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| It manifests itself in multiple ways, as we have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| It is in the familiar faces of friends, foes, or coworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| and our refusal to acknowledge, accept, or correct this behavior in our community is part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=2670)|

| 1:07:39| Thank you. My fellow commissioners, what we'll do, I believe we've invited some of the folks who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| nominated to join us at tonight's meeting and I ask Dr. Sillard to send a reminder out to everyone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| afternoon to take a look at their resumes. So what I'd like to do is ask both of the applicants for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| appointment who are here to come forward to the podium and I'll give you up to, you don't have to take all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4076)|
| 1:08:04| but I'll give each of you up to five minutes to state why you think you would be the best appointment to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| particular seat. So if each of you, could I get, who's the first one on our list? I know we've got some, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| two out of the three are here today. I think, is it Linda and Grant, are y'all the two that are here? Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4095)|
| 1:08:29| that's what I thought. Alright, so y'all pick who wants to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4109)|

| 1:08:41| Alright, well thank you all very much for having me here today. I guess I'd just like to start by saying that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| an incredible opportunity for me to be able to serve my community. I'm a South Knoxville resident, have been for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| long time, plan on being for a very long time and air quality impacts our lives every single day. My wife actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| has asthma, my son who is five years old has asthma as well, so it's something that's constantly on our minds. And also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4141)|
| 1:09:15| I think that air quality is as much a social and economic issue as it is an environmental issue around our county and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Especially coming into the summer months, we're going to be getting those air quality warnings and the most vulnerable among us are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4161)|
| 1:09:32| going to be the ones that are harmed by the pollutants and everything out there in the first place. I also think there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| cool things going on around Knoxville that can help with air quality that we typically don't think of. When we think of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| Knoxville Urban Wilderness Corridor and things like that, having plants for that type of remediation and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| thinking about things that we could just do in the city as it's developing. There's a lot of money being thrown around in both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| county and the city budgets right now about development in Knoxville. Some of that could be for more environmental remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| things like that to look at. I've got a good background in environmental science, trained right here at the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| Tennessee, undergraduate in geology, a graduate in environmental science. I've been to a lot of different universities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| so I think I'd be able to help looking at data, coming up with different suggestions and things to be able to look at to help air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| quality here. The big thing is service to community. When it came up, that was kind of the big, I've wanted to get involved for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| long time, making decisions like this and helping out. For this to just be there, it was really exciting for me to be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| I do really hope to go forward in my career being a presence in Knoxville, and this would be a great way to help out everybody that's around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4240)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you all very much for the time. I guess that's what I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| Linda, would you go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4261)|

| 1:11:16| asking me to speak here tonight. Thirty plus years ago, Knoxville adopted me when I came to Knoxville to go to the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4276)|

| 1:11:41| environment, worked at the University of Tennessee, and then worked as a hazardous waste chemist locally, and did some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4301)|
| 1:11:51| and did air and other kinds of analyses for toxic compounds, airborne compounds. And this opportunity is a great chance for me at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4311)|
| 1:12:08| this point in my career to give back to Knox County and Knoxville for all the great years that I've spent here, be able to use my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4328)|
| 1:12:21| expertise to help Knox County make good decisions, serve the community, and just to help to create a healthier environment for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4341)|
| 1:12:38| citizens, and would be pleased to take this opportunity. And I thank you again for allowing me to speak with you tonight, and would be happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4358)|
| 1:12:51| answer any questions that anybody has. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you. What I'd like to do is we'll handle this the way we do it when we're appointing anyone to a committee. I do want to give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| commissioners, if they would like to ask any questions of either of the candidates for this position, that opportunity, then we can proceed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4383)|
| 1:13:13| roll call vote on this for the appointment. First of all, my fellow commissioners, are there any questions that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| Okay, what we'll do is go with a roll call vote, and it would be either Grant or Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4401)|
| 1:13:33| There's a third one, but she's not here tonight, Joan. So, Mr. Law Director, what is the proper, we've got it down to three, so do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| nominate, then vote, and the affirmation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4419)|
| 1:13:52| All three are basically, I think according to your resolution, are nominated, and so then the votes would be by voice vote of who they are choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| out of the three, like you would if you had nominated someone before, and then you go by roll call and say, my vote goes for X, my vote goes for Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4437)|
| 1:14:12| Remember that in your process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| I know that we're going to have to do some roll call, because I won't be able to pick up, I won't be able to hear who won if we do just a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| No, you can't do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Yeah, that's to be clear. So, do we need to have a nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Yeah, if you want to clarify the nomination, this says that they are nominees of the college, but you need to nominate them as commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Okay, alright, yeah. Alright, so they have been put, the names have been put forward by, I guess, Anthony Wise at the Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| So, in order to have a vote, we'll need a motion from the floor to appoint one of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4487)|

| 1:15:12| Because she's not here tonight, but we still need to put her name in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| Okay, so we have all three names are now on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| And the next step would be to have a roll call vote to select who, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4527)|

| 1:19:17| that they thought this was great that you're going forward with this project, but they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| wondered if the city of Knoxville was going to participate as well, or if there was any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| discussions regarding that. Yeah, they actually, we held a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| last week and they were involved in that, and they're going to be one of our partners indirectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| with it. They're not necessarily supporting the project in financial contribution, but they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| providing technical assistance, and oftentimes a lot of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| that may result out of this may be county capital projects and actual policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| that my department uses, so it's fairly fair for them to kind of be a secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| part of it. Thank you, sir. Commissioner, I'm not sure which of y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| chimed in first, but go ahead. Commissioner Daly. Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Yes, sir. We have just got an email about an hour ago that TEMA is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| there's business loans or disaster loans out there. Do you know anything about it yet? I do not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| That's what I thought, so I haven't got a chance to read it, but everyone, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| an email in our group that says that there are disaster loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| now available to help for residence businesses impacted by the flooding, so you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| next month follow up with us and see what that's all about. I'd be glad to. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| All right, thank you. Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| I looked at the 98 flood study we did after the floods at Dutchtown Road, and a lot of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| it said in there, and some of what it said in there, derived around the mouths of these sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Did we implement any of that to help try to keep those sinkholes, the mouths of them, open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| We did not. A lot of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| in regard to private property rights. I think maybe one of the better things to do would possibly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| acquire some of those areas to where we can control it, because oftentimes if they are on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| it's hard for us to control what that individual property owner does. Could the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| of our codes enforcement apply to some of these areas to keep the brush and stuff removed? We sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| That's something that our dirty law ordinance could possibly look into as well. Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Okay, stay there for just a second, Jim. I know just a second ago, Commissioner Schoonmaker, or someone had asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| about the city of Knoxville involved in this, or you had mentioned it too. I was actually in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| that Jim is referencing. For example, we've got certain areas, I was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| more in the Bluegrass Lake area where you had, because of finger annexation, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| an area that was impacted by, equally impacted the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| in a very tight, well-defined area. And it was pleasing, Bart Cary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| pulled together a group just to look at one really specific area in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| of what we may be able to do to prevent these types of flooding in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| It was pleasing to see our engineering team along with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| engineering team, as well as this vendor that I told him at the meeting that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| really believe this contract would be approved at tonight's meeting. But I guess this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| of folks that need to communicate are already beginning to come together and communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| So anyhow, thank you, Jim, if you were able to help pull some of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The same holiday cult is true in the Cedar Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| You have a lot of the road is in the city. I'm wondering how we coordinate our storm drain systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| And if we find elements of their storm drain system that are inadequate, where does that leave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| We can do work within the city. We oftentimes do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| Matter of fact, on Shaw Road, we're improving the drainage infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| So we have good relationships with our civil engineering folks. And if this study does result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| recommendations for that, then we'll work with the city and certainly improve those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Are you saying they work with us when we pay for things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| On the Shaw Road instance, that's exactly correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| Okay, is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| Okay, this item is properly before us. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| All opposed, please say nay. Okay, the ayes have it. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| Resolution 406, approving a contract with Waste Management Incorporated of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| for the provision of waste collection services to be utilized by Knott's County agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Knott's County schools and facilities managed by the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| Motion to approve. Second. Okay, we have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| with a proper second by Commissioner Gill. Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| Okay, seeing none. All in favor of this item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| All opposed, please say nay. Okay, the ayes have it. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| It's Resolution 804, approving Amendment 1 to define services contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| among Knott's County, Tennessee and Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| for services related to the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| Okay, thank you. I know that Barbara Cook wanted to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| so before we have a motion, I know we will implement a five-minute public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| Barbara, if you'd like to approach the podium and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| My name is Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| Good evening. Five minutes is not enough time to list all the reasons why I ask this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5094)|
| 1:25:03| to reject the proposed revised contract for services to be provided by Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| relating to the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| However, certain facts must be presented so that they become a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| I have listened to the excuses given for the failure of the current experimental program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| as well as the proposed plans for the new experiment that will require even more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| This, folks, is just another song and dance from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| One needs to simply go to CCTV and watch the March 2017 public meeting regarding the proposed center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| During this very long session with the stakeholders, it was stated more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| that the program stay would be three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| A 24-hour stay was never proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| Item two, McNabb would have people follow the participants into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| and track them to ensure they stayed connected to other resources, i.e. case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| Number three, it was acknowledged that based on the types of offenses eligible for entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| into the program, the likelihood was that the majority would be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| And four, McNabb provides so many types of services, they have close connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| with other service providers who would be key partners in this experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| Among those key partners was to be the Housing Homeless Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| and local homeless providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| This specifically was included in the grant contract with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| That there is no information as to whether any of those served actually received housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| is perhaps one of the reasons why the state has decided not to provide further funding for this experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| That there is no information beyond the first referral to services is mind-boggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| This isn't the first time McNabb has changed the music to fit the dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| The nearly $1 million they received from the federal government to divert 1,250 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| from entering jail morphed into a recovery and treatment program for prostitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| because they couldn't track the homeless people they encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And surprise, always knew where they could find the prostitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| And no surprise, when the grant money ran out, they went to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| and got money to fund a prostitute liaison staff person so they could keep the program going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| For some unknown reason, Helen Ross McNabb has never been held accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| for failing to meet the objectives of the grants they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| The objectives are not being clearly defined, no one is monitoring them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| or they are the only game in town, so money is no object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| Perhaps you can overlook the wrongful death lawsuit still pending against Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| for the suicide death at the jail in which a McNabb employee played a critical role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| More real dollars out the door as opposed to the cost avoidance savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| so adeptly presented by McNabb as part of their declaration of the experiment's success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| which by the way includes only anecdotal evidence of any real help being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| those they encountered who stayed in the facility which was never at more than 50% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| So McNabb got a building out of it which they can use in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| to make money doing what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| I simply propose that they be told no more experiments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| define for them what specific expectations we have for the existing program as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| and then fund it at the same level as before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| The music has stopped, no new dances, the jig is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| To move forward on this we need a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| We have a motion from Commissioner Daley for approval, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| A second from Commissioner Anders. Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5380)|
| 1:29:54| Hello sir, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| Jerry, please go over the specifics of how this program will work, what is meant by going out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| and how these people will be tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| Are there any reports from you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| We went all last year and never got a single report to commission the funding body, how this program was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| Jerry Vagner, President and CEO of the Helen Ross McNabb Center at 201 West Springdale Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| Commissioner Smith, to answer your questions, the program as designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| will essentially offer two significant components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| We go out into the field and work with people who have mental illness or substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| and treat them in the community where they live and where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| How will you find them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| There are several opportunities for us to engage people in this community who have run into the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Law enforcement is your first line of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| We provide CIT training, Commissioner Daly was at the most recent one where we trained several officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| They know how to work with people with mental illness and substance abuse conditions and they bring them to our facility for care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| At the Urgent Care Center off of Western Avenue where we are currently located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| we will continue to offer on-site drop-off opportunities for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| Number two, we will continue to evaluate people and assess them who have already been incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| and who are going to be released to the community regardless of whether we treat them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| So we believe that treating them will be advantageous to our community to treat them when they're discharged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| So our assessment will happen there, we'll follow them into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| The third element is the justice system and the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| As you well know, you can have mental illness and be in any of the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| and the district attorney can identify people who have mental health conditions who would be better served with treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| as well as a probationary option in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| So those are the three avenues that we would have to follow them into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| Is there not a contract already with the detention facility to do evaluations and treatment there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| I'm aware of that Knox County has with a different organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| They provide treatment inside the facility but not for people who are necessarily being discharged and need a discharge plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| I want to see these people get this help because I know how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| I just want to make sure that we are reaching the people that need to be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| A lot of times politicians like to spend money just to say they've done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I want to make sure that these people that are very vulnerable that have a profound effect on our society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| that we are getting what we need from this, that we are actually able to reach people and change their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| And I would really appreciate it if we could get a little bit more reporting on how this is supposed to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| because it was my understanding that we were going to be seeing 15 to 1800 people under this system the way it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| and we wound up seeing about 450 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And also what came from that report was that most of these people were people that you guys had not had contact with before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| So that makes me wonder if there are people that you haven't been in contact with before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| how will you reach out and find them within the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Certainly and I hope that my answer a minute ago identified how we would meet those people in the community, any of those three avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| To answer your question about reporting, we provide a comprehensive report to the Knox County Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| and the City of Knoxville Mayor at the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Is it a financial report or a report on how cases have gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| It was the summary report that you actually saw and we met with you personally with Commissioner Jacobs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| I got that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| As I was saying before you interrupted me, we had the opportunity to track people over the course of a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| but one of the measures was six months post-treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| So you can't do six months without giving them six months to recover the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| So the reason that it took a year is the first cohort of people would have to be processed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| discharged from our care and then followed for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| So that's why it takes a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| That was designed intentionally by the advisory group that was made up of District Attorney's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| General Allen's office, Sheriff, the Chief of Police and also the Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| So collectively we agreed on that format and we provided that to the Procurement Office of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| who we have a contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| So they're well aware of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| We've been very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| We meet quarterly with that advisory group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| If the Commission wants something different, we can certainly entertain that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| We're happy to provide any and all information that you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| And I believe in your data it showed that the people that had been there six months after their treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| they did not get a reoccurrence back to jail, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| We had a significant improvement in that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Did you check to see if they had been to jail six months prior to the initiation with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| I appreciate that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| We actually looked at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| We looked at charges six months prior to their involvement and six months after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| and took an analytic review of both of those impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| and what those potential cost savings are to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| We looked at both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| And that data came directly from Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| That's not McNabb data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| And what percentage had been in contact with the law department, I mean law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| before they arrived at your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| I don't have that specific data in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| On the amendment to your contract, amending Article I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| it says the agency shall also provide these services at other locations within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| What locations are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| The two locations that I referenced, Knox County Detention Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| we will send staff there to do assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| and also to any of the courts in Knox County who desire an assessment in their courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| And then number two, deleting the article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| what was the difference in the compensation per each agency from the City of Knoxville and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5779)|
| 1:36:27| Yeah. Prior, the two combined was $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| It was $600,000 from the county, $400,000 from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| It was a 25% match of the state's funding prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| The state had provided 75% prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| And just to clarify the record, it was stated moments ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| that the state may have elected not to fund this because of outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| That's entirely inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Their money was one-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| We have a new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| They chose not to fund projects, any project in the state of Tennessee going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| Okay. So Knox County, it's $840,000, and it was previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| $600,000. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| But, you know, I made this observation a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| that we made a budget recommendation on a contract we had already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5839)|
| 1:37:26| We're now amending a contract for services that we did not even fulfill under the past contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| And I'm struggling with understanding the level of services we are providing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5853)|
| 1:37:41| the quarterly review that's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| and how we are meeting the needs of the most vulnerable people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| because we're spending a recommended amount under the budget where we reduced another amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| And this recommendation doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| With regard to your question about whether or not we fulfilled our responsibilities, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| It's under the initial contract because we're making a contract amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| and instilling new components in a contract at a cost that is higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5893)|
| 1:38:21| and we haven't even met the initial requirements under the first contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| And that's where I would disagree respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| We have met all the requirements of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| We've serviced every person who was brought to our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| and serviced them fully within the scope of the contract that we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| The only participants of the program are those brought by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| So we screened every person brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| So if 1,500 was the number, we would have served 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| It was a start-up year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Law enforcement brought 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| That's who we served, and that's who we were prepared to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| So I hope that clarifies Commissioner Gill about servicing the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| With regard to how the program works and the most vulnerable, as Commissioner Smith has referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| this is our area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| We are very passionate and very compassionate about serving this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| We've got the most skilled people in the community to do this work with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| We have great partnerships with all of our law enforcement partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| and our physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers are really, really good at engaging people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| who are difficult to engage in the treatment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| We're going to go to them in the community, wherever they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| and we're going to receive them when they come to us from law enforcement on a go-forward basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| We're actually doing more to engage more people in this new process than was available to us last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Commissioner Jay, your light is back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| I think it had been off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| It was on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| So now that it's back on, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Just thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you for joining us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Do you know about with other centers, both around Tennessee or similar facilities around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| what average sort of maturity time is for a program like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| I mean, in the general business world, you don't ever really know how a business is going to work for three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| You make adjustments every quarter in entrepreneurship, much less in social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| or really any type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| And I wondered if there's any kind of benchmark in which you get through year one and then you learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| Is it a three-year to five-year curve as with other businesses, or does it level out pretty quickly, or is it ever-changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6038)|
| 1:40:46| I wonder if you had any comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Commissioner Jay, I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Nonprofit world, social service sector, no different from any other business, is a three- to five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| We tend to ramp up quicker because the way that things are funded for us, it can be short-term if you can't show results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| So I think that might be one difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| But this project in particular, there was always a concept of a three-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| Let's see if we can make a difference in the first three years, and then we'll evolve and move it to a more successful model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| But I think originally, to your point, was a three-year model that we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| Are there other similar facilities like this around the country that you've been monitoring that are more mature than the one that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Is there any that you can point to an example of what they learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| I know in a very general sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| In Bexar County, Texas, for example, which is one of the programs we modeled after, they're about a decade old, so they're very mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| They're much higher funding sources than our particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6103)|
| 1:41:51| But what they have demonstrated is they've saved, in estimation, about $50 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| because they were proposing new construction for a new jail in their community that never got built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| So they can stand on the fact that they never had to expand capacity for a jail once they introduced this new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| So it didn't necessarily reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| It changed the trajectory for inmate population, and that was significant for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| And they've done a lot of groundbreaking work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| On May 22nd, we received a copy of the one-year report that was provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| I believe you provided it to the county, to the leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| Will it also be a continued annual report, or are there any other reportings more on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6150)|
| 1:42:39| or anything else that might help show metrics going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Or will it truly, because of that lag time of tracking, you really need to stick to an annual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6162)|
| 1:42:49| We're going to continue to track those measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| We'll have to modify some for the community engagement part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| But we can report quarterly because once that first year is under your belt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| that dial, if you will, continues to go by quarter for the six-month cohorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| So that should be no problem on a go-forward basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Okay, so you'll be able to report to this body quarterly or to the leadership that can then forward that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| And my last question is, are you continuously in conversations and working partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| with both our city of Knoxville and our sheriff's office law enforcement on adaptation of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| as well as all of the stakeholders, including the DA, as you learn and the program matures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| We met as recently as a week and a half ago to make sure that the model that we're advancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| everybody's in lockstep on, and then we'll have a rollout plan for all law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| and the district attorney's office as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| This will not be an immediate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| I would want county commission to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Change like this in a system will probably take six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you very much for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| I'm going to move over to Commissioner Schoonmaker, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Commissioner Smith brought up a great point about the recidivism back to Knox County Jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| Because we are a metro area, does your organization track to see if they ended up in the Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| Blount County, or Loudoun County Jails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| We don't currently have access to their databases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| We only have access to Knox County and the city of Knoxville's database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| so we don't have data that goes out in that parameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| And to my understanding, we don't have a centralized database for each one of those that would bring that data together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| But if it was a regional initiative, we would certainly engage all of them to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| but it would take a considerable amount of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| But it's possible that they could have been arrested or incarcerated in one of the neighboring counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Certainly. We would not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Last year this program was, I think the budget was about $2.6 million, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| $2.8 million, operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| $2.8 million, and the number I've heard is 500 people were brought to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| About 80 percent of those were treated, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Okay. What are the numbers you're looking to have delivered to the center this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| I don't have a prediction on that because of the reference we just made about the evolution of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| and where they will bring people and where we will engage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| But we'll have the capacity to see 500 just as we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| Okay. But we'll be doing that with a considerable less amount of budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| In the 24-hour program, if someone is brought there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| could you please walk me through the process and the follow-up process that these patients will receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| So if you were an individual in our community who was identified by law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| as having committed a low-level nonviolent offense, you would be assessed by them in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| and then they would bring you to our Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| You have to have one of nine misdemeanor charges that our district attorney has already pre-approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| for law enforcement to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| So they've already taken out a lot of the risk, if you will, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| It's already been screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| They bring you to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| You enter a locked waiting room where law enforcement waits with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| until our trained clinician can meet you in that lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Then you're brought to an individual assessment room where we spend time with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| assessing your condition, how intoxicated you are, whether or not you are stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| for your mental health condition, such and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| After our assessment, if we believe and you agree that treatment there is better than jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| then we admit you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| So that's kind of the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| If you fail to meet our threshold, for some reason you're more aggressive than we believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| when you entered the program, you didn't have one of those nine misdemeanor charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| or we didn't believe we could provide the proper care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| you're either going to jail or you're going to a higher level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| A number of people that we've treated have had to go to a psychiatric hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| because the Urgent Care Center isn't the right place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| So you could actually go three places after that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| And that's what happened with that other 20% that Commissioner Smith has referenced there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| They went to one of those three places, but they all got assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| We looked at all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| We spent time with each one of them to understand their condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| Once you're admitted, we walk you into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| We orient you to what you're going to experience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| If you're intoxicated, you're going to stay in a single room with basically a recliner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| until you sober up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| It's rather needless and a waste of everybody's resources and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| to try to engage somebody who's inebriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| So once you sober up, we would engage you in talking about what's going on in your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| what is it that's affected you, what charges you committed when you were intoxicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| and what we can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| We try to engage them then in a treatment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| and figure out where they need to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| If you have a mental health condition in that same scenario, we've assessed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| We begin to identify whether or not you're using your medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| if you're even on any medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| and we have a physician or a nurse practitioner see you during your course of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| and maybe it's time to start a medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| As you all know, in order to provide health care, you have to volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| and voluntarily accept that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| So we try to engage people in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| You can stay up to three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| So that first day may be individually in a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and then you might move into a more collaborative bedroom where multiple people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| I'm sorry, Jerry, can I interrupt you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| I think you're describing the program as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| I understood that to be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| No, no, how's it going to be going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| So up until this point, nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| So that same process will happen July 1st as it did on June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| The difference will be once we've assessed you, you would stay for 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| We would develop a discharge plan for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| We would engage you with an appointment when you leave and a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| That case manager is a bachelor's prepared professional in our field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| who will track you into the community, help ensure that you get to your appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| help ensure that other basic needs and benefits that you need could be acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| So they're helping you if you don't have TennCare, if you don't have Social Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| if you don't have benefits, we're going to help you get enrolled if you're eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| We're going to help you get housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| It's been referenced today that we don't really know what we're doing with regard to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| We engage people all the time in the housing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| What the county commission probably appreciates is that's not a readily available asset in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| We have a lack of available housing units, so sometimes that takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| So we engage our homeless service providers to try to get them temporarily housed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| until we can find them a more permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| That will continue on a go-forward basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| The other aspect that we will provide over the course of their care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and it will vary for individuals, everybody's an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| we will follow them intensely with this case management function on a go-forward, that we're limited now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| Right now, past year, we've had two case managers for the 500 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| On a go-forward basis, we'll have six to eight case managers who will be doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| Our ability to do that, by reducing length of stay from 72 hours to 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| reduces all the staff who have to be in that facility 24-7, which is very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| And our field staff will be out in the community doing more case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Okay, so previously it was stated that you tracked them through their first appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| and had a good success rate of people going to their first appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Will you have the case management resources with this reduced budget and the same volume of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| I understand you're going to shift to more case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| Will we be able to follow them further into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| to make sure that they are going to more than that first appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Under this new model where people will actually get what we call assertive community treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| we'll be tracking them and following them on a more intensive basis than we have been able to in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6685)|
| 1:51:32| And so you'll see that and you'll be able to see those contacts kind of go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| Who are the other community partners that you've established and enrolled to help with this after their release?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6696)|
| 1:51:44| I don't want to use the word release, but hospitals use that word, so I guess I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| From the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| So other providers in the community that engage with us in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| So CARM, which is a homeless provider, I think you are aware of them in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| CMC, another homeless provider in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| Cherokee Health Systems for primary health care and mental health care, we refer to them readily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| Peninsula Hospital and Peninsula Outpatient Services would be the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| CAC is a provider of services as well, so we engage them in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| So you can see there's a matrix of providers that we're trying to engage in the service delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| depending on the individual's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Will the case manager stay on with this person even beyond being put in touch with one of these other resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| How long will the case management services be provided to these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| In this new model, yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| They will follow people even if they're engaged in another treatment provider's organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Well, that's going to vary by individual, so I don't want to – it's kind of like last year when we had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| We said, you know, is there going to be three strikes and you're out if somebody comes back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| You can't really kind of box people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Some people will need three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Some people will need nine months of follow-along care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| So we're going to have some variation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| My last question was, Commissioner Smith alluded to your community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| Do you meet with additional community partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| Do you have community members that form a conversation around your housing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| your case management needs, and the critical care needs for the people you're serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| So are you asking collectively, do we gather around this particular population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| This is more on an individual basis as opposed to a collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| Organizational-wise in terms of the level of treatment that you're extending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| So you have housing because you didn't reference anybody regarding housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| Do we have a collective team that meets to look that that is a part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| There's a housing coalition in this community, a homeless and housing coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| We're a member of that for both the youth population as well as the adult population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| And when I say youth, that's 18 to 25, and many of these folks enter into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| One last quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| The decision tree matrix that you described was very helpful, and the list of partners was as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| Is that something you could provide to us in a short PDF of what happens when and if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| decision left, decision right, optional one, two, three, and then the partners that you work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| I'm positive that that information may be on your website, but if you could provide that to us in a PDF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| We could readily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=6877)|

| 2:06:10| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| And I might have one myself for the applicant from any of the Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Steve, my only quick question was, you know, the traffic light there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| it's right in front of Franklin Square as opposed to being on your two access roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| Have you all looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Is there going to be any problems getting access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I know you've got a road to the left and to the right, but I just wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| do you all anticipate anybody cutting through Franklin Square to use that red light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| I believe that, as I understand it, the traffic impact is so low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| that there's no kind of a traffic impact study needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| And what happens is Triplet Road widens out as it leaves this property and goes to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| So there's actually three lanes on Kingston Pike, one for entering, two for leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| So either way, but then if you needed a red light, you can go through the Franklin Square right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| and it's only 200 feet to the red light, and then from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| And I've used both accesses or egresses at different times, so they both work very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7640)|

| 2:07:45| This item 5-E-19-RZ, it's also a request for Steve Maddox for rezoning from RA low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| to PR plan residential at a density up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7671)|

| 2:08:16| development at that density would provide a good transition from the commercial mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| uses along Kingston Pike to the adjacent single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7700)|

| 2:12:25| We almost never see a property going back to agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| and I wondered if you might just tell us a little bit about the plans for your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| We just got married a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| and I used to live in Dandridge on the old Hillcrest Apple Orchard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| and her and her brother and her mother all live together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| and their properties all touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| so I had to move into her house instead of her moving into mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| So I gave her my apple orchard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| So I was wanting to build a barn on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| and plant some apple trees and stuff and start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| Mine was pretty old anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| The trees were about done producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| We have honeybees also we keep on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| Well, we wish you the best of luck, and are happy to support anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| that brings more agriculture into our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Sir, could you fully state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Our clerk's office didn't hear your full name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| Raymond John Fossil III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8005)|

| 2:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| Can I get a motion for approval, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| We got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| We've already got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8014)|

| 2:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Item 4-F-19-RZ is a request of Greg Franklin, John Sevier Joint Venture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential at a density up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8035)|

| 2:14:05| east of Conda Drive, west of Arthur Harmon Road, Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| By a vote of eight to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| the Planning Commission recommended that the County Commission approve plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8057)|

| 2:14:24| acre, subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Those conditions are that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| that no clearing grading of the site shall occur prior to use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| concept plan approval by Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| Two, no access to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| Access only to Conda Drive, meaning all applicable requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| And three, provide a 20-foot landscape screen along the Governor John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8082)|

| 2:14:51| utilizing existing trees and vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| and or install new landscaping so as to be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| recommendations of the type A landscape screening design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| There was significant neighborhood opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| There was concern about density and traffic increase as a result of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8112)|

| 2:15:26| These are the guys from Georgia that we notified to be at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| I even spoke to one of them and said that they had to be at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| That's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| Commissioner Daly, are you representing the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8140)|

| 2:15:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| I'm sorry, I can't hear your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Jerry Diederich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| And Jerry, are you the applicant or representing the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Representative, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8151)|

| 2:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| And is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Sir, could you approach the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| and state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Jim Wright, Jr., 421 Carla Drive, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| I want to confirm, we were talking about item 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| Are you referring to item 68, young man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| Greg Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Greg Franklin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| Greg Franklin's not here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Yeah, you're with the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| I got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Since this was, and maybe Mr. Green, this was deferred for May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| this is his second chance to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| Can we make a motion to deny this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| or do we have to give him the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Was the deferral at the request of the applicant, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| It didn't appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Did not appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Did not appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| So the rules say that this appeal will be considered withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Do I need to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| Now, Daniel, you just said the word appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| This is a request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| This request will be considered withdrawn under your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| And so it would be appropriate for commission to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| and a second and to deem this withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| It being withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| it reverts back to the agricultural zoning that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| Well, in order for it to change zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| there would have to be an action of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| Excuse me, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| but the Planning Commission rules state that if something is withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| a rezoning request is withdrawn, it's treated the same as a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| No new application can be made for one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| to a substantially similar zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| So for the folks here who are in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| it would be the same in our rules and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| the same as a denial, treated the same as a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| I'd like for the Woodfield Park to stand up just to show how these youngsters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| come out in a rainy, cold day or a cold night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| and I appreciate you all coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| So I'll make a motion that item agenda 68, 4F19RZ, be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8295)|
| 2:18:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| So we have a motion for withdrawal from Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| Can we make it that it's withdrawn based on a no-show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| That way we're not listed as withdrawing it as applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| Can you restate your motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| I will make a motion that item 68, 4F19RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| be withdrawn due to the no-show of the applicant for two consecutive months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| The second is okay because the second was Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| So we have the motion from Commissioner Daley with the second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| And Commissioner Smith, before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| I want to check with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| A motion to withdraw moves us back to the agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| which in essence means that we have made no change on this applicant's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| and therefore we would have no legal action against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| in the case of where we have a policy and a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| where we don't change the zoning on anybody's property without their presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| So this would not be changing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| This would be it remaining the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| I just want to make that clear on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| It will stay like that for at least up to one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| It can't apply for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| Well, it does apply for a similar reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| Commissioner Anderson said it can't apply, and then Jim looked curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| He can't apply for a year, so it would be after that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| Or if he sells it, nobody else can apply for a year for this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| For a similar zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| And I might add to Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| Jim Jr., you've done a great job kind of rounding up everybody here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| So I know that he's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| Jim Jr., state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| Jim Wright Jr., 421 Carla Drive, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| Jim, also for my fellow commissioners, you also tell me about the board that we appointed you to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| You are an active community servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Sheriff's Marriott Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Thank you for your services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8445)|

| 2:21:34| and recommended that the County Commission also adopt a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| The site is located within the rural area of the growth policy plan, but is adjacent to the planned growth area and, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8498)|
| 2:21:49| designation is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8509)|

| 2:22:00| I told his partner earlier that he would have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| I think he thought I was kidding when he saw the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| He thought you were what, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| He thought I was maybe not truthful when he saw the people there in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| That's cruel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8534)|

| 2:25:06| By vote 12-2, the Planning Commission recommended denial of the transition zoning for this 2.02-acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8706)|
| 2:25:14| The Commission found that the general intent of the transition zone is to allow development that is located between and compatible with both low-density residential uses and more intense uses such as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8714)|
| 2:25:27| The subject property is not located adjacent to more intense uses and, therefore, does not provide a transition between uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8727)|
| 2:25:35| Commercial zoning to the west is not adjacent and is for a marina, a land use which is typically located in a more rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8735)|
| 2:25:44| The Commission found that the transition zoning could lead to more intense commercial development in an area which is not capable of sustaining that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8744)|
| 2:25:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8754)|

| 2:26:21| I think he sent it to all of us as well as copying the law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| As Chairman and as the County Commissioner for the 4th District, I will make a motion to postpone this for one month until the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8786)|

| 2:27:00| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| We've got a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| The next item is Ordinance O-19-5-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| It's amending the Knox County Code, Appendix A, Zoning, Article 2, Section 2.20, Specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8829)|
| 2:27:17| Terms, 23 Zoning Districts within Article 5, and adding a new Article 4, Section 4.105, Standards for Use on Review Approval of Public Safety Facilities to define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8837)|
| 2:27:29| public safety facilities and permit them in certain zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 2000, I'm sorry, 1990, and this is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8854)|
| 2:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| This is a second reading and it will require a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| Planning Commission question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Is this going to affect anybody's, I know it's just allowing things in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Does this change anybody's potential zoning, kind of like the recode discussion of notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| I'm more aligned on the notification part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| No change in the zoning designation of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| It's just an amendment to the zoning ordinance to identify or to define this use and then to identify it as a permitted use or use on review in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8890)|
| 2:28:20| I just want to make sure we're fulfilling our notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| I don't want to say the dirty five-letter word, but I just want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8907)|

| 2:29:23| because I talked to a lot of very nice people as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=8963)|

| 2:30:03| a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9005)|

| 2:30:19| Do you want to start, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| Just for your committees and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9025)|
| 2:30:26| I'd be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| Criminal Justice Committee was a new committee that was being started and we've already ran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| across two things this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| One, we postponed the night for the indigent care bracelet monitoring, GPS, and also next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9035)|
| 2:30:44| year we'll probably have to start paying for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| Sheriff's Department will no longer have to do that, so that's something that the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| budget will have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| Membership committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| All the counties are members except for maybe four or five, and we're trying to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| those to get those counties members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| And the last one was veterans, and veterans always does really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| It seems like nobody wants to vote against a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| I don't blame them, so that's my updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| And then I'll defer to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| Commissioner Gill, did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| You know, thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, but there's lots to process with the creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| of the statewide charter authorization, the instructional salaries and wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| It's important to note that the BEP funded additional nurse positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| The teacher class size requirement is maintained in certain areas but have increased in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9108)|
| 2:31:55| And I think part of the broader conversation is the impact of the new regulations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9115)|
| 2:32:04| are coming for I guess what we'll say are vouchers that doesn't directly impact Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| County but overall will impact us in terms of the BEP long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| But there are some issues that we'll probably need to look at long term, looking at teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9137)|
| 2:32:24| pay and making sure we address some of the Tennessee Local Education Capital Investment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9144)|
| 2:32:33| But there's lots to process, so this is just a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| And I think on pages 4, 5, and 8 of the legislative conference bill that Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9159)|
| 2:32:49| put out has some real outline of what's about to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| And I was going to reference again last month you did get the printout of the legislative bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| And on the legislative bills there were 616 bills that affected counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9186)|
| 2:33:14| There actually are 388 of the 616 that are still in the hopper for next year where the legislature took no action at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9194)|
| 2:33:25| So again, the Governmental Affairs Committee does a great job of looking at all these bills and seeing how they affect the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9205)|
| 2:33:35| One of the interesting seminars that was available to the commissioners who attended was a cyber security seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9215)|
| 2:33:45| And it was put on by a lady from Albany, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| And interestingly enough, the organization that she represents, we now in Knox County subscribe to their service as a result of the elections in August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9229)|
| 2:34:03| And it's the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| Which when you go online it looks like you're at DEFCON 4 with all the computer terminals and all the lights going and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9247)|
| 2:34:17| And they're also teamed up with the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9257)|
| 2:34:26| It was interesting that in their presentation, some of you may remember that Equifax was hacked and all those millions of people lost that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9266)|
| 2:34:39| Well, this organization actually had sent their members, including Equifax, about seven months prior to that hack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9279)|
| 2:34:47| that here are some of the doors you may need to close in some of your programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| And they apparently didn't read the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| So it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| But this is an amazing organization that runs 24-7 to make sure that counties and cities and the federal government, that outside entities are not being infiltrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9296)|
| 2:35:12| Unfortunately, when they do a seminar, they do mention Knox County and the episode that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9312)|
| 2:35:20| But it's great that our IT department is on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| So our system is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| But that was one of those things where the county mayors and the road superintendents were pretty listening very intently because of the information that was passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9329)|
| 2:35:39| Because, obviously, any time you have a breach of your system, it can reach havoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| So I thought the seminars were extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| Two things quickly that I'll share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| One is this fall we do have the regional conference for that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| So I'd encourage everyone to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| We're going to try to sponsor or just work with Visit Knoxville to make it a really good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| I think the meetings will be taking place over at the History Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| Is that a convention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| So details to follow, but do try to plan on attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| Every time I go to those things, I'll walk away with a good insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| And then another thing, one intangible benefit of attending these is when you talk to other commissioners from other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9380)|
| 2:36:27| And you think about the story and the things that you hear from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| And you hear similar stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| We've often heard from our friends and partners at the school board about our teachers being poached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| And when I spoke with a county commissioner from Anderson County, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9400)|
| 2:36:44| well, gosh, all you guys ever do in Knox County is poach our teachers as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| which was kind of an interesting insight because we've heard it both ways, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9407)|
| 2:36:54| So anyhow, those blocking and tackling things and those intangibles seem to be always good things to take away from those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9414)|
| 2:37:03| Yes, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| I was waiting for announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| I think that concludes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| So I'll wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| And Vivian's shop is doing a great job, but we do have the census coming next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| and they're needing people badly to, you know, you start out like $15.50 an hour for jobs, certain jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| So spread the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| Census needs workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| On to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| I also wanted to comment on what Commissioner Schoonmaker was talking about with cybersecurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| That is a major problem, and the county has been looking into an insurance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| a cyber risk policy that we're very close to getting put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| And a little less known fact is you can have all the security and firewalls and preventions in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9463)|
| 2:37:49| but you cannot keep human error out of the way, and that leads to a lot of these incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9469)|
| 2:37:55| Somebody opens something they shouldn't, goes to a site they shouldn't, and it lets in something that takes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9475)|
| 2:38:02| But on to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| Everybody remember USA Cycling's in town this weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| What a great event for the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| If you haven't been to this, you've got to go see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| It's absolutely fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| Second thing, on July 17th at 10 a.m. at the Norwood Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| there's a ceremony for the renaming of the building in honor of Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| What date? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| 17th at 10 a.m., Norwood Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9508)|
| 2:38:33| Are you going to do a notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190624?start=9516)|
