| 0:13:11| Stephanie Eastman-Bozar, Young-Williams Animal Center, 3201 Division Street. Thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| and I know what Mardi Gras is, and I bet a lot of people know what Mardi Gras is. I thought you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| Could you tell us a little bit about it? Sure. This is our 14th annual Mardi Gras. It is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| signature fundraiser every year. This year we'll be in World's Fair Park on June 26th from 10 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| All right, Sergeant Coward. No record. Mr. Byrd. File is complete. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| Given this organization is near and dear and I had it up, I will abstain from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| All right, we will make note that you're abstaining from this vote. But I will move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| I've got a motion to approve. I've got a second. Any discussion? Hearing none, all in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Any opposed? So moved. Thank you. You're approved. Thank you. All right, that brings us to our addendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| items, and I'll just mention again since we're, you know, progressing forward during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=844)|
| 0:14:14| you know, we're still seeing some delays in some of the inspections. So I would again mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| we can consider 90-day extensions. If the applicants need less time, that's okay. They can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| pick it up before the 90 days. Okay, that being said, Casa Mancha, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=866)|
| 0:14:36| I'm Javier Lopez and we changed the name to Casa Brava. It's on 5640 Clinton Highway. It's a Mexican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| family place. We don't need a little more time. We need an extension, you know, that's all. So you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| need some more time. So you look like you still need building, fire, and health approvals. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Well, I think in two weeks we'll be ready. Two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| If everybody's okay with that. Sir, about how much time do you think you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Two weeks. Two weeks? Yeah. I'm going to call on Attorney Frost. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| what name did you advertise this permit under? We've got Casa Mancha Mexican Restaurant. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| We already submitted the new email that we changed the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| An email to whom? I'm sorry, I didn't. Oh, you didn't get it. Let me see the lady that worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| for us supposed to do it. Sir, there's an issue that the ordinance says that the public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=929)|
| 0:15:38| is made in the name of the applicant. Okay. So Mr. Byrd placed the ad for Casa Mancha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| Okay. Then before I go, should I just get the email then? You guys could be okay with that name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| or could be an issue? Well, we'll have to get back with you on that. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=952)|
| 0:16:02| Mr. Frost, what action should we take on this item given the name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Well, I think it would be fine to allow him additional time. I don't see an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| We might have to come back and do some sort of notice, but I'll look at the ordinance and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| with Mr. Byrd. Okay. Mr. Frost, is this something that's likely to be able to be done in four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=979)|
| 0:16:28| adjusting the name? For the next beer board meeting, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| I don't know. Oh, July 27th, six weeks away. So we probably could. Okay. I'll just get with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=994)|
| 0:16:45| Byrd. Okay. Great. I move to postpone it to the next beer board meeting. Do we want to go 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| or do you want to go 90 days? If he gets it taken care of, I mean, if you give them 90 days and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| get it done, you know, they don't come back. If they get it done in 78 days for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| but if you give them, for example, four weeks, then they'd have to come back another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Okay. You want to try 90 days? They're not getting disadvantaged. Let's do that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| All right. So I've got a motion to extend for 90 days. I'll second. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| Hearing none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? So moved. Okay. 90 days or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| All right. Crafty Bastard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| Yeah. Aaron McLean, 6 Emory Place, 37917. Mr. McLean, you're with us for a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| so get comfortable. All right. Looks like you still need fire approvals on your on-off premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| for 5B. How are you doing with getting that? So we are, I mean, within just a few days. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| submitted our final plans to the city. Basically, everything has been approved. We need to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| couple of handicapped parking spaces and that's basically it. We're getting those striped on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Monday, actually on Saturday, and calling for final inspections on Monday or Tuesday of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| week. You feel like you could get all that done within 90 days? Yes, I would prefer 90 days, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| Okay. No offense, but I would rather not come back. We're here if you need us. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| We'll move to approve pending final documentation. Second. All right. So I've got a, I think I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| a motion to extend for 90 days. I've got a motion to extend for 90 days. Second. I think I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| second. Very good. Any discussion? Hearing none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? So moved. You got 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| Okay. Thank you. All right. Next up is Crafty Bastard. Oh, come back. You got to get comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| All right. This is for your manufacturer distribution at that same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Again, looking at fire, you think 90 days? Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| I'll move that we extend for 90 days. I will second. I've got a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| I've got a second. Any discussion? Hearing none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? So moved. You got 90 days on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| that one. All right. Crafty Bastard. Hey. Give us your name and address again. Well, see the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| said 9937 Kingston Pike. But okay. So the one you were referring to was the, so 5B is the Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Pike. Is that correct? Kingston Pike is this one right now. Okay. 5B is in Delta. Yeah. So my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| and address. So it's Aaron McLean, 9937 Kingston Pike on this one. This is for on off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| Looks like you're missing sales tax registration, building fire and health approvals. How are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| coming along? Yeah. So sorry for the record, if that needs to be changed, I thought we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| referring to the West Knoxville location on the first one. So everything I said on that applies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| to what we're talking about right now. I'm sorry. That's okay. We've got your name. We've got your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| address. We know before. So it's okay. Okay. Okay. Well, sorry. And it's difficult when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| multiple. So the downtown location actually just had the building and the fire done today. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| guess there's fire hadn't contacted me as of 430. Yeah. He sent me a text at 427 saying you sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| it. Okay. Anyway, I'll have to pick that up from, from Mark later this week, but on the Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Pike, it looks like you're missing sales tax building fire and health. So how are you coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| along with that? So, okay. That's what I was referring to earlier. So that's basically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| last thing. So once we get that, then we're going to get health and everything else. I mean, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| idea is to get all of that done within, within the next week. But I will gladly take 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Certainly within 90 days. I will move that we extend for 90 days. Second. I've got a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| to extend. Council Member Ryder. And I just have a question to clarify with Mr. McClain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| since we were confused on the agenda items. Yes. So B as in boy, 5B as in boy, when we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| about Emory place, you were just doing a corporate change restructuring. Yes. Yes. So the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| there was a second, you know, and Mr. Bird can speak to this. We had an ownership change of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| greater than 50%. So you didn't have to add parking spaces. No. Okay. Thank you. I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| to ask a few minutes ago because that was no, everything I was referring to was, was plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| have been submitted and resubmitted and, you know, things, you know, there were no plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| submissions and changes on your existing location. There was absolutely nothing that was required for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| that. In fact, in fact, both inspectors came by today and, you know, didn't get the reports to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Mr. Bird in time, but there was, there was nothing additional required for the existing location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you for clarifying. Thank you for the clarification. All right. I have a motion. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| got a second. Any discussion? Hearing none, all in favor? Aye. Any opposed? All right. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1321)|

| 0:22:22| Kingston Pike. I would assume 90 days would be good for this one as well. That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| All right. Motion to extend for 90 days. Second. I've got a motion. I've got a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1346)|

| 0:22:59| need health approval and the surrender of the previous owner's permit. The permit should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| been surrendered by the previous owners of the business. We have our current manufacturer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| permit in hand. Mr. Byrd, have you received that? I would have to double check. I may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| misinterpreted that. The manufacturer's we have, but I didn't see the on-off. I could have failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| to mark it up. Well, do you think you can get this done within 90 days? Should be the perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| amount of time. Very good. You want to go ahead? I was going to make a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1410)|
| 0:23:40| All right. I've got a motion. I've got a second. Council Member Smith. Thank you, Chair. I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| to abstain on this one. Our firm has worked with this client since the month ago that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| was initiated, so I'll be abstaining on this one. Thank you. We'll make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1427)|

| 0:24:37| do you think we should just postpone it until the next meeting? I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210615?start=1477)|
