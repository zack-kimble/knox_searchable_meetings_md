| 0:00:00| It's 5.30. We'll go ahead and get started. I'm going to call this meeting to order. The Salary and Compensation Studies for General Government and Public Safety Employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| I appreciate a good crowd here this evening. And we'll have the invocation by Councilman Wallace and the pledge by Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=15)|
| 0:00:27| Let's pray. God, all our hearts are heavy with the tragedies that have struck in Knoxville. And we pray for these families affected by this bus crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=27)|
| 0:00:42| We pray for the police and the fire and that they would have wisdom to be able to offer support and courage and counsel at a very difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=42)|
| 0:00:55| We pray for this meeting tonight. We pray for wisdom, that you would breathe in your wisdom into us in this discussion that's before us. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=55)|
| 0:01:08| Face the flag, please. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=68)|
| 0:01:24| Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please. Mayor Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman Dela Bope. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=84)|
| 0:01:34| Councilman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis. Here. Councilman Saunders. Absent without leave. Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=94)|
| 0:01:47| All right. We've got just about everybody here. And Madam Mayor, would you like to have any comments before we begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=107)|
| 0:02:09| I was going to say that. I didn't have the guts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Is this plugged in? Okay. Thank you, Council, for holding this workshop. And thanks to all the folks that are here, all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| What we would like to do today is really present two things. First is to ask Mr. Elliot Sessels from Segal Waters Consulting to present the findings of the compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=140)|
| 0:02:33| You all know that we actually budgeted for this, not in the current year budget, but in the prior year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| And because of the timing on it, by the time we had to start on our budget for the current year, these results weren't back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| And so we want to present these to you. And we've asked Mr. Sessels to take no more than 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| This is something that could take several hours if we got really into all the detail. But he's going to hit the highlights on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| And then we're going to have Vicki Hatfield come up and talk to you about the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| We've studied this. We've looked at the results. We've met with our employee representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Our team has looked at it, looked at our budget. And we've got recommendations to bring to you tonight on how to begin to address the discrepancies that have shown up as a result of this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=191)|
| 0:03:22| And it will be our intention to bring these recommendations to you for a vote in January for a February 1st starting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=202)|
| 0:03:33| And so I'm just going to lay that all out today so you know what to expect over the next hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And so if it's okay with counsel, unless you have questions for me, we'll call on Mr. Sessels to begin telling you the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| Thank you, Mayor. And if we could, just for consistency in the flow of the meeting, we'll let him begin and do his 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| Write your questions down. And at the end, we'll let him answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| And then the same for Ms. Hatfield or whomever wants to respond from the city if that appeases the counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| I think that's the best way to do it. So with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| Good evening and thank you for this opportunity and thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| My name is Elliot Sessels. I'm Senior Vice President and National Practice Leader for Siegel Waters Consulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| We're part of the Siegel Company and National Human Resources Consultancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| Let me just say by introduction without taking up too much time that prior to my 23 years with the firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| my prior career has been in the public sector, in the areas of public finance and human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| So as I bring these results to you, and I think there's some good news here, that I bring it through the prism of understanding the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=283)|
| 0:04:55| the fiscal concerns and other concerns that this city and, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| as other cities that I represent across the country have faced and continue to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| And again, I appreciate any questions that you may have as I try to get through this in a half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| Be mindful of that. In the spirit of that, the presentation really has four components to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| One is the methodology. What is it that we were asked to do and how did we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| And then what our findings are with respect to the general employee group and then with police and firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| The methodology that we've employed is consistent across all three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=334)|
| 0:05:42| And the first thing I want to point out is that this is a total compensation study so that what we were examining was the competitiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| certainly of pay, of the pay ranges that the city attributes to each of its jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| but also taking into consideration the costs that the city bears for benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| whether those are health benefits, health and welfare related benefits, or retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| Because one of the things that we know as we do this around the country is that depending upon where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and depending upon some historical facts that there may be some balancing that occurs between both pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| and the cost of benefits that are provided by public sector employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Now, without getting overly technical, I just want to point out that what we are examining on the pay side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| is examining the pay ranges, the minimums and maximums attributable to each job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| but that we pick the midpoint of the pay range for the purposes of adding together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| if you will, the layers of the cake that comprise total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| So we start with the midpoint of the pay ranges and the competitiveness of that compared to the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| And we add to that the employer cost of health benefits, which include medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| And to make sure that we are comparing apples to apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| we examine those costs and those cost structures based upon the city's enrollment distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| meaning how many people are in each tier of coverage, single, family, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| So we compare that distribution to what those costs would be at the various cities holding that constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| The other thing that we take into consideration with regard to the retirement side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| is what we call the normal cost of the defined benefit retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| And the normal cost of a plan is very simply how much do you have to put into the bank, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| today over an employee's career to fund the stream of benefits at normal retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| We recognize that the city's contribution to the plans is more than the normal cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| but those unfunded liabilities vary from one city to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| So the piece that's constant that you can measure attributable to the value of the benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| to the cost of the benefit, is the normal cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| So we add the midpoint of the pay range, the health benefits standardized by the city's enrollment distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| and the normal cost of the defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| And to the extent that any employers have in addition defined contribution plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| we add that too, and that's usually a percent of pay just as are the normal costs for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| I should say that the difference between health benefits and retirement benefits is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| health benefits are a fixed dollar cost, whereas retirement benefits tend to be a percentage of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| So you'll see as we go through this, they have different implications when we do total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| To just drill down a little bit, as I said, we did a general employee study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| and we did a public safety study, a public safety study broken out between police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| For the general employees, we gathered data from 49 public employers, 38 cities, 15 in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=545)|
| 0:09:14| and 23 in contiguous states, and 11 counties, 4 in Tennessee, and 7 also in contiguous states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| The choice of these employers really is drawn from those employers that the city has regularly surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=563)|
| 0:09:33| and that in fact respond to surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Obviously not all employers are going to respond to surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| And also were bounded by some considerations of population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| So just typically a question that we get is why did you select the cities that you selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I thought I'd try to make that clear up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| In addition for those job titles, and this relates to general employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| where you would find analogous jobs in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| we drew from three published data sources there up there on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| to get a sense of how the private sector compensates from a pay basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| There were a total of 76 benchmark job titles covering general employee functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| They tend to be representative of all the functions of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| What we in HR refer to as the job families, groupings of jobs that are similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| On the public safety side, there was a kind of tighter, smaller definition of the labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| As you can see here, it included 18 cities, 6 in Tennessee, 12 in the bordering states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| The public safety survey covered all 10 police ranks and all 8 fire ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| And we'll go through that as we proceed with the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Now when we collect information from other employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| obviously those other employers' work weeks may differ from that of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| In addition to that, so in this next slide, Knoxville, as you know, has a 37.5-hour work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| Many of the surveyed employers have a 40-hour work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| So what we want to do is put that on an apples-to-apples basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| So we actually adjust the pay rates for cities where people work 40 hours by 6.25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| to get it down to the same 37.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Otherwise, you would look like you were over, that everybody else was paying a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| than the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And the 6.25% is just simply the difference between the 40 hours and the 37.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| So that's one adjustment that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Another adjustment that we take into consideration is that as we look at these various cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| and counties in the universe of peer employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| that there are differences in what we call the cost of labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| So that to just compare dollars to dollars without taking into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| those geographic differences would be, in our view, inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| So this slide has a lot of numbers on it, and it represents, so you see here the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| of all the peer employers that were in the general employee study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| But what's important to understand is if you see a negative number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| it means that the cost of labor in that city was higher than it is here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| So you reduce that to put it on an apples-to-apples basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Conversely, if the number is a positive number, it means that the cost of labor in that city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| is lower than it is here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| So you adjust those upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| Again, the objective here is between these two adjustments is to, as best as one can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| put this on a consistent basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| On the public safety side, we have a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| On police, 10 peer employers all have the same annual work hours as Knoxville police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| Eight peer employers have longer work schedules, so we reduce those pay rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| similarly to a consistent work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| On the fire side, 11 peer employers have the same annual work hours as Knoxville police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| of 2,920 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Seven peer employers have a shorter work schedule, so because of that, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| we increased the pay rates to reflect a consistent definition of work year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| In a similar vein to the general employees, these were the geographic adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| for the peer employers that we used in the public safety survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| You'd find these cities on that prior slide, and the numerical values for the adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| are obviously the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| So that's the overall methodology that we employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Gathering the pay information, gathering the cost of health benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| gathering the cost of retirement benefits, and then for the pay benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| just to reiterate, making sure that we were using a consistent work week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| or work year definition as well as adjusting for any geographic differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| from one city to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So what I'd like to do with that said is to take you through our general findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| for the general employee group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And I have to say the good news that I'm here to bring you is that overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| the general employee group is market competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| Let me tell you what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| So we gather information for those 76 benchmark jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| and we look at them both individually and then we aggregate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| And this slide is, if you will, the most aggregated perspective of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| And we look at pay range information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| So I want to be clear, we're not looking at what people get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| We're looking at the structure, and we're comparing your structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| for a particular job title to these other peer employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| We looked at this at two points, looking just at the public sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| and then looking at the private sector, as you can see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| And what we show you is city of Knoxville's pay ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| as a percent of the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| So we look at what's the average of pay at the minimum of the pay range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| at the midpoint, the middle of the pay range, and at the maximum of the pay range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| across all the data that we have collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| And I think you've seen the report, and you know how dense it is in terms of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| What's important here is that, as I said, the city for general employees overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| now there is some variation on a job title to job title basis, is market competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Our definition of market competitiveness is if you are between 95 and 105 percent of the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| What's interesting about this data, and it doesn't always work out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| because frequently I'm asked, you know, is the public sector different than the private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Does one pay more? Does one pay less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| For those jobs that are in the city that have analogous jobs in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| what you see here, and we'll be focusing at the midpoint of the pay range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| the market position is identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| So whether you're looking at other public employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| or you're looking at the private sector across all these 76 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| the city's market position is the same, and it is within our corridor of 95 to 105 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| So we think things overall are great when it comes to general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| My understanding is that another perspective that you may be used to looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| is at what percentile these pay ranges are compared to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| So we took this market data where we look at it compared to the average and just gave you a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| So as you can see from this slide, the city's rank is basically in the mid-60 percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| of the distribution of data that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| And this is for the public sector market, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Another way to look at it, since sometimes pictures are a lot easier than words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| is this bar chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| This is base pay only, and you'll see that there are three segments to this chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| The left is public sector, the middle is private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and the far right is both of them combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| This is just a pictorial representation of the data that was in the other table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Again, what you see in the midpoint, the middle bar in each set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| is that the city is at 103 percent of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Again, overall, general employees across all benchmark jobs within our corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| and you see the competitive range there between 95 and 105 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| We did the same thing here on a percentile basis just to represent consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| Again, this is public sector data only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Now, I said that overall for general employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| that pay is market competitive within that 95 and 105 percent corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| We have 76 benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I'm not going to take up everybody's time tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| to go through this on a benchmark by benchmark basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| but I think it's illustrative for us to spend a few minutes on just one job title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| so you understand what the data means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| And so this chart, and there are many slides to this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| gives you the layers of the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| It shows your competitiveness for base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| so that's the first column after the job title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Then it talks about employer cost of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and within that major heading there's two columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| the weighted total health benefit costs and the retirement benefit costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| and then the far right column is the employer total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| It's simply the sum of those components of total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| If we just look for the moment at animal control officer senior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| just because it's the first one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| but the structure of this is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| within each job title you will see two rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| The first row will be Knoxville and Knoxville's base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| midpoint of the pay range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Knoxville's weighted total cost for health benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| medical, prescription, drug, dental, and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Knoxville's retirement benefits, and then the sum of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| The second row will be the market study average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| so if we take all the data that we've received for animal control officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| where folks have a similar job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| that's the average of the market data at the pay range midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| The weighted total cost of health benefits is a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| that where we apply your employee distribution to health benefit enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| to the cost structure of those other employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| and then the next column over would be the market average contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| for retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Sum those and you get the far right column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| The row beneath that is instructive in that it shows Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| for each of these components and for the total compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| as a percent of the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| So just simple math on base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| that 99% is the 33,017 for Knoxville's pay range midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| for animal control officer senior compared to the market average of 33,489.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| Very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| And the math there applies to each of the columns for health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| for retirement, and for employer total costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Just to reiterate, and if you were to scroll down this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| the relationships on the health side stay the same no matter what the job title is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| because health benefit costs are a fixed dollar cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| They do not vary with pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| But the retirement costs do because retirement costs are reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| as a percentage of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| That's how they're valued from an actuarial standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| and so those retirement costs do vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| So what you will see, and even on this first slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| is even though that I said overall that pay is market competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| you'll see by example, and again I'm not going to go through all the slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| but I think it's instructive here that the first two jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| the animal control officer and the animal control supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| are right at market, but going further down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| the crime analyst and the crime scene technician are below market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| So there are pluses and minuses here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| but overwhelmingly over the 76 benchmarks, the city is at market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| So just as you at your leisure take the time to go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| and again I'm not going to stop at every slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| but as I scroll through them quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| if you look at base pay percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| they do vary on a job title by job title basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| but overall most of them reflect that the city is market competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| And if you do look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| just to note that if you're wondering how these are organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| they're organized by what we call job families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| so similar groups or similar functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| So you'll see them related to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| and the job family headings are on top of each section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| So I'm going to kind of quickly go through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| because this is an awful lot of data and be mindful of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I'm happy to take particular questions at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| on any of these or the methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| What I'd like to do is just talk to you a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| not the dollar cost of health benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| but something that we examined in the data we collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| which was what portion of the total cost of health benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| do other employers pay compared to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So this is what we talk about in terms of cost sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And this slide shows you for the various city of Knoxville plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| what the city pays as a percentage of the total cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| for single and family coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| and compares that to the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So we collected this similar information from the peer employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| And in fact, although there is some slight variation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| depending upon city plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| that overall in fact the city's contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| as a percentage of the total cost for health benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| is right on the money in terms of what the market shows us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| So I think that's another good piece of news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| With regard to retirement plan contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| the retirement plan contributions come in two flavors, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| There's the defined benefit retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and defined contribution or deferred contribution plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| that other employers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| The city of Knoxville doesn't have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| but we'd be mindful of gathering total cost information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| We had to gather that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| So the city of Knoxville, this is the normal cost basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| not the city's total contribution cost, is 8.09%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| As I said, the city doesn't have a contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| to any defined contribution or deferred compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| But in the marketplace, we see average normal cost at 10.32%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| and an additional 3.25% of pay being contributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| to these other form of defined contribution plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| for a total of 13.57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Now the only takeaway from this is that these are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and quite frankly this is true on the health side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| that these are costs that other employers are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| But neither on the health side nor here do we take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| what we call the plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| So how rich the health benefits are in terms of deductibles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| co-pays and such from one plan to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Nor do we take into account here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| other than the employer cost of these retirement plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| whether a retirement plan in terms of a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| is richer or less rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| So I just want to be very clear as to what these numbers mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| These numbers are pure costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| and having been a former budget person in the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| obviously one of the concerns is what are we paying in total dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| by job title or for the entire workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| compared to what our peers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| The prior slides gave you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| But I wanted to share with you what's behind, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| the black box of how these numbers are derived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| If I can move on now to the police section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| what we find on police is not the same picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| that we find for general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| And these slides are similar in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So we looked at the 10 police ranks in aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| and we compared them to the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| What we find is that at the minimum of the pay range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| pay is at 91% of market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| the midpoint is 88% of market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| and the maximum is 86% of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Remember, and it's on there on the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| that our corridor for market competitiveness is between 95% and 105% of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Same corridor we did for general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| If you look at this on a percentile rank basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| at the minimum you're at almost the 47th percentile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| at the midpoint the 40th percentile of the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| at the maximum about the 37th percentile of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| So the percentile ranking mirrors what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| on our typical approach of looking at where you stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| on average of the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Now I said there were 10 ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| and the next slide is similar construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| to what I just showed you for general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| What you will notice here is that the job titles that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| are called police level A, B, C, D, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And the reason we did this is when we provide the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| for other people to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| whether it's the general employees or police or fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| we provide a summary with respect to the general duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| and responsibilities of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| But we don't want people, and this particularly happens in police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| where rank structures in one city may have a different connotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| than rank structures in another city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| So we asked employers not to match on job title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| but to match on those duties and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| And the way to get away from the automatic response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| of a sergeant is a sergeant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| is to kind of code it at levels A, B, C, D, and E, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| and then to provide, as we did in the actual survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| a kind of description of duties without leading the witness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| so to speak, that this is a sergeant or a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| But for the purposes of this slide and for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| the parenthetical relates to actually the job title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| here at the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| although we didn't disclose that in the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| because we did not want matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| What you'll see, quite candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| is that on the base pay perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| that all of these ranks, with the exception of recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| but all of these ranks are somewhere in the mid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| to high 80% of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| So I'll go through this, and this is on two slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| And the market position, whether on a base pay basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| or on a total compensation basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| is pretty consistent in terms of position below that 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| to 105% card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| So since we're only dealing with 10 ranks here in two slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| on the first slide you can see these in mid-80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| If we go to the next slide, which gets you to the higher ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| maybe they're in the higher 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| but still significantly below a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Again, on the bottom of the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| you'll see overall the same data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| where pay overall across the 10 ranks is at 88% of market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| and on a total compensation basis, 86% of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Again, we looked at cost sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| because sometimes benefit plans for public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| may have some slight differences in terms of cost sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| and other nuances than general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So we have the same comparison here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| And again, from a cost sharing perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| whether we're talking about police in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| the city is right at market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| in terms of the portion of total costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| that it absorbs either for single coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| or family coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| On the retirement side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| we know that public safety folks typically have a different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| or in many cases have a different retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| than general employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| so these numbers look significantly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| in terms of costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| City of Knoxville, the employer normal cost of 17.91%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| plus a contribution of $260 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| on the defined contribution side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| compares to the market average of 17.21% normal cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| and a 3% contribution, 3% of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| to defined contribution benefit for a total of 20.21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| But then again, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| these are cost bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| They're not looking at perhaps differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| in the benefit design, the value of those benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| With regard to FHIR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| we looked at eight FHIR ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And again, the slide should now be pretty familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| The situation on FHIR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| is 91% of the market average at the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| 87% of the market average at the midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| and 84% at the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So similarly, across the eight FHIR ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| the city is below our competitive range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| And if you're used to seeing this on a percentile basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| you're at about the 50th percentile at the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| so slightly better at entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| 39th percentile at midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| and 36th percentile at maximum of the pay range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| So this kind of mirrors the prior slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Again, this is now on a rank-by-rank basis for FHIR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| and we use the same approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| of calling these FHIR level A, B, C, D, and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| because of differences in job matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| that what folks may call a sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| may be different, to use my example again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| What you see here is base pay for recruits is at market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| On this slide, again, we're looking at pay competitiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| at the midpoint of the pay range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| in the mid to upper 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and as you go up the rank structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| you're then at the upper 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Overall for pay, the bottom row of this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| again, 87% across the eight ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| and interestingly, on a total comp basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| it just turned out this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| that it's also 87% of market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| taking into consideration the benefit costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Again, looking at premium cost sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| you're right on the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| in terms of the share of total health costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| health benefit costs that the city is paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| both the single and family tiers of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| so there's no issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| and a similar situation that we saw in police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| your employer contribution is 17.91%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| plus the $260 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| compared to 18.73% market average normal cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| For fire, the contribution rate in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| for a defined contribution form of benefit is 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| You may recall in police, I think it was 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| so it's lower here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Total of 19.73%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| again, relatively close to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| So that's a lot of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| but tried to keep within my time allotment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and I'm happy to take questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you for the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| It's quite a lot of helpful information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I guess my first, I guess two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| My first question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| in the total compensation, was longevity pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| part of total compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| No, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| what was in these calculations, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| What was in these calculations was base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| health benefit costs, and retirement costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| So we know that there may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| to what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| pay supplements, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| but those were not considered in this comparison that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| The other question I had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| on the normal cost of the defined benefit plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| how did you get the information from the other participant cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| and do you feel like it was accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| And I guess the reason why I'm asking that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| like, just reviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| and this is from, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| it's from the more lengthy report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| The city of Chattanooga reported 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| The city of Memphis reported 32.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Newport News reported 36%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Richmond is 37% as their normal cost of their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| Do you feel like those are accurate numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Well, let me tell you the process, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| The process was that we distributed this fairly lengthy survey document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| to the peer employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| and they provided us with responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| or most of the cases they provided us with responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| But this was also supplemented in many cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| with looking at the actual actuarial valuations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| to derive the numbers that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| So this is, quite candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| the best effort of both getting information from the primary source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| namely the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| as well as trying to validate it where the actuarial valuations were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| that we were actually using normal costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| And I can tell you along the way that there were questions raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| both as we did review with the city and amongst ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| as to whether people were actually interpreting this in the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, it's difficult to believe that these cities would create a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| that would, you know, be so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| And it also seems somewhat reflective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| close to what our actual costs for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| are for our pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| So I'm just concerned if we're comparing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Are we really comparing apples to apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| when we look at these numbers regarding the pension costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| All I can say to the council is that the numbers that we've gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| are the best effort we can get from both getting the survey response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| from the cities themselves, having conversations with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and then trying to validate with actuarial valuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| And I guess my last question is, when you're doing the aggregate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| do you take into consideration sort of the number of employees in each category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| So, for example, in police, there's a lot fewer deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| than there are police officers or police A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Yeah, I think I understand your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| but if my answer isn't to it, please clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| We're looking not at actual pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| So I want to be very clear to everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| This is simply a study of, for every rank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| since you're talking about public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| every rank there is a pay range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| every employer has a pay range, minimum to maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| People progress through the pay range in a variety of ways in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| And so we're not looking at what the actual pay is of a sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| or a police officer for, we're simply saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| if you look at the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| what does the city structure look like for that job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| versus the similar structures in the peer employers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| So if your question is, do we look at the mix of actual pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| the answer is no, but that wasn't the focus of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Right, and then when you average all the different class of types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| you don't take into account the number of different employees in each group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| It's just simply the average of those 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Of the pay ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| How do you take into account or how do you compare Knoxville with other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| in terms of vacation time, sick leave, holidays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Are we comparable or do we give more, for instance, vacation time or sick time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| How is that tied into as far as benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| It's not considered in these calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| So the point is we're looking at pure, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| budgetary dollar costs in this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| And the only thing, I shouldn't say the only thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| but in my opening remarks we're obviously standardizing it for differences in work year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| or work week definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| but not taking into consideration differences that may occur in terms of pay time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| I don't see any further lights, so I'm going to assume there's no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2406)|
| 0:40:19| Yeah, well, I thought we would do, you know, if you have further questions of Mr. Cecil's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Yeah, we'll have questions for Ms. Hatfield as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| So, okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| And my staff is going to bring you guys a copy of what I'm about to try to walk you through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| and I will apologize because I'm not always the best at explaining things the way that they work in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| So I'm going to take you just through these recommendations literally point by point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| And if you have any questions or if I lose you at any point, just please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| And I've divided the recommendations by pay structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| so we're going to take each pay group separately since they all have their own compensation structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| I'm just going to go through the recommendations for police, then for fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| and then for general government based on the data that Mr. Cecil's just presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| So in working with Jim and with the mayor in trying to look at this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| and then come to you with recommendations of what we think should be done as a result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| for police, after looking at the data, what you see here on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| I kind of repeated the chart here from Elliott's data just to show you for each rank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| sort of what that market position looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And my recommendation at this point is to basically take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| If you remember in the detailed data pages you have for police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| where it has actually those average salaries on those charts, the number that I used is base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| I did not use total comp in these adjustments and these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| because as you kind of just heard Mr. Cecil's explain, it's very hard to arrive at total comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| There are a lot of things we can't roll into that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So when we're looking at pay structures, we need to just focus on base pay to base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| So I used the number that's in your data sheets that are in Mr. Cecil's presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| that first column where it says base pay for each rank, and then it has that market study average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| So that is that midpoint that Mr. Cecil's found for each rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| That is that magic number that should reflect the midpoint for that rank's pay range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| So that would be the number that I used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| My recommendation for each rank in police is to go to 95% of that market average for our midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2573)|
| 0:43:03| So basically take the survey midpoint and achieve 95% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| As Mr. Cecil said, 95% to 105% is considered competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Why am I recommending 95% and not recommending 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| One reason, because 95% is still considered competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and I want to be sensitive to our budget constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| While 100% may be ideal, it may not be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| I feel like 95% is a more manageable figure that I think that we can work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| while it still gets us to a market rate that we find acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And this is, you know, we did the survey differently this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| This is different methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| It's a different participant group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| It's smaller than the group we typically have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| so this data is different than the data we usually get from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| So it is my preference to make a more conservative movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| because this is data that we have for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| and it is similar and fairly consistent with data we've been collecting since Mercer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| so for the last six years, but it's not identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| So my preference is to make a conservative movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| because that gives you the opportunity, as we do our survey every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| which actually we're already in the middle of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| So we'll actually have another survey with new data in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| So, you know, adopting 95% gives us that opportunity to take another look very soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| and see if we feel like there are any additional adjustments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| So that's why I'm recommending 95% as opposed to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| So if you flip the page, what you're going to see is the current structure for police on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| and my recommendation on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and essentially what I've done is I've taken that survey midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| I've adjusted it to 95% of the survey midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and then I've used our standard formulas to build the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| The ranges have set widths without going into a lot of unnecessary detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| They're around 35% at the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| They grow to about 40% at the top end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| So I built each range from that 95% midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| So this shows you what the change in the structure would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| if we adjusted it up to reflect that 95% figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| The initial cost of doing this, to just change the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| not identifying individuals within the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| just the change to the structure does require that we raise any individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| that's current salary is below the new minimum that we set if we raise the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| The cost to do that alone would be about $86,000 to raise those minimums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| to reflect this new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| The second piece of my recommendation for police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| so, you know, as Mr. Sussels described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| his survey identified data relative to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| So this first recommendation is how do we adjust our structure to match the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| That still leaves the question of what do our employees' actual salaries look like within that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| So to do that, I used the same model that we used when we did the Mercer implementations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| because we've used it before, we understand it, it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| So using that same model, which I don't know if any of you were here then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| basically what Mercer did, the model that we adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| was saying that our expectation is that an employee would reach their midpoint of their pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| within 10 years of entering their job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| So essentially what you do to simplify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| you take the difference between the minimum and the midpoint, you divide it by 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| and for every year, full year in the job class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| the employee would move up another increment toward that midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| So I looked at police and I placed each employee into this new structure based on that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| If I have four years, I should be at the four-year mark within my rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| If I have six years, I should be at the six-year mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| To raise any individuals in police to that point relative to this new structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| would give increases to 134 of the 409 officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| and the cost of doing that would be about $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| So that would be the second part of my recommendation for police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| So the total cost there for police would be a little over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| The first piece, you know, recognize the first piece is a change to the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| and then the second piece would actually be adjusting our employees into that structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| using the model that we adopted back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| Basically it's the same recommendation for fire, just different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| I've repeated Elliott's data here for fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| and the structure results were fairly comparable for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| So again, I've recommended taking that survey midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| adjusting our midpoints to reflect 95% of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| and then rebuild the ranges based on our standard range widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| So here you see the current fire structure on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| and then the recommended fire structure on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| and that would be reflecting that 95% of market as our midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| To change the structure, again, we have to raise any individuals that fall below a new minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Just the cost to change the structure and raise those individuals below a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| the cost would be a little over $134,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| The second piece, again, is to take that 10-year to midpoint model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| look at each employee relative to this new structure and see what their position would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| and you'll see there's a big difference in fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| Most of our firefighters are not close to where they're supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| relative to that recommended structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| So 282 out of 310 members of our uniformed fire would receive an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| to put them in the correct market position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| and this is the most significant cost of this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| and that would be a little over $543,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| So the total cost for the adjustments to fire would be $677,790.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2974)|
| 0:49:48| Move on to general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| The good news is I'm recommending no structure changes for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| General government is in a good market position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| We're literally just right on, right on market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| But I did want to take that same approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| and not assume that just because the structure is correct that individuals were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| I wanted to take a look at the individuals similar to how we did in police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| If we're going to make those adjustments for police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| we should do likewise with general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| It was actually a very small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I was really pleased to see that even most employees in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| are in the correct market position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| So it would increase 50 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Most of those raises are fairly small, less than $100 for some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| but the total cost of doing that would be a little over $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| just to make sure every general government employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| was actually in the correct market position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| The biggest part of my recommendations for general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and I don't know if you want me to go through these point by point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| I'm going to assume you don't unless you tell me otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| But this chart reflects job classes that I'm recommending for reallocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Reallocation is when we're going to take a job class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| and move it to a different pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| Back before Mercer, before 2008, we had jobs grouped in very large pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| So you might have jobs that should be in five different skill levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| in the same pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| So we may have engineer 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the same pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| So Mercer had to come in and try to pull all those apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| and figure out where they should go in discrete ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| So we knew there was a chance that they didn't get all of them in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| So I've been surveying jobs that we thought were questionable since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| And those that have consistently surveyed out in the wrong grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| either that they should be in a lower grade or a higher grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| any that we've seen a trend, I'm recommending for reallocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| So you may see some jobs in the Segal data that either looked high or low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| and you don't see me making a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| The reason is because that may be the only year we've seen that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| The ones in this chart represent job classes that I have seen repeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| in the data consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| So I feel pretty confident that these jobs need to be reallocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| Many of them need to be reallocated to a lower pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| The impact there is that those employees that get reallocated to a lower pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| will simply reach their maximum faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| It does not take pay away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| But their maximum would go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| so they might reach that maximum sooner in their career than they would otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| If the pay grade is going up, there are a few, and they're mostly in civilian police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| Those are going to be reallocated up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Anything that's reallocated up, you have to adjust any employees below the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| to the new minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| So there is a cost associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So that cost would be a little over $21,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| and that would be to adjust any employees whose job is being reallocated to a higher grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| to the new minimum of that grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| I'm not going to go through these job by job unless you have specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| but I did want to point out animal control officer and senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| because if you noticed in the survey, they do not survey out as being low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| and my data has never surveyed them as being low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| The reason I'm recommending those, those are the only anomaly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| I'm recommending that those go up to a higher pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| because our turnover and our retention in those jobs is just outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| We simply cannot keep employees in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| So while the market data may not dictate it, our current conditions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| For years, we've been unable to retain any employees in those job classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| so we're hopeful that raising the pay in those might help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| I did also want to mention, I'm not going to go through these job by job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| but any jobs that the Siegel survey found to be too low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| if this was the first time we saw that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I'm not recommending them for reallocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| but I'm going to include them in ongoing surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| and if we develop a trend, if we see several years of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| that indicate they should be reallocated, we would do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| So I'm just going to include those in the survey going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| and see if any sort of a trend emerges on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So the total cost to general government would be the combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| of raising those 50 employees who are below their market position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| and raising any employees to a new minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| if we're reallocating their pay grade to a higher grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| So the total cost for general government is $39,643.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| So on the last page, I've just kind of summarized those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| for general government, for police, and for fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| and the total to do all of these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| and this is base pay only, would be $923,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And this is an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| This data literally changes every day as people's pay changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| So this is a pretty good estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| but it is a number that will change somewhat each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3310)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, Ms. Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I think we can open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| This is really helpful, a lot of information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| I just want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Let's go to firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| And under firefighter presently, we have a minimum of $32,167| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and a maximum of $42,444.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| And under the proposed, then the minimum would be $35,000, $42,000, and $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| When you calculated your numbers, then, for those, did you use the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| minimum, midpoint, maximum again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| For the individual adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Okay, so when I did the police and fire in looking at employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| I took this new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| And so we'll just use firefighter as our example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Basically, to create that 10-year model, you take $42,094,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| you subtract $35,824,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| so you now have the difference between the minimum and the midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| You divide that by 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| That's the amount that employee should increase each year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| So then you multiply their years of service by that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| and add that to the minimum, and that's what their pay should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| So you go back and include the amount of time that they have been employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| Yes, so I calculate their time just in job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| So it's not total time with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| So if I'm a firefighter and I've been a firefighter for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| I'm going to get three times that amount added to my minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| and that's the amount I should be at within three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Okay, so that's three years forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| or it doesn't start immediately at that amount, or is it in three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| No, that's the amount they should be making today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| That's what they should make today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| So what I'm recommending we do is we adjust them to that dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| because that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| If our structure were at market based on their years in their job class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| that's the dollar amount they should be making today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Okay, so in essence you're going back and look at each individual employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| If this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| And this is the same thing we did when we did the changes when we did Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| That's exactly the same model that we used then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And anyone, I didn't clarify, but anyone at midpoint or above midpoint is not adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| So this only impacts employees that are below the midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| because the midpoint is considered the market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| so we would not be making adjustments for someone who is at market or above market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| I just had a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| The cost estimates here, is that for an entire budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| And I'll probably kick that over to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| It would depend on the date of implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| This cost I gave you would be for a full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Yes, Vicki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| On the recruits for firefighter and police, that figure, has that figure been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| how long has that figure been that it's been since the Mercer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| When has that been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| I'd actually have to go back and look to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| But I'm not sure how long it's been since that dollar amount has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| It could have changed last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| but without going and looking at the recommendations from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| I wouldn't really be able to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| But that's really the only figure that is not changing because we were at market on recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| So that's why that one didn't receive a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| But with comparable other cities as of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| Councilman Dale Moki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Yeah, I was contemplating Councilman Starr's earlier question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| How do these midpoints compare when you factor back in things like the other perks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3557)|
| 0:59:26| like longevity pay, like automatic pay increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| In other words, how do you compare that to the base pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| adjusted each year in addition to the base pay ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| So how does that work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I'm not sure what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Are you asking how we calculate those into base pay or how we calculate that into the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| Well, how do you look at that in terms of where the employee is compared to the market range of 95%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| We just look at base pay because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| So they could be over that market range when you add the other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| We do survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| We did survey that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| But as Mr. Sussel said, actually turning that into a dollar amount that you can turn into base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| that you can just add to base pay, it's an incredibly difficult thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| And it's not something you can even find many consultants that will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Really all that you can do is base your structures on base pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| and then look at your supplements compared to other people's supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| So if we have longevity and other people have longevity, compare those and adjust longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| But don't use it as an adjustment for base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| And did you do that second part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Well, as the mayor said, that's another good reason for hitting that 95% mark because we do have other pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3645)|
| 1:00:54| Maybe that some of our peers don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| So that sort of gives you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| It kind of gives you that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| We had a lot of discussion today about minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Would we have any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| I don't really know what the minimum wage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| but would we have anyone working for the city who would be below minimum wage at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| No, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| And actually, our pay grade one minimum wage is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| our pay grade one is significantly above minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Pay grade one starts at $10.10 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| So we're doing well in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| I don't see any lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I want to assume that we're ready to move forward with the public forum portion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3709)|
| 1:01:58| Anyone signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Or does anyone wish to address council at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3719)|
| 1:02:10| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| I signed up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| First off, if I can take a moment and reiterate what Councilman Wallace said in his prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| I want to thank every one of the first responders, EMS workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| The last couple of weeks, guys, have been rough for the fire department as well as the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| So being one of them, I certainly want you to know from me, I'm appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| And we carry more than just the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I mean, this eats us up daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| But I want to thank you guys, and I wanted to make that known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| I also want to thank Mr. Sussels and his staff, Mayor O'Hara and her staff, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| for all these meetings that we've been back and forth with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| And I appreciate the continuity that we've come together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| I appreciate what the mayor is trying to get done, what Vicky just spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3790)|
| 1:03:20| This is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I mean, as Mr. Sussels showed on the screen, I don't believe anybody can deny that we are below midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3801)|
| 1:03:31| Getting there is another animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| That's why we have the lovely Mr. Jim York to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| But the thing I'm most excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| I've heard him call it a lot of things, but never that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Nice, handsome, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| No, but I enjoy working with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Sometimes I don't want to say it gets contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| It gets animated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Contentious, is that the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| But I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| I enjoy the back and forth and coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| I mean, that means a lot, especially working with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| But I think it's a starting point, a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| And I hope that if this does pass, as it's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| that we can continue down this road to look at the midpoints in the future, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| even before budget change maybe and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Like Vicky said, we're getting survey data at this time, and anything can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| But I want to thank you all for hearing us and having us out here and thank our guys for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| And I'll close with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3878)|
| 1:04:52| Mark Taylor, 820 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I'm the volunteer watch number two fraternal order of police president representing law enforcement in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| and Knox County and actually some federal agencies and some outliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| You get just a little bit closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Roger that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Appreciate your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Appreciate the time that council is taking to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| We appreciate the commitment of the mayor and her staff, one, two, and council for conducting this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| I think when the original Mercer came up, we'd said maybe five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| We had some changes in leadership, and it got difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| We're a little bit past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| But I think it's important to do that because we made a big commitment on the Mercer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and it's important to go back and gauge that as close as we can to see how that affected things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| and whether we do need to continue policies, change policies on pay and compensation, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| When we talk about compensation, really at the end of the day is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| Are we keeping people here, the people that we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Because everything now is a business proposition, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| What are you getting for your money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| What bang are you getting for your bucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| And I understand council has to do that, and I understand you make hard decisions on behalf of the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| and the employees, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Our organization appreciates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| When you talk about competitive advantage, you're looking at your competitive advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| Kevin Faddis and his guys, Sergeant Coffey back there and his group down in the central business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| that deal with a diverse group of things, all across this to the guys that are out there picking up trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| that are answering the 311 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Your people are your product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| They're your competitive advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| So if we talk business, that's what the city has to offer back to its citizens, the services it can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4006)|
| 1:06:55| When we talk about compensation, we talk about protecting that competitive advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| A business invests in its competitive advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| If you're making a widget and that thing's hot, you invest in research and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| you stay ahead of the market, you apple it, you keep it good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| You want that market share there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| You don't want to lose your market share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| You don't want to lose the people that give you your competitive advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| So this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Compensation is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| And I frame this because with the police department in particular, I'll give you a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| I came here in 1998, and my ID number is 1688.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4050)|
| 1:07:38| And at that time, we had an authorized strength of 456 police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| And when I got out of the police academy and I got out of that training, that year-long training it took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| when it hit the streets, they would call us almost every night and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| who's willing to stay over and work because we're short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Who will pull another shift?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Who will put in some extra time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| And we're still in that position now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Our authorized strength now is 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| We're down about, even on our strength, 40 officers even unauthorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| I think our current strength is 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Our guys are running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| They've been running hard for a while, and that takes its toll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| During that time, right now, this last class, I looked it up, the last person is number 2170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| That is 482 officers that we have trained since I became a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4108)|
| 1:08:38| and got finished with my training roughly 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Now, it costs us about $100,000 to train a police officer and put them on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| And then it takes about four to five years for that police officer to be truly effective out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| That's where they get to the point that they know how to talk to people without making them too mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| They know how to handle situations without calling another guy over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| and wasting his time pulling him away from your beat or your beat to handle a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| And we've lost 482 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| We've trained another 482 people since I came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| If you put that into a dollar amount, we've spent $48,200,000 just on direct training costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| direct initial training costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| That's not counting what it costs to put them on a special team, what it costs to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| Part of recruiting is retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| These are serious issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| We have a lot of turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| That's enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Just the experience that you lose going out into your community when you have that is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| So it's important that we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| It's important, and I appreciate this, and this is a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| And I'm here to support the mayor's initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| We need to look hardcore at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| We need to look, as a business would, if we were having these costs and turnovers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| If you take that over 15 years, on an average of the 15 years I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| we've spent $3.2 million in training costs because of turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| $3.2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| So I guess my point is with that, and I'll wrap it up and get out of your way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| I'm in favor of the mayor's initiative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| I think it's a good way to start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I think we need to look strong at this, and we need to look strong going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| because we need those people to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| We have a 25-year pension when I came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| We've got a little bit more year pension than that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| We shouldn't be losing 482 people, or we shouldn't be having to be training 482 people over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4249)|
| 1:10:59| So we appreciate any consideration you'll give compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| We think it's important to also look at the top end of that scale too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| because as the market changes and as policing changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| those people that we do get to stay here, and especially as the next pension kicks in and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| they're going to be vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| They're already vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| It's just a matter of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| But even at the end of the day, we need those people here for their value to our community and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| We've paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| We've trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| We deserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Our citizens deserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Madam Mayor, do you have any closing remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| Again, thank you, Council, for this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I do want to say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| First, you know, we committed something like $215,000, I think, to this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| something that we all agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| We put it in the budget, and we can't let it sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| We spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| We've got to take action on what it showed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| There's some very clear findings in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Our proposal, we think, fairly addresses those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Again, this is, you know, our goal is to be competitive and to stay competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| So this is the next move in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| And in future years, next budget, you know, future budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| we always want to make sure that we are staying competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| But this is a jump right now to get to those targets that Vicki mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| I do want to say that I feel very fortunate as mayor to have the employee groups that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| our general government, police and fire, their representatives, their leadership are excellent to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| They are very passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| They challenge us constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| They push back on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| But they are also very practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| And so I appreciate that they would come out tonight and support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Again, it's not all that they want, and they've made that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| But it's what we feel like we can do now, and it's what we will bring to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Is it the first meeting in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| So the first or second, and, you know, it will take two votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| And we anticipate initiating this February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| We will then, of course, be working on our budget for July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| We will have the salary study back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And then as additional adjustments have to be made, like we always do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| then we'll bring those to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| We have to stay competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| But this is something that we anticipated when we went out for the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| We knew that police and fire particularly, that we had problems in terms of being competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| And the study showed it, and so we need to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| And if you have any other questions, feel free to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| If you have details about these recommendations, please call Vicki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| And we'll be glad to explain that in more detail to you one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| And we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877141204?start=4448)|
