| 0:00:28| Hello, everyone. We're going to call to order the Knox County Personnel Committee meeting for March 25, 2020, 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=28)|
| 0:00:39| I'll call the roll. Commissioner Oster here. Commissioner Lee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| Commissioner Daley here. Commissioner Hill here. Stephanie Candler here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| Kim Frazier. I'm present. Thank you all for being with us today. Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Seeing none. Motion to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| All right. We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| All right. Moving on to approval of the minutes. If you had a chance to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| So I have a motion to approve. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| Motion to approve by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Moving on to public forum. We have one speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| We have Mr. Jackson Fenner. Hello, Mr. Fenner. Would you like to state your name and your county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| Can you hear me? Yes, sir. OK. My name is Jackson Fenner. I think I've met most of you up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| I live in Knox County. Ms. Lee is my representative. I just wanted to talk about the law library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| I know there's been a lot of changes to the law library here in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| I know there's been some talk. I've talked to Ms. Lee about this, about the funding for the Nexus Lexus or for the Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=106)|
| 0:01:57| And I just wanted to support the idea that we have the full country, all the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| I know there's a price difference, which to me, whatever it is, $1,200, $1,300 is a pretty small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| The reason why is because there are oftentimes as attorneys, we will come into issues or representing somebody who's accused of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=131)|
| 0:02:22| And the issue might not have been ruled on in this state yet. So maybe we can find a case in a different state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| Maybe this is what the judges in Florida are doing on this issue that we haven't ruled on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| This is persuasive authority that we can use to try to make our case, to represent our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| This is for indigent defendants. This is the same clientele that the public defenders represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| They don't represent this particular defendant because there might be a conflict of interest for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| The private bar, like myself and Ms. Lee and many other lawyers, we have to accept these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| We have the lowest rate of pay of all appointed attorneys in the country in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| So all we're asking for is resources that are comparable to what the public defender's office already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| And that office, they already have all this access to Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Plus they have secretaries and they have social workers and they have all these other resources that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| I think it would just be fair, not just to us. This is not really for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| This is for the people that we are trying to represent who need us to be able to do our job to the fullest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| So we're just asking that the law library be fully funded and that the Westlaw be nationwide, nationwide, not just limited Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| Thank you, Mr. Finner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| That's it. And I hope that the library is up and running again because we miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you for being here. Thank you for the comments. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| All right. I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Moyers now for a discussion of the subscription renewal, the quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Sure. So as you recall, one of the first things that we started looking at when we took over oversight of the law library was whether we needed the books that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=240)|
| 0:04:12| We recognized that a lot of the books were out of date, had not been updated, and nobody really complained about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| But what was clear was that the attorneys were using the Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| And in truth, as a longtime attorney myself and a former judge, I almost never touched a physical book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| Westlaw and Lexis are absolutely vital to the modern practice law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| There's no substitute for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| So to get down to the nitty gritty, what we were paying for currently was $3,310 per month for three terminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=278)|
| 0:04:50| That equals out to just shy of $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| That's what we're paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| And the reason we're paying so much is because we had subscribed to a number of services that were almost never used by the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| They had to do with legal treatises and things like that that really, unless you're involved in the academic practice of law, you're just not going to use very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=305)|
| 0:05:14| So we've stripped that down to its bare essence, which is just basically cases and statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| And now you're faced with a choice between two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Both of them involve six terminals, so we're doubling the access under either plan over what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| To start with the second option, that is just Tennessee and binding federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So Sixth Circuit, which is, let's see if I can remember, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan, I believe, and Tennessee cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=337)|
| 0:05:49| And honestly, 99% of the time, well, maybe 75% of the time, that's all you're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| But the second option is to have access to all jurisdictions, all 50 states, all federal court decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| That certainly gives you a wider scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| And I'd echo what Jackson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| There are times when that's vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Not every issue that human beings can come up with has been addressed yet by the Tennessee courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| And so when that happens, very often you look at how it's been addressed in other courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| We have what are called majority views and minority views, where the courts will go through and look at how various courts have handled things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And so this is a necessary thing for the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| The law director's office has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Most attorney's offices have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| If we choose that, it is twice as much as the first option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| It's about $30,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| But I would point out that's still $10,000 a year less than what we're paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| And when you combine that with the fact that we've eliminated the law librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and we've canceled the subscription to many of the books, the hardcover books we were using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| it seems to me that that's well within the budget of the law library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| It provides a service that folks like Jackson need in order to, and Commissioner Lee, of course, that they need to represent their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=425)|
| 0:07:15| So if you ask my opinion, that's the option I would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Does anyone have any comments or input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Yes, I would like to echo Mr. Finner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And I'll tell you kind of to break it down, when we're looking at these other cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| when we're doing a motion like a motion to suppress or any kind of motion, we have to have authority for that inside those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| So a few weeks ago, I was doing a drug case where there was a dog sniff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| And that wasn't in Tennessee, but it was ruled on in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| But had we not had access to Westlaw with that, I wouldn't have been able to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| So it's crucial in us doing our motions and being argued to the court because we just can't go in there and say we're arguing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Somewhere in the country, they might have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| We have to be able to say where it was, in Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| And it's called, if it's, you know, somewhere real close to us around Tennessee, they would call that a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| And the judges would give it a whole lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| And then we have what's called persuasive and then permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| But we need those cases in order to argue that on behalf of our clients to the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| And it is what the public defenders have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| And we are public defenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| We just don't get paid by the public defender's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| So it is crucial for our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And it's not for the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| It's on behalf of indigent defense that would be ineffective for us to represent them without having these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| We are getting six terminals versus three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| And the price is still, you know, if you break it down, I mean, it's roughly, I mean, it is more, but it's less than what we were paying to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| But it is crucial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| So I hope this committee will approve us having the full access to Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Mr. Moyers, the option one is the Tennessee and option two is national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| If we go with the national, Tennessee is covered under that national also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Oh, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Yeah, it's Tennessee and all other states and all federal jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| I have no objection to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| I totally understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| I'm just curious, since our public defender's office has this, is there not any way that, excuse me, that we can piggyback on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:47| No, they don't share our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| They do not share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-personnel-committee?start=592)|
