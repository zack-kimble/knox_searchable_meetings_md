| 2:15:44| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Yeah, he got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| We've hired Fulgham-McIndoe and Associates to do a traffic impact study out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8150)|
| 2:15:57| and we're prepared to make any improvement out there needed to conform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| to county engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| I spoke with Billy Fulgham of Fulgham-McIndoe today and asked him, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| you know, how's this process work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| He said, you know, it's a combination of MPC traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| and Knox County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| So we're prepared to do traffic counts out there and improve Old Andy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| or could be Andy's too, whatever comes from the traffic study from the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| and the county's engineers, we're prepared to make those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| And I think overall, it shouldn't make for a better road for those people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| I think this is going to be a way for an improvement for the county is this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| Was there any additional discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| Mr. Green, I'm looking at the documents that the MPC provided and on the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| report, it says that the residential to the west of the property is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| built out at 1.7 and 1.92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| And I'm guessing when you read the next note about the neighborhood context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8232)|
| 2:17:20| when they're saying that the density is less than two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| is that why that the staff recommended 2.5 dwelling units per acre to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| That paired combined with the slope analysis, which indicated or recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| a density of approximately 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8261)|
| 2:17:41| And so the planning commission then upped it from 2.5 to 3.0 as their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| So they did give the developer some extra density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| I was going to ask Mr. Sanders, how does, so I don't think we can put conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| on a zoning, say if he doesn't, you know, we put four on an acre and then he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| doesn't improve the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| I mean, we can't stop him from building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8298)|
| 2:18:18| If I may, I want commissioner, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| But I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| And then if you, if the traffic impact analysis identifies that's done as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| result of the proposed development or submitted with the plan, the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| identified in that traffic impact analysis would become a condition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| approval and permitting those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| I think that's what you've referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8322)|
| 2:18:42| So, so what we did, we filed for plan residential zoning under that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| We'll have to bring concept land back in front of planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Uh, I believe their threshold is 7,850 trip units per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| We're well above 750 trip units per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| So we would be required to do the traffic impact study and complete those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| improvements to get an approved concept plan on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8349)|
| 2:19:09| I'm gonna make a motion that with the, because the lawyer has stated in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| testimony, he said, we can't, the road can't handle one of the two said the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| road can't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| So I will make a motion that we approve for, and with the, with the knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| that Gerald and the plan residential, the condition is that in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| residential, if he can't do the traffic study, then the approve the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| revert, I guess, revert back or can't build, he can't build without the, can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| build without traffic study period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8381)|
| 2:19:41| Not at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| I approve for a four unit or I'll make a motion to approve four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8388)|
| 2:19:48| We have a motion from commissioner Anders to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| Four units an acre with that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| Could you please, or there isn't, we don't put a condition on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| That's in the plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8396)|
| 2:19:56| In the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| And it was seconded by commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| I guess a quick question I've got is just around, uh, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| noticed this was also a development that had some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| about the slope protection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| Uh, could you elaborate on that just a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| Those are, uh, also the slope and we'll work with, uh, the developer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| protect the steeper areas through the, um, plan approval process, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| the plan development, which started that discussion already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| So that's something that can be reviewed during the review of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| development plan and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| I mean, with the, uh, with the density in a, in a more concentrated area on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| property, I mean, is it still ability to kind of protect the slopes as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| slope analysis is done while, I mean, cause if you get much higher than four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| I keep wondering if we're going to encroach on the slopes as a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| of our, our slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| So just, if you could elaborate on that just a little bit, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| I'm going to put the, uh, follow in their court because they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| be doing the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| But we have discussed what we met early on in this project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| discussed the need to protect some of those steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8461)|
| 2:21:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| So, so I have, uh, the slope analysis that was performed by the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| commission staff and of this 30 acres, 14.09 is considered non hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| So, uh, they recommended a lower density, but I would argue that, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| should be allowed to have, you know, the maximum density under low density, low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| density residential on a non hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| 4.22 acres was a zero to 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| And, uh, and the back portion of this property, it is fairly sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| So I think, you know, they're over 50% of the property is, or right at 50% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| the property is considered non hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| And, uh, you know, in East Tennessee, I would think that's pretty, that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| So, I mean, I think, you know, we can concentrate some density down, like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Green said, and we'll work with his staff, concentrates the density down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| on the non hillside portions and, uh, be able to perform preserves and the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| And I'm just catching up on the math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| So is that, did you say it's about 14 acres that are flat and at four units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| acre, that'd be what, around 56 homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| Well, 14 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8535)|
| 2:22:15| That would be around 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| Um, on the flatter part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8542)|
| 2:22:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8543)|
| 2:22:23| Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| And when did it have Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Snowden for the record, come up and say that he agrees with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8546)|
| 2:22:35| And also, was there anything in the road plan for this intersection of old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8555)|
| 2:22:44| No, there's, um, the, the intersection as it states now is, um, I mean, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| Ryan's point that they are going to improve it somewhat, it comes in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| kind of a bad angle, uh, it's relatively narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| So, I mean, I think that, uh, the development would make some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| to the roadway that the overall public could, uh, could see benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8578)|
| 2:23:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8587)|
| 2:23:07| I've got, uh, commissioners, Gil Beeler and, uh, Jay to call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| So commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8593)|
| 2:23:13| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| I just simply wanted to acknowledge that you, the opposition may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| present, but you had lots of opposition in terms of their concerns from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| public via the emails that were sent with the documentation we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| And I think one of the core concerns the public acknowledged was that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| size of the road and the potential, um, hazardous nature of what was where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| people have lived, uh, for a very long time, but you have just indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| that you are, uh, proposing road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| What else has the community indicated to you was their core concern aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| from the road and the additional traffic that that will bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| So the second concern that, uh, and I've had multiple conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| surrounding community members is there's a cemetery on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| There's a historic cemetery on the property and we'll protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| Uh, you know, I mean, there's federal, state and local laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| against, you know, that'll be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| And, uh, so, you know, we're, we're fully aware of the cemetery issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| and, and how we'll have to protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| I think that was their second concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| So, and, and, and those two concerns have already been addressed and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| feel confident in the recommendations from what was indicated by what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| said, road improvements and protection of the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| I believe so, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8672)|
| 2:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Thank you, Commissioner Kilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8676)|
| 2:24:36| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I have two questions for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| Snowden and then one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8678)|
| 2:24:46| Hello, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8686)|
| 2:24:46| Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| Hello, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8689)|
| 2:24:49| Um, first question is, uh, is it correct that Ball Homes has agreed to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8689)|
| 2:24:56| the roads based on the results of the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| That will be a condition of the concept plan and we won't allow a design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| to move forward until those improvements are either met or bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8708)|
| 2:25:08| Is it also true that regardless of the zoning density, engineering will monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8708)|
| 2:25:14| the slope, um, of anything that's built there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8714)|
| 2:25:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8719)|
| 2:25:19| They will have to meet the, uh, concept plan and subsequent design plan, uh, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| all the best management practices that stormwater and, uh, uh, you know, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| general, general good practices of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| So we would require those things to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| And the comment I would make is that, you know, as we have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| developers that appear before us, I think as developers go, Ball Homes has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| pretty impeccable reputation for doing really quality work and also for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| what they say they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| So I think that should count for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| Thank you, Commissioner Bailard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8756)|
| 2:25:56| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| Um, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Sorry, I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Um, if the traffic study, uh, old, uh, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| I'm looking at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8767)|
| 2:26:07| The old Andes Road, uh, your development sits sort of on the first half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| If you were coming in from say the West, it looks like, um, if the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| stuff clearly would be coming out there, there'll be potentially how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| many homes in this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Uh, you know, on the 30 acres, if you, if you did the four units, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| know, you come up to 120, so homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| So in the 120 something homes, they're all not going to turn right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8793)|
| 2:26:33| That's because you're going to be able to get over to Chert Pit and sort of get backroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| If the traffic study comes back and says it recommends improving the entire old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| Andes Road from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| Are you all prepared to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8807)|
| 2:26:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8810)|
| 2:26:50| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| We have a motion that is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8821)|

| 2:27:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| Madam clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Item 46 has already been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| So we're on item 47, 9-A-19-CP is a request of Knoxville, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| Planning Commission for consideration of approval of the Governor John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| Tver Scenic Highway Corridor Study in Commission Districts 8 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8838)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8846)|
| 2:27:26| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| Chair, members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| By vote of 15 to zero, the Knoxville, Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| recommended approval of the John Tver Scenic Highway Corridor Plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| subsequent amendments to the Knoxville, Knox County General Plan in the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| County and the East County Sector Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| The corridor study was done at the direction of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| A resolution was forwarded from the commission to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| asking the study to be done at stakeholder committee involving key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| citizens of the area, including Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| Brown, guided the development of that corridor plan, corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| The stakeholders met several times to discuss various issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| There were two large community meetings, over 150 members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| community participated in those meetings and the plan made three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| recommendations, one that development of a corridor overlay be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| for the corridor, that would take another effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| Separate effort, and we have to work with the community to develop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| overlay, come back before this commission for any approval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| The other was that DOT undertake a safety survey analysis of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| Working with engineering and public works, we have tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| initiate that safety study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| The TDOT has stated that the thresholds for a safety study have not been met yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| We'll continue to monitor through that, work with engineering and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| works and TDOT to address any safety concerns on the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| The final recommendation was that the existing community groups, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| residents, homeowners associations, churches work together and volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| efforts to undertake beautification efforts along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| We'll continue to work with the neighborhoods and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| engineering and public works to monitor that and work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| neighborhood along the corridor to improve the aesthetics of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8960)|
| 2:29:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8968)|
| 2:29:28| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8968)|
| 2:29:28| Brown, would you like to add something to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| I don't know how much I can add, but let me just, first off, my name's Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| Brown, 7320 Twin Creek Road, 379 Terry zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| Uh, me and commissioner Daly are extremely happy to bring this to, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| see this come to fruition tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Personally, I've been working and fighting for Jones River highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| since the back, the old three, three county commission court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| So that's been a long time talking about early seventies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| Commissioner Daly, I know for the last almost 30 years has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| been doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| A lot of people have put a lot of hours into this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| We've had a lot of meetings and we've been happy to work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9010)|

| 2:30:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9025)|
| 2:30:25| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9025)|
| 2:30:26| I had the pleasure of attending one of the planning meetings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| this as a guest of Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| And I was able to see firsthand a lot of the hard work that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| So I'm very excited to see this coming to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| So, uh, chair, we'll look to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| Daly for a recommendation or excuse me, we've got Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| Smith over here with a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9045)|
| 2:30:45| Director Green, I just wanted to point out and make sure clarity is made on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| this, that, uh, this does not undermine people's rights of their property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| it does not, um, change the function of zoning, but it doesn't in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| sense, change the form and the look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| This is just the policy documents or it doesn't even change the form and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| yet the, uh, that would have to be the corridor overlay to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| And that would be the next step that would take a lot of community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| and working with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| But that's what I mean, going in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9080)|
| 2:31:20| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| Uh, back to you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9083)|
| 2:31:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| I'm back to Commissioner Gill or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| Uh, yes, I think, thank you, uh, uh, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| Chairman and Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| And cause I attended the presentation when, when they came to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| presentation, but I just want to make an, um, acknowledgement because part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| what we're trying to do intersects the growth plan, those sector plans in all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| So my, this, this is, this is, this is part of the conversation we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| What role does this then play into the larger scheme of what we approved earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9112)|
| 2:31:59| Could you just offer some clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| The, uh, a plan such as this, the corridor plan and neighborhood plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| small area plans provide a more detailed look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| If you're trying to do an analogy, the general plan forms the framework for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| for a, uh, building these corridor plans like this are likely the fixtures in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9135)|
| 2:32:22| kitchen add a lot more detail to those, to the general plan and to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| It's a more closed, more, uh, detailed look at a specific topic or issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| or area within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9158)|
| 2:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Back to you, Commissioner Beale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| I want to second what, uh, Commissioner Smith says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| No one will lose their property rights there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| It's, you know, we will still follow the general plan, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| growth plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| Same thing in the eighth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| So this is a good overlay plan to start out with and it's overwhelmingly 80, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9175)|
| 2:33:02| going to say 86, 87% in favor and only maybe 5% that didn't really oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| They just didn't say they would support some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| So this is a good plan and this is the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| And I would like to make a motion that we approve the, uh, Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| John Sevier Highway Corridor Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9205)|
| 2:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9206)|
| 2:33:26| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9209)|
| 2:33:29| It was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9210)|
| 2:33:30| I was coughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| Commissioner Bealer is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9213)|
| 2:33:33| Additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| It's a slightly off topic, but, um, Director Green, we've seen a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9215)|
| 2:33:41| studies on various corridors in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| Uh, there is one corridor that has a great deal of vacant land left on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| When will we be studying that the best way to develop it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| And that is the Western Avenue Oak Ridge Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| And, uh, the process would be, we've had it on our work plan and it always gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| bumped, gets what we would like is a, uh, resolution from the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| directing us to do it, then we'll put it, move it up on the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=9251)|
