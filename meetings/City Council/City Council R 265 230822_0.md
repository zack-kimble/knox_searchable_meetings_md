| 0:02:36| Now, it is time for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| First, Councilmembers, I know you are probably aware, as I have, that in the last 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| two Knoxville neighbors were struck by vehicles and died on the streets of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| These are tragic deaths, and my heart goes out to the victims and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| I happen to personally know the Kredits family, so, you know, definitely keeping them in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| thoughts and prayers as they undergo this unthinkable tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| I did want to say that there are too many families in Knoxville who have had their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| changed forever due to crashes that result in a fatality or serious injury, and thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| to Council's support, we are trying to make a change in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| We have helped bring community partners together with the goal in mind of having zero deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| We can make our streets safer for everyone who uses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Through this Vision Zero process, I am committed to an aspirational goal of eliminating traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| fatalities on city-controlled roads by 2040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| This will take a lot of partners, a lot of city departments working together, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| take education, enforcement, and engineering to stop preventable crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| One big step was creating a data-driven action plan, and that is now online at KnoxvilleTN.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| slash Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| This is a guiding document to inspire and inform action and investment in the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| We all play a part in making our roads safer for everyone so that no one has to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| the tragedy of losing a loved one to a preventable crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| I also wanted to provide an update following the storms that ripped through our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| on August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| FEMA is in town this week for a joint preliminary damage assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| We had millions of dollars in reported damages countywide, and FEMA teams will be assessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| the need for both public and individual assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| So I want to again thank all of our first responders and public service crews who worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| around the clock to clear roads, remove fire hazards, and restore power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And we will, of course, keep council members up to date on the damage assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Also, our rules of decorum for those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| or during public forum, please sign up with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| All rules state that up to three people each may speak for or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So if there is an agenda item that has more than three people signed up for or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| consider consolidating the number of people to have a spokesperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| Please do not use profanity, and when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| For those of you who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you in advance for respecting these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| That concludes my mayor's report, and now it is time for council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| Council Member Thomas and then Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| On the matter of pedestrian safety, I did want to note the completion of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| on Atlantic Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| That's about eight blocks of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| It was not an easy task to complete, and it took a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| I also want to express appreciation to the neighbors there that had the patience, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| it will pay off, and I appreciate the engineering job for what a really good job they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=365)|

| 0:07:25| Agenda item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| The candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Jocelyn Hundley is the Vice President of Community Development at First Horizon Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Just before Ms. Hundley joined their team, First Horizon reached a settlement with HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| over allegations that the bank discriminated against African-American and Hispanic mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| loan applicants by denying them mortgage loans and by allegedly failing to place bank branches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| in minority-concentrated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Now, reading Ms. Hundley's resume, it seems like her work has been an effort to undo the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| harm that has been done by First Horizon, and I applaud that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| But I still question the decision to put someone tied to First Horizon Bank in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Secondly, Houston Smeltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| I apologize if I've mispronounced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| He's the Senior VP at Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| McNabb already has too much influence over city policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| McNabb fought against the community movement for an alternative response program for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| before you all voted unanimously to proceed with that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| This is an advisory board, and it should include people impacted by the actions of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| like Candidate Kincannon used to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Now, Knoxville's affordable housing program is set to spend $50 million over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Well, we've already spent $15 million in the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| So each year moving forward, we will be spending less than what we did when we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| And that's assuming that the next mayor or two continues this program for the full 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Chattanooga has a similar funding promise, but their commitment is $100 million over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| five years, which is twice the funding in half the time and potentially doable in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| mayor's tenure in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| So what can Knoxville as a city do about this affordable housing crisis if this fund isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| exactly the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| First, we can fix the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| We can write an ordinance that prohibits the approval of any pilot that doesn't truly support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Maybe that means a minimum percentage of units with rates tied to the median income or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| other metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| But we need to quit giving millions of dollars to swanky hotels and student apartments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| charge $1,000 per head for a quad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| What have other cities done in similar crises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| To target immediate needs, application fee limits or bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Apartments charge $40 to $80 or more for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| And if you're facing a 60% increase in your rent, it's not a good time to be spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| several hundred dollars just trying to find another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| There's nothing that prevents unscrupulous landlords from accepting applications when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| they know they have no units available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Other states and cities have successfully implemented limits and bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Second, we could focus codes enforcement on properties that are having big rate hikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| If out-of-state corporate landlords are going to come in and increase rents, they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| bring these apartments up to health and safety requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| In the past weeks, I've canvassed two properties where tenants reported electrical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| potential fire hazards, and persistent black mold, both owned and recently purchased by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| Rand Properties and supposedly upgraded by the same company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| I've seen hazardous repair work to stairways and entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| And if we send a message that these massive rate hikes means that we're going to intensely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| scrutinize your property, it may slow down some of the worst offenders on these rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| hikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| What else can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Some of these ideas have been mentioned, but I feel like the Council's looking for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| So here's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| This has been mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Bond issues with the city's low rate for revolving housing loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| We have a small program that does something similar to that already, but we could grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| We also have the Homemaker Program, but we could expand and promote that program and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| revise the rules because there are currently non-owner-occupied properties that are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| to participate, rental units and stuff like that, that aren't necessarily having to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| affordable under the current Homemaker Program, at least as far as I'm able to tell from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Going a step further, we could eminent domain blighted and commercial and industrial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| along our corridors and downtown to add to the available pool of property that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| use for low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| We could also eminent domain major code violators and turn their units into co-ops or public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| You all are in the driver's seats for Knoxville during a housing crisis, whether that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| you want it to be or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| The future of this city depends on creative solutions that you can come up with to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| people despite the state government's interference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| You can't just use that as an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Hi, my name is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| I'm from Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Hope you all are doing well tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Some of you are friendly faces that I recognize from our community meeting at Tanglewood this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Unfortunately, I don't really want to be, if I'm being totally honest with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| that this is a resolution for affordable housing, appointing two members to the Affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| Housing Fund Advisory Committee, but I'm here to talk about the disconnect between those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| two members and the people they're going to represent and the people that are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| We're putting on an Affordable Housing Fund Committee a banker and a former treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| On paper, those people are great, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| They have outstanding character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| They're obviously great with budget, and they've proven their community service here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| However, that being said, as Mr. Givens just pointed out, and I just said, there's a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| disconnect there, and it's almost exclusively socioeconomic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| That is not how it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| One appointee listed, Ms. Jocelyn Hunley, is right now sitting on the board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| for HomeSource of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| I took the liberty to look on their webpage, and it does say that they were implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| recently to search for trustworthy pathways to homeownership or high-quality, affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| So, if I just got appointed to this brand-new board, I would take time to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| project is finished before joining another advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| I recently called HomeSource myself, because I'm in need of some kind of assistance right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| They've already doubled, as mentioned in the last meeting here, and they don't have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Have it on recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Told by a representative, you know, to make an account online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| They'll check back in with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I did make that account online, got an email verifying my account was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Never got any kind of follow-up from HomeSource East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Recalled, was told to check back in in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| That's not a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I've called every single resource available at 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| No resource has any funding available, except for I will give it to Ladies of Charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| They can offer $75 in rental or utility assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| That's the only source available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| These two people do not understand the current issues at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I'm not sure anybody I'm currently talking to really fully understands the issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| we're dealing with, the current reality for 350 people at Tanglewood alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| There's even more at the Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| I don't have that exact count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| There's over 1,100 people right now listed as homeless in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| That number is going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| That is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| There needs to be some type of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| We are circling around the idea of things we could do to resolve these issues, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| not actually voting to resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| We have to bring them to the table and actually take, as mentioned last meeting, bold action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=872)|

| 0:31:18| I've always wanted to talk to you all about layers and about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| things appear one way at first glance, but then when you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| to peel back the layers, it's not so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| That's this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Respectfully requesting the Tennessee General Assembly, instead of respectfully addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1897)|
| 0:32:04| the assembly, which is today, yesterday, I'm not seeing a whole lot going on there except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| for people being thrown out for speaking their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1930)|
| 0:32:20| Instead of petitioning the state to support this resolution, Mr. Roberto, and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| of you, except for Councilperson Amelia Parker, maybe you should have respectfully requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1951)|
| 0:32:45| that they do their job over there this week, what their job was supposed to be, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| is gun control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Last week there was a, and this is another thing, another one of those peel back things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| there was a, for want of a better word, a bus show that took place at West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=1984)|
| 0:33:20| last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2000)|

| 0:33:22| Again, on the surface it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Gloria Johnson was there, Sam McKenzie was there, Mr. Roberto, Ms. Ryder, Mayor, others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2005)|
| 0:33:39| but okay, one thing, Knoxville City is not in the, the city of Knoxville does not control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2019)|
| 0:33:52| the school system, that's the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2032)|

| 0:34:01| led function, because no, when it comes to the right thing, when it comes to gun control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2041)|
| 0:34:12| when it comes to making sure that children are not murdered in the bathroom, there should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| be no partisanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| There should be no partisanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| So county mayor should have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| At least, at least if you have to be partisan, at least I would have thought perhaps Daisha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| Lundy and or Courtney Durrett, I didn't see them there, but you really got to get serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| about what you're doing and stop making all these photo opportunities and these campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| stops and these, these misrepresentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2091)|
| 0:35:00| You got to be sincere, you got to be, you got to be, I'm not going to use the word transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| because it doesn't mean anything anymore, but you got to do the right thing because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| it's the right thing to do and that's the only reason you're doing it, not because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| a Democrat, not because you're a Republican, not because you're a council person, a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| sheriff, a city police chief or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2120)|
| 0:35:30| It's because you're human beings and those, those children that have been killed, murdered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| in our schools, next to our schools, down the street from our schools, they won't ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| get to vote for any of you or anybody because they're dead and you could stop that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| just stop looking at yourselves and look at those children and that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2152)|
| 0:36:03| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| Mr. Roach, if you come to the podium, state your name and address for the record and you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2171)|
| 0:36:22| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2182)|

| 0:36:43| First, find out where their hearts truly are, have them express it and pass expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2203)|
| 0:36:54| Medicaid, TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| It is that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| That's what you advocate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| That's what you have them advocate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| What you don't do is have a joint Knox County Commission, city council and others try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2224)|
| 0:37:16| do a history of how everything has been screwed up through the last couple of decades because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| basically what ends up happening is you don't take responsibility, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| You don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| And we've had hijacking, I'm going to use that word and I mean it, it's hijacking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| a program that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| It will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| It happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| This is thoroughly frustrating to be honest with you, Vice Mayor and whoever else cares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| to soak it in with sincere ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2285)|
| 0:38:17| You're going to cause a lot of suffering because of the hijinks that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| as of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| You're going to cause a lot of people to go without basic care, well they already are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2308)|
| 0:38:38| going without basic care, but it's going to extend the time period that nothing is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| nothing sufficient is done, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| So literally you are letting the inmates run the prison, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| And we can't keep doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| We can't keep doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| When Ms. Parker put forth the resolution in a very sincere fashion, it became a very cloudy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2343)|
| 0:39:13| issue because you even said it openly, hey, I'm going to come with my own stuff and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| going to do this expanded thing and there was no indication that everything, every element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| of what you were putting forth in your resolution was going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Because nobody was listening, the people who could make the decisions and get this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| done hadn't been listening before, didn't really give a damn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| So what were you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Is there a secret fund out here somewhere that's convincing people, oh yeah, now's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| time to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| I wonder, I truly wonder, and if you want to think I'm questioning your motivations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| and all this, well, I can't help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| I can only go by what I see and what I've experienced and what I've advocated for in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| the past and what I've watched and what I've had people say to me who make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| I've had state representatives tell me we can't afford Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| When the program came down through the ACA, the first three years, a billion dollars a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| year coming to the state of Tennessee, and keep in mind, we're a negative net as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| as funds coming in the state and going out of the state and coming into the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| We take in more from the federal government than we do send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| But yet, we couldn't afford to take a billion dollars a year for the first three years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| get the program started, to get health care, reasonably priced health care, to people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| So you want to sit up here and talk about a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| There have been over 30 hospitals, most of them rural hospitals, that are shut down in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2461)|
| 0:41:11| the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| So where's that desire that you're saying that's going to all of a sudden pop up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2475)|

| 0:41:34| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Constance Every, 37914 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Hey, Knoxville, this is election season, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| It's election season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| So let's run this down real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| As I said before, when we talked about this proposal that Andrew brought forward, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| definitely a hijacking of heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| More importantly, it's how you all are talking about trying to evolve this program going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Let's talk about a little bit behind-the-door detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Like, for example, under this particular initiative, we will be creating a mental health court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| where these people will go through the court system and then be given an option of basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| going to jail or going to the hospital, because that's where they want to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| They want to build the hospital out there by the jail people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| That's where they want to put this at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And so, again, we're still dealing with criminalization of mental health and services, because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| we know from the real experts, meaning the people that do this for a living, the mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| health folks, those people particularly, we know that this is not how you go about initiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| these type of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| You cannot criminalize these people into the necessary care and treatment that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| It has to come from a holistic, compassionate point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| And that's not what you're doing, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| You're trying to make sure that the purse strings stay tied to it by bringing in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| CEOs and your executive friends versus what we originally had with HEART, which was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| mental health and clinical therapist specialists instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| More importantly, everybody that attended the meeting, we have to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| The state gave us the data, and the state made it very clear that they are supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Knoxville in mental health, to the tune of $50 million, 500 percent increase over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| last 11 years, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| So the real question is, actually, where is the money, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| That's the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Where is the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| So we don't have to vet the state for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| And if the state was serious when they were here at the meeting, they wouldn't have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| within 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| They would have actually stayed for the entire meeting to make it truthful to us as the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| that they were serious about this initiative from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| More importantly, what are we doing in Robert rule of order here, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| How is new business, which is Andrew's initiative, actually going forward over old business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| which is Amelia's initiative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Help me understand that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| How are you all actually doing this particular initiative on the agenda in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| So, again, Knoxville, call it for what it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| It is a political stunt and a final, I mean, desperate, we ought to call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| It is a desperate attempt by India to look like she cares about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| When she doesn't, like, Knoxville, be for real, she does not care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| If she cared, she would have brought Lakeshore back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| If she cared, she would have took Amelia Parker and Hartnell three years ago, not three years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| If she was serious, she would have been brought in implication of an alternative response to take the pressure off of KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| and have this alternative dispatch resource that would come through for these type of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So, again, Knoxville, four years, and we have waited four years for a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| We have waited four years for real strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| We have waited or we have watched four years of people like Amelia Parker and Hart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| and other people being ignored by this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| And now, all of a sudden, now, during election season, we're ready to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| So for the last and final time, Knoxville, we have three days left on early vote, and 29th is next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| If you won't change, then you're going to have to do one thing and one thing only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| and that is report to the nurse ballot and check Constance Every as mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Or here's my favorite part, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And you can put up with it, continue to put up with the nonsense and the inefficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| and the incompetency of people like India Kankana as your next mayor, if you decide so, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Council, that concludes people who have signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| I just want to start by thanking council, because many may not recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| but two years ago in our retreat, the members of council said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| and it was every single one of us, said that the things we wanted to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| were addressing some of these issues like mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| And we all asked, we said, look, we don't have the biggest purse of all these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| There's Knox County and there's the state, and we need to bring them into this conversation too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| And we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| We did that once with a special workshop that included not only city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| but our county commissioners and the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| And then we did it again on August 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| And in the August 3rd meeting, something really impressive happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| We were sitting there with people who are elected to partisan positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| and every person in the meeting voiced support for what we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| for these items that are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Now, I can understand being skeptical about the political process these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| There's plenty of examples of exactly what we've heard some people talk about that you can draw on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| But in that moment, there was a rising above that political discourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| and we actually saw Democrats and Republicans, and we're nonpartisan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| all in support of these agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| So I'm just very proud of council for your continued leadership in pushing to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| I wanted to mention a few things about the need for the long-term state-funded staffed inpatient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2831)|
| 0:47:21| We have to do more to divert people in crisis away from our judicial system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| and there are lots of programs that we work with county and state on that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| But we have to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| First, it's wrong just on itself that vulnerable people are treated in the way that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| and that they deserve better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Secondly, if you don't think that's wrong, then you should at least think that it's expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| and it's the wrong way to go that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| What we found out in the workshop was that $17,000 a month is spent on mental health medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| at the Knox County Detention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| 585 inmates have diagnosable mental illness, and 52 of those are experiencing serious mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| That's wrong, and everybody in the meeting said that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| We need to do better, and that's why we need these inpatient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Knox County has a high admission rate to the state facility in Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Admissions from surrounding counties that have to send folks to Moccasin Bend drive through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| So we need these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Think of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Somebody who's in a crisis has to travel from wherever they're coming from, even if it's Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| and go into Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| That's counterproductive to their stability, to stabilizing somebody in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| And the other thing is it's removing that person from their network of natural care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| It's also you're asking people who are going into a place who probably already have financial hardships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| their network of support from their family, they can't travel to Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| so you're again removing them from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| That's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| We have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| I was really glad to see that we didn't see partisanship come up in the workshop, or even setting it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2959)|
| 0:49:30| The state partners stayed for about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| They were able to hear most of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| It's too bad they had a conflict that evening, but they came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| and the conversations continue with us moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| I do want to make a few clarifying points because I did have some questions from some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| that wanted to make sure they understood the resolution properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| First, the rapid mobile crisis response is intended to be inclusive of all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| without regard to their insurance status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| The rapid mobile crisis response is not a reference to the currently existing mobile crisis unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| but rather a fast first response for situations that don't require a police presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| Also, the intention of the rapid mobile crisis response is to connect people in need with care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| and the unit is not intended to be able to force hospitalizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| What we're trying to do is add on the disentanglement that goes on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| where we're entangling mental health with the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Like I said at the beginning of this, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| We don't need to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| We need to be doing more things diverting folks away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| like what we have with the BHUC, where we're making progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| We need to be doing more, and that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| These steps will ensure that we can move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| and we know that county commission passed this unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| A board made up of Democrats and Republicans passed this exact language unanimously the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and it's going to be on their consent agenda on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| So my hope is that we can pass this unanimously tonight too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| and finish the beginning steps that we started to take two years ago at that retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Please don't interrupt the business of the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| I have a few questions and comments about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3103)|
| 0:51:54| First, I'll start with comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| My take on the joint workshop was a bit different than yours, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| It did not seem that we had an opportunity to really talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| and express our opinions on what was being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| The presentations ended, and it seemed like attendees of the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3138)|
| 0:52:28| from county commission and city council were ready to suggest perhaps a pre-suggested solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3148)|
| 0:52:38| that they could share, and then all of a sudden it shows up in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| I have the same concerns that I expressed at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| when rapid mobile crisis was lifted up at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| I explained my concerns because mobile crisis is not a nonpolice response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| and that is the language used throughout the state for these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| and there's no definition in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| You offered one verbally, but the definition is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| The other concern that I have is that what it seemed like we were in agreement about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3194)|
| 0:53:25| is the need to move forward with some sort of task force where we could actually review the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3205)|
| 0:53:34| Data coming from the state suggested a few different things to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| and it wasn't clear to me whether other services would address the issues that were being presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3218)|
| 0:53:47| For instance, permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| How many of the folks that we're talking about simply need supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| rather than to be institutionalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| I would hate for us to jump to institutionalizing a portion of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| when they just need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| My other main issue is that we have to ensure that we are pursuing this in a public health approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3248)|
| 0:54:19| I see no mention of that in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| and the comments that I've heard from some county commissioners concern me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| about how they interpret how this potential hospital would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| and how that might be different than our approach as a city that has committed to a public health approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| When I proposed the alternative response team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| it was a solution not to the entire crisis that we're facing as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| but one solution that could chip away, that could provide some relief, some services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3295)|
| 0:55:04| some compassion to members of our community who are underserved and who need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| and who we are currently directing our KPD officers to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| And what has happened is, as members of the public have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| this issue has been muddied unnecessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| Calling for a mental health hospital could be a separate initiative that we could explore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| but tying it to alternative response is unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| Also, alternative response was a solution that had the potential to free up the workload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3345)|
| 0:55:56| not only of our KPD officers, but of the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| So jumping to a need to expand the co-response team without reviewing the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| understanding what calls they would respond to versus an alternative response team seems premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| So I continue to suggest and advocate for a space where we can engage in planning and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3373)|
| 0:56:24| I think a task force would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| But I'm not able to support this resolution at this time because I do believe it is premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and that to ensure that we get the services that we need as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| we have to be very intentional about the language, especially language, going to our state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you. Ms. Parker, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| I'm just going to reiterate a little bit about what Vice Mayor Roberto said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| For me, mental health, substance abuse is like cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| Everybody has either been touched directly or peripherally by both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| It's a heavy lift with a lot of moving parts that requires participation from every level of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| as well as local and regional agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| We didn't get here overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| We're not going to get out of it overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| But steps like the co-responder model are moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| The city is not the cure-all, which is why we must continue to have this conversation and collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3453)|
| 0:57:43| Mr. Johnson, I just want to make sure that my name is added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Ms. Parker? No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Just quickly, I wanted to address the issue of Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| I'm a very, very strong supporter of Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Our sister state of North Carolina, after many years, has finally approved Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| It's something that I would vote in tonight if I had the ability to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| I've lobbied our state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| I've talked personally to one of the governors that was in office during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| But unfortunately, this body doesn't have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| It's been brought up at the joint workshops by either myself or other members of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| when state representatives were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| And it's a very important issue, and I think it would do a lot to, in many areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| mental health and just health in general would be a great improvement to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| And as the gentleman spoke, we're turning down federal money that they're trying to give to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| and we won't take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| But mainly I just wanted to clarify that as much as I would love Medicaid expansion in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| unfortunately myself and this body doesn't have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| And I would encourage you to contact your state officials who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I just want to add a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| One is I think that I'm really happy with the consensus that's made in this between this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| And I don't see any reason that the pieces of this need to move at the same pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| So I think that this is obviously a complicated problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| There are multiple solutions listed within this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| and I think they can take whatever pace they need, some quicker than others, to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| And I think, you know, it's important for the public at least to not look at this in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| I know the mayor's administration has done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| This body has done a lot to provide services, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| We just talked about the Affordable Housing Fund earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| We could go on and on about the things that we do within our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| There's more to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| We'll keep working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| This is an opportunity for, you know, we all get a lot of calls around mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| and homelessness and substance abuse, and a lot of those things are intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| And so we feel the need closest because you're our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| and we're probably easier to approach than your state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| But I just want to plea for the members of the public that care about any of those things I just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| that this is something that you can reference and use to call your state delegation, your representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| Please take this opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| We can't do everything, and I think this is a good step for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| This entire community is taking multiple steps forward by making these asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| We won't get them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| We will get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| But we are constantly inundated by things that we can try to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| This is an opportunity where you can help us choose Knoxville's destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| So I encourage anybody watching this to use this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| and that one that was approved or soon to be approved by county commission to reach out to your state representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| I just want to take a moment to thank those who came and spoke at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| One of the speakers mentioned how frustrating it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| and I just want to echo that sentiment that it's extremely frustrating on all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| And this is why it's so important that we exercise our right to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| because where this starts and where it stops is at the state capitol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| with a lot of the things that we're talking about today as far as Medicaid expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| as far as will we get additional resources, what will those look like, will there be a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| This resolution more than likely will fall on deaf ears, just to be perfectly honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| because what we're experiencing now are people in a special session who are more concerned about silencing the voices of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| and representatives who are standing up and actually taking the risk of being expelled again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| or silenced for the remainder of the session to speak the truth and to stand up for what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| And so it is very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| And, again, I just encourage everyone to please continue to reach out to our state representatives as well as the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3749)|
| 1:02:39| Yes, they were here at the session this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| They were here at the session last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| We saw minimal changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| We did not hear a lot of commitments at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| And so I am going to be very transparent and honest to say that I doubt that they will do anything as it relates to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3773)|
| 1:03:02| However, it doesn't mean that we don't continue to make it be known what we would like to see, what we want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| But it's going to take all of us working together, and the power is in the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| And so I just encourage everyone to please contact their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| If they don't care about children being murdered in schools and being serious about gun safety laws, what is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3797)|
| 1:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Council members, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3812)|

| 1:04:22| 11C is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an interlocal agreement with Knox County to establish the Knoxville-Knox County Office of Housing Stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Council members, there are two people signed up to speak, one in favor, one in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| The first in favor is Bonnie Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| Ms. Graham, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| My name is Bonnie Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| I live at 618 Rockingham Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| I am here tonight with a small delegation from Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Together, we are here on behalf of our larger network of 22 faith congregations made up of more than 10,000 people from across Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3903)|
| 1:05:15| We support Resolution 11C, authorizing the interlocal agreement to create a joint city and county office on housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3915)|
| 1:05:24| This joint work is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| None of our neighbors, like the ones we heard earlier tonight, should struggle to live without a decent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| Yet we know that thousands struggle this very day in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Last year, I met a little boy, a kindergartner, who could not stay awake at school because his family could not afford their housing and had to live in their car instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3939)|
| 1:05:50| This is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Many other people are just scraping by, barely making their housing payments, and fearful that tomorrow they will be out of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3952)|
| 1:06:02| I can't imagine working and successfully raising a family with that fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| In communities that have solved this problem, it has taken a shared vision and a coordinated effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| The creation of the joint office on housing stability is an important step toward an effective coordinated effort here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| We applaud this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| We applaud this important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Justice Knox leaders look forward to working with the new joint office and both our city and county mayors to help jumpstart the coordinated effort to move people from homelessness to housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=3989)|
| 1:06:41| and to breathe renewed, creative energy into the necessary effort of preserving and developing affordable housing for our friends and neighbors at the lowest income level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4001)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| The next person signed up to speak in opposition to this is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Again, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an interlocal agreement with Knox County to establish the Knoxville-Knox County Office of Housing Stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4033)|
| 1:07:23| So what's the planning commission going to do from here on out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| What's going to be their function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Because if there's any disruption in housing, it starts with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| Are you going to change – what is this for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| Truly, what is this for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Are you going to be able to bring in new resources from the federal government, a new HUD program that will end up putting people out of their homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4069)|
| 1:08:05| If you don't have a commitment, if you don't have a sincere commitment to do the right thing based on the rules that are already on the books and you really want to do the right thing, you'll screw it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4085)|
| 1:08:24| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| When a landlord wants to make money and you continually allow him or her to be in the position to raise the cost of living by what they charge for their structure, well, that's instability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4108)|
| 1:08:57| So it doesn't matter what a new commission, joint whatever, comes together and says, OK, we're going to make all these plans and we're going to plan all this housing, we're going to make recommendations, all you do is muddy the waters again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4137)|
| 1:09:17| Quit the cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| Think about the people that you say you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| Think ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Think ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Plan, truly plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Housing stability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| If the planning commission is giving anybody and their mother the ability to do what's been done in the past, I've been before a planning commission and I've made requests on behalf of other folk or on behalf of an organization, primarily a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4184)|
| 1:10:04| I've watched them steal land, literally steal it, and turn it over to people, KCDC, for their purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4204)|
| 1:10:19| And literally it's to keep people on the plantation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| I know y'all don't want to hear talk like that, but that's the way it's going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| You all need to know that and know that we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| Because people are getting to a push-come-to-shove position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4233)|
| 1:10:43| You want to do something interesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Start thinking about community land trusts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Cooperative living models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| Give people the power to determine what their communities and neighborhoods are going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| When you do that, take the pressure off of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| You won't have to go running around trying to raise funds to get elected to an office in which you don't do a damn thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4269)|
| 1:11:19| Members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| I just wanted to ask you all to support this formal creation of this important joint initiative with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| It's a pretty big deal that this is a joint initiative, and I want to thank publicly Mayor Jacobs for joining me to form the Knoxville-Knox County Office of Housing Stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4291)|
| 1:11:42| Because we both recognize that the issues of homelessness and housing affordability don't recognize zip codes, don't recognize city and county boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4302)|
| 1:11:51| And we all know, and we've seen this in other communities, that we can address these issues more successfully when we work together to align resources and to coordinate services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4311)|
| 1:12:03| So under the leadership of Aaron Reid, who is here tonight, this new office will collaborate with a number of different regional partners to develop and implement coordinated systems-level strategies to keep families in their homes and to connect people to housing opportunities and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4323)|
| 1:12:20| So I'd like to thank the team from the city and the county who worked together to develop this interlocal agreement, and especially Aaron Reid and Sean Griffith, who will be the joint office's initial staff as it takes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4340)|
| 1:12:32| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I had a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| First, I'll say I have enjoyed meeting and working with Ms. Aaron Reid and her short time in this position already, so I have good faith in her leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4360)|
| 1:12:55| Of course, when I'm looking at agreements, I'm thinking, you know, what have we put in place for the next person, for the future mayors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4375)|
| 1:13:07| One thing that stands out is the appointment of the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| Do we have another joint operation where the leadership is appointed by both mayors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4394)|
| 1:13:24| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| And what is the process in place if those two mayors disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| We keep working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| So we end up with a vacancy until two mayors agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| Or you just come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| That's one problem or concern that I have, is about the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| The other concern that I have is that there is very little description about the work of this office and how the work will be approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4434)|
| 1:14:12| And we've had some very clear lack of a commitment from Mayor Jacobs specifically and county leadership in pursuing a public health approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4452)|
| 1:14:30| And we, even as a city, I feel have moved further and further away as we are assigning KPD officers to assign folks experiencing homelessness or support folks experiencing homelessness and connecting them with services and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4470)|
| 1:14:48| So that would be one of my questions, is can you describe how, I see mentioned here that there may be bylaws developed, but the bylaws, what's listed here, does not necessarily include like a mission statement for this office or something that grounds it in how it will pursue its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4488)|
| 1:15:16| Is there any clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| I'm going to ask Ms. Reed to come up to the podium and address these questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| And I do appreciate that, but my question is, if Aaron Reed is not here, because Aaron Reed's great, but what if Aaron Reed's not here tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4526)|
| 1:15:37| What do we have in writing that will guide this new office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| Ms. Reed, if you could just state your name and your position for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| Sure. I'm Aaron Reed. I am the Executive Director of the Office of Housing Stability, or hopefully will be soon once it's established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4548)|
| 1:15:58| So I really appreciate this question, because I've had that same question, actually, as we've gone through the process of establishing, of trying to get the office established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4558)|
| 1:16:09| The short answer is, we don't have anything in writing at this moment that defines the approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| Once the office is established, hopefully within the next week, we'll start getting our board constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| At that point, the first thing we need to do is define that vision and mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| And so that's going to be an important first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| The next step is to get a strategic plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| So the way that I would like to get that strategic plan put together is through a public input process, some targeted strategizing with service providers, people on the front lines who are really seeing what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4594)|
| 1:16:49| I want to make a very special effort to hear from Rick Roach, from people in this room who know what the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4609)|
| 1:17:00| I mean, I have my own idea of what the problems are, but maybe it's incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Maybe it's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| We really need to have a public input process for the strategic plan, and I'm committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| And I just want to say that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I just want to piggyback on that with a question and maybe a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| What are some of the most practical gaps you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| You may not have the answers, but what have we been missing as a collective community up until now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| Well, especially over the past few years, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| I mean, that's the biggest single gap that I'm seeing in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| It's a bottleneck across all our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| It's a bottleneck when we're trying to prevent homelessness, when we're trying to prevent evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| It's a bottleneck when we're trying to serve homeless individuals, get them the services they need and get them stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| So absolutely, housing is the biggest single gap that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| I wanted to add another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I mean, we obviously agree with you, given some of the things we've passed over the past couple years and tonight, all of the conversations we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| One of the things that, in addition to housing, that I think is a huge opportunity and the reason that I'm excited about you and this role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| or whoever succeeds you down the road is coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| And I was encouraged to hear that I think it was a one-sentence focus of the organization that specified coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4706)|
| 1:18:36| I've been involved with a lot of agencies across town related to housing and the unhoused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| And we have a lot of the parts and pieces, but the coordination between all the organizations who are doing exhausting, hard, never-ending work is lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4722)|
| 1:18:55| And so it's not for lack of will or effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| And I think I see a lot of faces in here that do this work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| And you are doing the hardest work in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| But the reason that I'm excited about you in this role and this organization is because of that coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| I know firsthand, by name, people who have been served one place and reached a milestone and then ready for the next and then that handoff is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4751)|
| 1:19:25| And I think there's a lot of reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| But these lack of handoffs have names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| We all care about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| But the coordination, we need someone to wake up every day thinking about names and numbers and where things fell through the cracks last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4776)|
| 1:19:48| And I'm involved in a number of organizations, but one of those is Care Cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| And I just want to advocate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| They create a space where hundreds of people come for services weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| And there are very limited opportunities to do the official processes that we do, like CHAMP assessments and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| There are just limited resources and the agencies that are authorized to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| It's all limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| But I would encourage you to focus narrowly, in addition to housing, on the day-to-day finding gaps and fixing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4815)|
| 1:20:27| and specific handoffs between one person succeeds a milestone and another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| I just can't hammer it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| But I just want you to – there's opportunity awaiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| And it requires thought and grit and persistence and unofficial operating hours and somebody that is trying to plug every organization who's exhausted by the work to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4840)|
| 1:20:57| So pick up the point that's in the middle where everybody's too exhausted to hand off and find a way to be the handoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| I'm just begging you because there are a lot of things, as we've discussed tonight, that are outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| And there's a lot of things in Nashville and the county, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| This is within our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| And we can do this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| And I'm asking this organization to be the glue between those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| So thanks for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| And I'm cheering you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| My first question, and if you don't know this, maybe someone else from the Mayor's Administration can jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| So how does this office function with the existing city's office on homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4901)|
| 1:21:52| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| So things are a little up in the air right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| There are always going to be funds that the city administers that touch on homelessness and are meant to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| I honestly don't know the city's plan, whether they're going to keep the office on homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| or whether they will fold it into existing efforts under community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| That's something that we're going to address, hopefully, once the office is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| Mayor, do you guys have any thoughts on that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Of course, we're going to continue to support the Office of Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| and Mike Dunthorne is going to continue doing what he does to administer the HUD grants that come directly to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4948)|
| 1:22:37| And we are going to look forward to having greater coordination and collaboration with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| to address the issues of housing and housing stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| because the best way to address homelessness is to help people avoid getting evicted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| So some of the stuff is stuff that this new entity is going to help us plan for and coordinate going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| But, yeah, we're going to keep what we're doing that's specific to the city and the city only within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| and I'm committed to that 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| But stuff that can and should be a more collaborative and coordinated effort will go in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| I know that we talked specifically about the housing crisis and the housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Do you all anticipate that this particular office that's going to be set up would be privy to emergency housing funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5003)|
| 1:23:34| Because I think that's going to be the immediate thing that it's already out there and it's not going anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| is that we're limited on where people can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| So do we envision having some emergency funds in this office, or is that yet to be determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5023)|
| 1:23:54| I don't know the exact answer to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| but what I do want to say is that the strategic planning process for the Office of Housing Stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| is going to include liaising with the city and county government on how funds are spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| that aren't under the auspices of the new joint office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| It's going to be a way for city and county officials to be able to have a strategic direction for spending those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| whether it's ESG or maybe emergency funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| then that strategic plan will provide guidance to them on how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| We'll look forward to seeing how this goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Yes, Ms. Reed, just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| I appreciate you coming out to North Knoxville about a week or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| and spending a significant amount of time with some people up there that had some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| You answered all the questions well, and that kind of accessibility I think will serve us all well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5092)|

| 1:25:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| 11D is a resolution expressing appreciation to Bird Global Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| for the donation of $100,000 to be used toward the development of bicycle, pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5109)|

| 1:26:44| to take a stand for me for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| Now, as you can see, the community came out to support us because we are the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| and they believe in the work that we're doing and the goals that we're trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| which is to make a safer Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5223)|

| 1:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| So I can start off by saying I'm a man that has made my share of mistakes in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| mistakes that led to prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| It led to me being denied jobs, housing, and all from those mistakes that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| And I'm sorry for being a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| This is kind of new for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| But I spent most of my life outside of that working with youth already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| I worked for Lakeshore Mental Health for about six years working with kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| I worked with Reflections Treatment Center working with kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| For the past 15 years or plus, I've coached youth football dealing with kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| not knowing and not realizing that I was already doing the work that I'm here to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| But as the time I was doing that work, I was doing it without structure and without knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| But now that I'm a part of Turn Up Knox, they're offering a lot of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| We're networking with so many different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| And it's actually giving me the tools that I'm going to need to actually be successful in the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Since being a part of Turn Up Knox, the work has given my life a sort of a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| I've always been compelled to work with kids or help kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| and there's plenty of kids that I've dealt with all over my life that are still in contact with me to this day 20, 25 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| But I just now have a clear picture of what my job is by being a part of Turn Up Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| And the people that I work with, I wouldn't want to do the work with anybody else other than these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| It really has opened doors for me that I always thought was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And being a part of, like I said, Turn Up Knox and meeting new people and networking with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| and learning from different people that's been doing this work has just took me to the next level of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| And I want to continue to be a part of that, and I want to thank everyone that's in attendance tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| because we're all working together to make this same thing happen, which is a safer Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| And I thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5346)|

| 1:29:32| I came into the Turn Up Knox program six months ago with my 14-year-old kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| I reached out, looked for all of the sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| I was recommended to Turn Up Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| I got more from them than I did KPD after my kids were missing for eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| Still nothing from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I spoke with one of the CEOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Within hours, my kid was located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5391)|

| 1:30:02| So I am a single parent of four youth, and I do find that the program is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| The research is great, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5409)|

| 1:30:45| I would like to say thank you not only to the number of city council members who supported this project from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| McCain, her office has been a tremendous help to this program success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| I definitely want to thank her as well. But more importantly, my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| I'm emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| I'm emotional because I'm realizing the amount of passion that it requires to do this work every day, not only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5472)|
| 1:31:24| but to support the continued support that I get from my staff, from community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| You know, when you when you're dealing with families who you see hurt every day from losing certain loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5491)|
| 1:31:40| you know, that that that that grief and hurt is easily transferable when you do have the type of passion that myself and my staff has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| And these are things that we deal with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Again, I want to thank city council for helping me kind of realize that even a small amount of help can go to great measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5513)|
| 1:32:03| You know, when you do have the support from local government and the community, you can take these these these long strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| And, you know, I can say I can honestly admit I didn't expect us to be this far in this first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| I just didn't. I didn't expect the amount of progress that we made in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| I didn't expect it. So, again, I want to thank, you know, my staff and my staff, the community, you know, day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5542)|
| 1:32:31| You know, I get the opportunity and the privilege to watch them build relationships, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| provide a different intervention between community members and certain incidents that included violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| You know, we operate with nine staff, which six of those we rotate for hours on a 24 hour time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| I mean, we we don't stop working. We've been working 24 hours, seven days a week since we started this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| And that's that's what you guys support, the community support. Like I said, long days, random hours in the night, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5577)|
| 1:33:05| spent away from family members. We've got a couple staff who got newborns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| You know, they're getting up one, two in the morning and responding to crime scenes, de-escalate in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| You know, creating and getting in front of rumor control. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| A lot of the times the investigation can be stirred away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| And so we try to get there and support those grieving families who are experiencing a traumatic experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| Obviously, we all know in this room, according to TBI reports, crime is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| We can't argue that. Nobody can argue that with me. Numbers don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| There's no one program that you can pinpoint that to to credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| You know, there's there's not one program that you could credit this progression to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| What I can say is, is that there's been a number of efforts, not only just with turn up knocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| You have drum up, drums up, guns down. You have safe haven. You have love is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| You have YWCA, Helen Ross McNabb, a number of local church clergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| Right. Youth ministry. All of these things have have played a role in some of the progression that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| Of course, we do know that there's more work to do, but crime is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| More importantly, crime is down involving our youth. A 10 year low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| I must say that again. A 10 year low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| You can't you can't stop what God has put in place for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| We look forward to the continued support not only from city council, local government, local agencies, but also to support from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5677)|
| 1:34:45| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| Council members, there are other members of the turn up knock staff and supporters who are available to answer questions should they arise in your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| Now we'll move to the people signed up to speak in opposition to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| First is Rick Roach. Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5706)|
| 1:35:18| Rick Roach, Knoxville. Over a year ago, when the funding first funding came up, there were questions raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5718)|
| 1:35:31| And I've known Denzel and worked with Denzel, worked under Denzel, learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5731)|
| 1:35:41| In those on those occasions, I don't give that to too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5741)|
| 1:35:49| That being said, the questions that were raised over a year ago still have not been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5749)|
| 1:35:59| And looking at some information, budgetary information, we still don't have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5759)|
| 1:36:12| I'm glad everyone has spoken to what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| But Denzel, to be honest, if you know anything about crime statistics, chief, I don't know if you had the department supply them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5778)|
| 1:36:30| But you can arrange those any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| Now, we had a peak two years ago. We had a peak of young black folk being killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5798)|
| 1:36:50| Primarily, most of them in East Knoxville, but we had this rash in a concentrated period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5810)|
| 1:37:02| And we weren't talking about some underlying factors, which the police department hasn't shared or won't give clarification on about the cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5822)|
| 1:37:17| Because all the police do is carry out policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| They enforce policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| Turn up Knox, at the end of the day, can go no further than the policies that the city initiates is going to allow them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5849)|
| 1:37:47| Y'all figure this one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| So we've had people and organizations doing multiple grassroots organizations who get pennies of support from the city government and from the county also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5871)|
| 1:38:08| Pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| And yet we're talking about $450,000 for one organization, which is not a 501c3 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| And there hasn't been any straight up accounting of monies coming into the organization as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5900)|
| 1:38:29| You can access the budget. I've got a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| But when there's some explanation given, and I don't know if you guys have seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5913)|
| 1:38:42| I would reference you for more talking points to an email that you may have received, every one of you on city council and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5922)|
| 1:38:56| that someone, I'm not even going to say the person's name, but you got the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| Look at those talking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| They're very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| They are to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| And you need to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| And when those questions are answered, when those issues are addressed, then maybe we can get support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5954)|
| 1:39:26| I'm going to be honest, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| As much as I like Denzel, Denzel, we still haven't had that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| You promised we haven't even had that phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| You said you wanted something from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| But that goes along with how this council overall has kind of addressed the situation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| It's a problem that you guys really don't want to deal with at the end of the day, because let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| You all are in the business of taking things from people and giving them to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| And that goes back to that policy statement I made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| So just know we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| You need to stop it, and we need to quit playing games with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| The next person signed up to speak is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Ms. Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| My name is Constance Evry, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| So since Rick didn't call the elephant, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| The e-mail was from Reggie Jenkins of Unique Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| So we're going to talk about the voices of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Let's talk about the voices of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| He did send the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| He is a longstanding member of the community who has established a program that has been working with young boys for years is the key word behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| So I'm going to read two things that really sticks out in Reggie's e-mail to me, particularly that we've been brought up, like Rick said, a year ago and still asking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6058)|
| 1:41:07| My second concern evolves around the efficiency of turnip knots past programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| I'm curious to learn if there's any available data that sheds light on the outcomes and the impact of these previous initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Specifically, how do they measure the effectiveness of their interventions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| In my own experience, which I agree to, I've come to understand that addressing crime and violence within marginalized communities require a holistic approach targeting issues such as poverty, housing inefficiencies, educational skill development, and mental health challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6081)|
| 1:41:36| Do you know how turnip knots has tackled these multifaceted issues and integrated them into their strategies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| Are there any financial records to justify such a large infusion of funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Furthermore, I'm left wondering why an organization with no prior experience in violence interruption has been earmarked for such a substantial financial grant, especially in comparison to grassroots organizations that have demonstrated effectiveness over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6105)|
| 1:41:57| Is this a true commitment to curb our city's violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| Well, Reggie, let me go on and answer that question real quick for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| This is nothing more than what it actually really is that we called it for a year ago because we knew election season was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6126)|
| 1:42:13| This is nothing more than coonery for the coons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| Let's just call it for what it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Black faces that have been paid to come into our community to advocate on behalf of India, especially during this time of the year of the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6138)|
| 1:42:27| Let's keep it real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| During the first week of August, eight bodies, eight bodies showed up and we still don't even know what half of those issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| Some have been identified as a murder while others are still under the investigation process of what happened to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| Let's not forget the YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| A youth brought not one but two guns to the center and shot another youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| We still have not had a direct answer what that happened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| Let's not forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| They had one of their own teammates die in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Again, what is the plan to keep that from happening ever again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Let's talk about Bebo's where we still don't know if they are violence interrupters, deputies of the police department or actual snitches for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6177)|
| 1:43:06| But the point is that they were working at Bebo's that had murder incidents occur at the site of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Again, what was the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| More importantly, we've already talked about the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| We can't get an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Are they part of police department or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| We know by your your by your line of line items of your budget that actually we can question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Eighty thousand dollars for an investigation unit directly to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| OK, so either you are or are not working with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| But more importantly, what was the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| We had a recent meeting where we know now indirectly you admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| We're scrapping whatever we did the first year and we're moving to another strategy because we're basically indirectly admitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| What did we do the first year? It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| Now we got to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| And you're bringing in family three to do some data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| Finally, we'll get some numbers to the situation and really see what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| But more importantly, as I've been highlighted, if this was a sincere program, then what are you basing it from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| Is it from Philadelphia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Are we using the models from L.A.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Are we talking about the ones that they do in Miami?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| Are we using the ones from Arizona?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Where are we getting the actual strategies from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Where is the public betting? Because, again, concerts and cookouts and parties are not actual engagements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| Where is our mentorship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Why have we not seen 100 black men work with this program to establish some form of direct mentorship in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| Why have we not had actual town hall meetings like at the Lions House where D.I.C. could easily organize that for the community to come in and talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| Hey, Gwen, six district representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Why have you not called a town hall, right along with your husband, who's a state representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| that we can get the funding directed from the state to also talk about how we're going to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| I need to see sincere transparency and authentic effort behind the gun violence because these children are dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6281)|
| 1:44:49| And last but not least, we still got to address the violence of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| Did everybody see Weston Heights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Did y'all see them girls get slammed not once, not twice, not three times, six times on concrete ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| before there was an actual response in return to the police directly assaulting her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| So we still got to deal with that part. And more importantly, Ms. Bell, we still got an aha like that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| We knew she left on racism. I just think it's ironic how y'all sat here and lied directly to our faces about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| and then found out after the fact that now Paula wants to make a statement about what really occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| So, again, Lisa Edwards, Anthony Thompson Jr., how are we going to prevent those from ever happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| I need to see sincere violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| So, no, people, do not applaud because you don't even know the real issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| And like I said before, this is nothing more than coonery for the coons on behalf of India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Council members, that concludes. People signed up to speak against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| I do believe that the community raises valid questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| And some of those questions were answered in an e-mail this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6353)|
| 1:46:02| I met with Director Middlebrook on Monday and asked for the financial report of last year's activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6362)|
| 1:46:11| And that was shared with us just this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| And I will say, as a nonprofit director, the limited amount of information on this financial report is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6376)|
| 1:46:26| I've never seen it for a grant of $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6386)|
| 1:46:34| So I feel uncomfortable with the level of accountability that we're asking for here when it comes to the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| And it's for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| One reason is because this needs to be a process that informs future policymaking for City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6405)|
| 1:46:56| Turnup not should not be the final solution to how we address the violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| If we see a lack of housing, employment opportunities, those are issues that we have to address additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6421)|
| 1:47:14| in addition to the work of violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| But the data that's in the report is very limited, and I'm not able to pull from this data and understand how much of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6439)|
| 1:47:32| does pertain to a housing issue or a mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| The reports need to be much more thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| My other concern is the amount of funding asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| We're asking for another $450,000, but in the first round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| $90,000 of that went to SEED to, I guess, support their efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6473)|
| 1:48:02| helping Turnup Not with capacity building or whatever that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6482)|
| 1:48:12| That's not continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| And so now that $90,000 will go towards additional staff and additional program expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| There's not anything in this report that indicates a need to increase the amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| This is already an organization that goes outside of our normal policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6511)|
| 1:48:41| when it comes to how much of our funding do we commit to those overhead costs like personnel versus actual program costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6521)|
| 1:48:54| And that's part of the reason why we have community members who are asking these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| because we have community groups who are operating on a shoestring budget, are working extremely hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| who also feel that they are a part of the violence reduction solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| but are not receiving support from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| And we have to be fair and equitable in how we make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| And we have not seen that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| When this program was initially proposed, it was told to me that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| Well, so many things were told to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| But one of the purposes was supposed to be that this would be almost like an umbrella organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| that would be able to grant funding to some of the smaller groups engaged in violence reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| And so that's one piece of the financial report that I was interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6594)|
| 1:50:03| But I'm just not seeing that funding spreading out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| And I even see some discrepancies, which is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| When I spoke with Shore Foundation, they did not recall receiving any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| And they're listed in here as receiving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| So I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| I'm going to need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| I'll come back. Come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| I'm really pleased with their progress and very grateful for Director Middlebrook's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| They are helping reduce the violence in our city, and that is a labor-intensive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| Not so much programs, but being able to get up, go to a crime scene at any time, day or night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| and deescalate, counteract rumors, all those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| And not to do so as a volunteer, but to do so as a paid and well-trained professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| So I'm really grateful for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| And I'm going to let Ms. Middlebrook give a little overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| Before then, I'll go to Councilmember McKenzie to address any more questions or conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| And thank you, everyone, who is invested in this work in any particular way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| that is shown in creating safer communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| And for everyone who has shown up to speak about this issue in one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| seeing that passion really inspires me and shores up why I get up and do this work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| And so thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| Just for some clarity, hopefully, I think it's important to note and understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| first and foremost, that violence interruption street outreach is a very specific work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| Interruption is not necessarily the same specific work as overall prevention and or intervention efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6729)|
| 1:52:18| And while there are definitely aspects of those things that come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| interruption really works to prevent those immediate incidents of violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| to help deescalate particular situations, to engage with individuals in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| to have those real-time interactions that can help prevent incidents of violence from occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| and can prevent conflict from arising and or escalating to the point that it turns to violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6761)|
| 1:52:49| And so it is very different than some of the other programming that we see happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| some of the other really great work that we see happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| It is hyper-specific programming that has a very particular focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| and therefore the way in which that programming is done is going to look very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| As you heard Mr. Grant mention, these are folks who are on call all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| because violence doesn't just happen between 8 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| They need to be able to be responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| The major part of their work involves that engagement, that interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| It's not necessarily from day to day doing specific programming in a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| It's getting out in community, it's engaging with folks, it's attending events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| it's building relationships, it's having conversations, it's deescalating situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| it's ahead of rumor control, and that's people power, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| And so that's why we see a great portion of the budget going to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| because the people is the work. The people is the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| And so that's why that number may seem slightly out of balance from what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| from some of our more traditional nonprofits that are doing direct services and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Also, I know that there have been some concerns raised around the length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| for which the program has existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| And this program came out of a response by folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| I'm happy to see Mr. Canty here and the great work that he's doing with Cities United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| that they led in a meeting here with our community and folks who identified themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| as being really interested in building out this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| And so that's where we started in a community work together to build out with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| The City of Knoxville did not develop this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| Community developed this program, and that's what we see before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| But I think it's important also that we recognize that this is not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6888)|
| 1:54:55| It's a contract for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| And so some of the policies that exist, say, for example, for our community agency grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| and things like that, are not applicable in this particular circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| because this is a contract for services so that we do not staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| We don't do social services here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| We don't staff folks to do this type of work here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| We contract with community partners to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| And so it's a contract for services, not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| And so that's why some of those parameters may look a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| In terms of, you know, as we think about how this organization works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| within partners with other organizations in the pilot year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| there was a lot of discussion about what this programming could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| And I thank you all, and I'm grateful to you all for the faith and the leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| to develop this as it has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| And so in this initial year, what we have seen is for Turnip Knox to help sponsor events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6950)|
| 1:55:58| to help provide resources to other community organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| and try to help meet some of the needs where they may be lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| This year, as they look to continue to build out that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| and as we continue to think about having the need for additional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| and how staff is compensated, as I mentioned, they are working 24 hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| and it's exhaustive work and we don't want people to experience burnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| And so making sure that they can function at a high capacity I think is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| There's also some additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| As you all know, last year this program was incubated within SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| and so when we think about things like insurance, things like rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| they're also adding insurance for their staff, which was not included in last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| Then that absorbs some of the costs that had been going towards SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| that the program is now going to have to absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| And so they're really working hard and diligently to do the work of street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| but that work does not look like a lot of the more traditional work that we see from some of our other programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| because it is so people-centered and it is so focused on that direct engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| So I hope that helps folks kind of understand what the work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| Thank you, Ms. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, LaKenya, for clarifying some questions that I had earlier as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| and sharing those publicly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| I want to say thank you to Turnip Knox staff for the work that you all have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| because it absolutely has to be a passion for the commitment that you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| We may look at that dollar amount that you call payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| but that really doesn't mean a lot when you're talking about people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| especially those that are on 24-hour shifts and on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| We hear a lot about going out to crime scenes, but also the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| And thank you to Ms. Frierson for coming up and sharing with us how Turnip Knox is working with your son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7080)|
| 1:58:08| and your ability, knowing about them, to reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| And we don't hear a lot about that because there are some parents that don't want to share that openly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| the work that people are mentoring with their children because their children have made some decisions that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| you know, got them into some trouble that could eventually lead them down a path of self-destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| or being able to hurt someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| And so I do appreciate you for sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| And I also want to thank all the other nonprofits that are out there in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| There absolutely are a lot of nonprofits out there that have been out there doing the work for a much longer amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7118)|
| 1:58:47| And we can always look for something negative and something to be wrong with each and every nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| but that's not what we're about, and that's not how we build community and we build each other up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| It's about looking for the passion and the good because for every nonprofit that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| there are passionate people who are out there doing the work, and that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| It takes everyone collaboratively working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| There's not just one solution to anything when it comes to violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| when it comes to things that are disruptive, that create violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| But one thing that I do know that does that, especially in our community, are words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| A lot of the things that we saw were young people getting killed and murdered were because of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| Because of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| And so when we are here to talk about how we continue to discourage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| and violence interruption is absolutely different work than a lot of the nonprofits that we see out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| We found out that Turnip Knox has applied for a 501C3 and will become a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| and that will be a different situation and a different scenario once that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| The work that they have done, along with the other nonprofits, has absolutely made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| Numbers don't lie, but we know that numbers can change at any given moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| At any given moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| And so this is why it's so important that we continue to uplift and support not just Turnip Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| but every nonprofit that is out there that's doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| I do want to ask one clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| So, Chief Noel, do you have a contract or do you pay Turnip Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| Turnip Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Denzel, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7239)|
| 2:00:56| I'd like to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Does Turnip Knox receive any monetary dollars from KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| or are you guys in any contract that would make you employees of KPD in any capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| However, my assumption would be that there is a working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| which it has to be for you all to even be able to go out to crime scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| to be able to have access to families and to be able to talk to people in various capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| I also know that there have been some instances where people have reached out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| where there is a potential violent situation where they didn't want to call the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| and you all have responded and gone out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| I would say in that working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| if you ever felt like there was a potential for that violence to escalate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| that you would do what was the right thing or if someone was homicidal or suicidal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| So, again, I just want to reiterate that none of this work is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| Someone mentioned that a member of your staff was murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| I know that a member of your staff lost a family member to violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| and for that my sincere sympathy goes to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| But the work that you do is dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| and so I'm glad to hear that insurance is being included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| because people are putting their lives on the line every day when you are out there in the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| even when you come from the streets and you still live in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| The violence is there, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Bullets don't have eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| And so with that said, I'm continuing to keep you all in my prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| I thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| Mr. Grant, we're just going to go see if you have something to answer her question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Yes, I just want to take a brief moment to make sure that it's on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| and give my staff member here, Rashad Woods, just a brief 60 seconds to explain the importance of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| having an understanding of what Turnip Knox does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| and what that working relationship with KPD looks like, if that's okay, with City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| Council members, everybody okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Can you state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| Rashad Woods, 815 Rapper Place, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Yes, see, we go out into the community every day in these high-risk areas and deal with these high-risk people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| And, like, we've had to kind of deal with a lot of the things that was, one, somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| Amelia Parker commented on a Facebook post and said that we make lists of people's names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| and hand them to the police, give them to Chief Knoll, and then Constance is a constant person with this negative rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7417)|
| 2:03:48| But it makes our job dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Like, we have to go deal with these people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| So I could be taking my family somewhere, or I could be pulling up at a scene, and somebody could really harm me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| Like, that's what makes my job the most dangerous, because at the end of the day, I'm from this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Like, that's the reason why I'm not harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| Like, I can pull up almost anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| Like, I'm not worried about it, aside from somebody saying that put me in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| This is funny to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| This is funny to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| You guys, Mr. Held, let's let Mr. Wood continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| But, like, that's most of our problem is the false narratives and propaganda that's being spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| I mean, probably out of opposition mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| It's just really out of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| But you don't put somebody's life in danger because you oppose something that they're doing to try to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| It really makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| Audience members, please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| We do not hear the person who's addressing counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| Mr. Woods, did you have anything else you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you so much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Well, actually, point of order, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| My name was mentioned, and I would like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| It's Ms. Testerman's turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| You'll get your turn in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| I do have a few questions for Mr. Grant, if he wouldn't mind coming back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7509)|
| 2:05:24| Good evening, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| I'm doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| First, I want to commend you and thank you for the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| Just really some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Do you have any update on the status of your 501c3 and where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| So we've submitted our 501c3 full-length application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| We've been told over the course of, I want to say, about 90 days that it can take anywhere between up to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| And so that's where we're at with our status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| We're literally just waiting for it to come back from the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| So you just applied for it 90 days ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| About March, actually, towards the end of March, we filed our loan form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| So we're still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| So I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| So you had your one-year pilot program, your one-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| I would love to hear a little bit from you on during that one year, and you just said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| you didn't dream you would be kind of this far along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| But what some of your successes and what some of your failures were, and of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| what would you do differently and what do you plan to do differently moving forward from what you've learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| One of the key things we did learn, and, you know, in reference to the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| is understanding the importance of being community informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| I know a lot of the times we can go ahead and put our own agendas on what community members need to get out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7612)|
| 2:07:00| some of the situations that they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| And so we made it a priority going in to spend the majority of the time engaging with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| pretty much to kind of hear what they need, you know, what they want Turnip Knox to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| and modeling our program, you know, with that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| We have found, you know, as many people know, there's a lot of underlining issues that go into violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7639)|
| 2:07:25| Housing, drug abuse, domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| There's a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| And so for us, and I tell my staff this all the time, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| it's easier to give a person a fish as opposed to teach them how to fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| And that's the approach we're taking because we do realize, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| there are a lot of barriers that the, you know, the community are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| And so we're focused more on fixing the underlining issue as opposed to just throwing a Band-Aid on his or her issue that they're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7669)|
| 2:08:00| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| And as well, just kind of, so when you get your 501c3, and, you know, talking about over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7681)|
| 2:08:10| and, you know, honestly, it is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| And over two years, you know, $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| And so I'm just curious to hear from you, you know, what your plans are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| once you get that as far as applying for grants, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| what kind of research has been done to identify what might align with what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| and just sort of how, you know, your goal to, for the organization to achieve, you know, to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7714)|
| 2:08:43| And, you know, be self-sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| You know, sustainability comes with transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| But I've also realized that transparency takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| We are currently in the middle of an audit right now as we speak, which we plan to provide to city council to make public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7734)|
| 2:09:01| to give full disclosure on what the finances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| So that will cover the finance piece from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I've been transparent as far as what staff is going to be paid, what our programming is going to look like, administrative fees, taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| Those things are public knowledge, and I continue to keep it that way to be as transparent as possible for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7756)|
| 2:09:23| and for city council members who may or may not decide if they want to continue this work in the future or support the work in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| My time is running out, but one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| You mentioned several different organizations earlier when you spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| and I would love to hear just a little bit more about the collaboration that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| you have with those agencies that you talked about and sort of what that might look like going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| Partnership was one of the main issues brought up for those who were opposed to this initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| And so I made sure that, you know, us as a program, that we were steadfast with creating different partnerships and collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| I mean, there's a number of individuals and organizations that we partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| Austin East High School, you know, Senior Dudes, Austin East Boys and Girls Basketball Team sponsorships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7806)|
| 2:10:14| Canvas Can Do Miracles, Drums Up, Guns Down, Love is the Answer, Mills Mills Angels, Mothers of Mission Survivors, the Shorer Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7814)|
| 2:10:24| I do have proof that we actually did sponsor a movie appearance for their staff and their entire youth program to attend the Black Panther 2 premiere this past November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7824)|
| 2:10:36| We provided tickets for all the youth to be able to watch that movie for free to give our young men and women, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7836)|
| 2:10:45| majority black but of all color, an opportunity to watch a movie that can inspire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| We have the YWMCA, we have Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| There's been a number, there's a plethora of organizations and individuals that we partner with just in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| And so we want to continue helping and supporting these small groups who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| aren't necessarily in a position to receive this kind of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| but making sure that we kind of set a precedent to be an incubator for some of these small programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| So in the future, they know which direction to go to be able to get these funds, to be able to, you know, progress their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7874)|
| 2:11:22| Thank you for that. Sorry for all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Thank you. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| Yeah, Mr. Grant, I just I don't know that I have that many more questions for you at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| because Councilwoman Testerman asked my question or you answered my question specifically because one of the organizations on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7893)|
| 2:11:43| you were called out for that, but you just answered about the Black Panther premiere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| Yes, ma'am. When this list is done in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| could you just make sure to include another column that gives a little more detail about what the donation was for quantity and what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7909)|
| 2:12:00| I just might make it a little easier to understand. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| And I appreciate you answering that question specifically. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| Vice Mayor Roberto. Mr. Grant, I was going to address you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| So thank you for staying up there so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| I just want you to know that what you and your team does takes courage, real courage to see something that's wrong and to get out there and try to do something to help and lift up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7936)|
| 2:12:32| And that is so important and so needed in the broken world that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| And so I just want to commend you for doing that, doing something, getting up, working, doing the hard work that Turn Up Knox is doing, building relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7959)|
| 2:12:52| That's hard. Getting, you know, any time of the day or night, going out there and trying to address issues that we need addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7972)|
| 2:13:03| to rush to crime scenes, to find yourself in a dangerous situation. That takes real courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| And so I just want you to leave here tonight knowing that this council recognizes the courage that you are displaying and the impact you're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=7991)|
| 2:13:21| And you have my support and I think the support of council tonight. And we want we wish you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| And we are glad to have you as a partner and working on this. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8008)|
| 2:13:37| Council member Parker. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8017)|
| 2:13:44| I have multiple things to to ask questions about and to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| First, I did want to say I'm glad that that issue was brought up because I was not going to bring it up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8031)|
| 2:13:59| The post made on Facebook, I took it down because the bullying that happened on that post until 2 a.m. in the morning was unsightly, unseemly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8039)|
| 2:14:16| It made me nervous and it made me nervous for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| Because even though my language may have been not the best language, because it was a discussion about should our street outreach program engage in group violence intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8061)|
| 2:14:34| Two different strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| And a professional organization should be able to have that conversation without bullying the person who asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8078)|
| 2:14:47| I work for a violence prevention organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| And our folks who are out in the field actually aren't allowed to be on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| And that's one reason why it's not a good idea to do so, especially if you cannot refrain from bullying people on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8095)|
| 2:15:06| I found that very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| As a nonprofit director of a violence prevention organization, I know that for grant funding and to receive financial support from individuals as well as grant funders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8109)|
| 2:15:22| you have to be able to at least report on how your strategies are having an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8122)|
| 2:15:30| And we're not requiring that of turnip knocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| That's what the community is asking for because that's what other community groups are being forced to do for very little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8134)|
| 2:15:46| We're asked to move the 90,000 from SEED that previously went to SEED to other areas of work, including expanding staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8146)|
| 2:15:59| And just to give you all an idea of why that seems unreasonable to me is we started the co-responder program with $95,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8159)|
| 2:16:10| That's not a small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| To not have the detailed report of how the money has been used and will be used, this isn't personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8173)|
| 2:16:20| I have nothing personal against you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| I don't know you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| So I have nothing against you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| But to raise a budget, $90,000, without any accountability for that is difficult for me because we have other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8190)|
| 2:16:45| We have other programs that we need to not only support but help get off of their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| And $90,000 would go a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| I would be much more comfortable if this was for $360,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Audience members, please let a council member speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| Yeah, because I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| But I'll stay around so you can talk to me, but I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| $360,000 would still be a serious amount of money and would allow you all to continue doing exactly what you're doing while fundraising for the additional funding needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8229)|
| 2:17:24| We have in here that $100,000 will be raised, but no idea of, no research, no indication of where that funding will come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8244)|
| 2:17:37| or whether any steps have been taken to identify where that funding would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8257)|
| 2:17:46| I would expect Turnip Knox to have engaged in some individual fundraising by now with the popularity of the program and the support that I see from board members and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8266)|
| 2:18:01| So for our own due diligence, I'm quite amazed that we don't have more information to support an increase in funding for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8281)|
| 2:18:16| Also, finally, there's no mention in these materials of a working relationship with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8296)|
| 2:18:25| Transparency is what you all have to commit to in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| I have to commit to it in my peace organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| Folks want to know exactly how we are carrying out our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Just like we have questions with the co-responder model, we want to make sure that this is truly a street outreach program that is helping interrupt violence and prevent folks from having to have criminal justice system respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8320)|
| 2:18:57| Thank you, Ms. Parker. That's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| I want to, just a couple of brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| I do think there's an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| You have a huge opportunity for the Turnip Knox folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| You have a huge opportunity to continue doing the good work you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| You have an opportunity to quantify that a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| I think I would love to see your reporting as well down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| You've got two years to kind of do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| You've been focused on saving kids' lives, so I get that that's not necessarily the talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| But it's important, so I would ask that you hone in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| I also agree with some of the comments of my colleagues that, you know, pursue grant funding wherever you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8373)|
| 2:19:40| All that to say, I remember very specifically some meetings in this room about two years ago where there were a lot of folks, very passionate and rightly so, demanding this body and everybody involved in any leadership role in the community do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8380)|
| 2:20:00| Because we all remember the kids that were lost on a reoccurring basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| I'll never forget that season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| And so that reporting is important from an oversight standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| But at a human level, this is a small price to pay to not go back there two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| What is the value of some of the kids that are sitting here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| What is their value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| What's their value, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Let's not mess around with the difference between 300,000 and 400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| That doesn't mean we can't overlook specific goals that I think that you all should thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| You all are doing the work that we ask you to do, and with responsibility comes empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| We empowered you before, and we'll continue to empower you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| Please continue to do the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| and have those meetings and have the weeping and the parents before us that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| Not because it's inconvenient, because it's brutal on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| And so please keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| This is us saying you're empowered to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| Fine-tune your craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Get better at it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| I'm grateful for the change, the 10-year low that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| Those numbers can't be promised forever, but they are attributable to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Improve where you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| Yes, I don't want to go back two years ago either, because when we were back two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| people in my community were calling me out to do something about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| and I had long discussions on people's front porches where people, just regular folks up and down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8502)|
| 2:21:50| could come and talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| And what they were telling me is what we were doing was not enough, and it wasn't the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| And what has made me a strong supporter of this particular group is that it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| with what people were telling me on those front porches that we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| This is a different approach, and it has a network that's not so obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| You couldn't put it on a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| But part of the work they do is reaching out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| and having a partnership with regular folks in the community that know the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| and they know what's going on and they know the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| And that's not easy to quantify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| So the only, I guess, to underline the point that I really want to make is that this is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8558)|
| 2:22:46| This approach that our group here today is making is consistent with what I had been hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8566)|
| 2:22:54| And so I want to continue to support it, and it's showing some benefits, and let's give it a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8574)|
| 2:23:03| And it's a new program, and it's a little bit different, but from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| this is the approach that needs to be taken, and it's not being served by some of our nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8589)|
| 2:23:15| who are actually doing excellent work, but we're doing a little bit something different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8595)|
| 2:23:22| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| Ms. Parker, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| I just want to emphasize that's the reason why we need the data and the real reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| because we don't want a repeat of the high level of violence that we've experienced as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| but we have to understand what is contributing to lowering that violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| How much is street outreach a part of the solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| How much are these other strategies that community groups are leading a part of the solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| Perhaps we need to support, you know, turn up knocks at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| and we need to support the other folks at this level to ensure that we continue to see a reduction in the violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| That's not the conversations that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| We're having these unfortunate, really political and quite immature conversations about who do you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8650)|
| 2:24:18| and who do you not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| I'm looking at data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| That's all I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| And what I see in front of us is very insufficient, shockingly insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| And let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| I want the good work that you all are doing to show up on my paper, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| Even the testimony that was shared with us tonight is something that we could have had in our report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| so that we can hear how someone, you know, it's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| That's something that you can do when you write a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| Just put some stories behind these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| Help policymakers understand what's going on in this community so that we can respond appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8696)|
| 2:25:05| If we need to invest in housing in certain areas, if we need more mental health supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| if we need, you know, whatever it is, it's from your work and these reports that we learn what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| I'm not going to be able to support this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| I would love for us to postpone it, give time for the report to be beefed up, have some details put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8723)|
| 2:25:32| get some details clarified in this financial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| But I can tell from the conversation tonight that that's not where we're at as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8737)|
| 2:25:45| But that's not where we're at as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| We haven't really committed to a process where we as policymakers are taking responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| for what we're investing in and what the outcomes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| What we're doing is saying, thank you all for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| If we see the numbers go up, guess who we're blaming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| Y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| And that's not how leadership works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| We should have a clear understanding of what we're investing in and what we're doing as a city to prevent violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| And I don't believe we're doing our due diligence to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| That doesn't mean I don't appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| That doesn't mean I don't appreciate every community member who steps up to do something positive in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| I wish we could give every community group $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| It would be a different city if we were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| But we are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| And so we have to be smart in how we use our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| And it has pained me over this last year to see the grants going to other organizations reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8804)|
| 2:26:53| We're not seeing the level of support for other community organizations that we've seen in previous years even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8813)|
| 2:27:01| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| What will be the consequence of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| What will be the consequence of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| Even our own expert that we've decided to follow, Thomas Ept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| says that for every healthy community organization you have engaged in this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8836)|
| 2:27:23| that represents 1% reduction in violence in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| So if we start to see other community groups fold because they can't find funding and they can't find support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8849)|
| 2:27:36| and I'll tell you, when it comes to community safety, public safety issues, there are not many foundations who fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8856)|
| 2:27:45| My organization, we raise the majority of our money from individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| But other organizations, especially based in a city, look to their city leaders for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| and support for public safety initiatives because there just isn't that much money in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| So we have to be smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| We have to spread it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| And we have to make sure we still haven't gone through the data to make sure that we are addressing this exactly how we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8890)|
| 2:28:18| Do we need to go citywide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| Do we need to have a larger area that we're covering when we think about street outreach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8900)|
| 2:28:29| So lots of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| I just want to say I, too, would like more data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| Everybody would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| You're a startup organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| It takes a little while to get all those policies and procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| I, too, run a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I understand about the scrutiny of people who invest in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| I have every confidence that you will get there with your reporting and your data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8932)|
| 2:29:01| There are a lot of people who support the work that you do, and I'm sure will be willing to help you make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8941)|
| 2:29:09| So I just would say while I, too, would like more, I'm an old financial person, but a startup is a startup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8949)|
| 2:29:18| And I suspect you spent the majority of your time doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| I do think it is probably helpful to now expand some board help or whatever that can help you do some of those other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=8964)|

| 2:37:21| and the MPATH unit that is being constructed at the St. Mary's site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| MPATH stands for Emergency Psychiatric Assessment Treatment and Healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9445)|
| 2:37:31| That facility will be designed to divert persons who have a mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| not necessarily from incarceration but from local emergency rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| to a place that is designed to provide immediate psychiatric care and services with the goal of stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| So thank you for your support of both facilities that are critical in helping some of the most vulnerable in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9466)|
| 2:37:53| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you for those comments on the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| We've heard a lot tonight about being intentional about disentangling those in crisis away from the judicial system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9479)|
| 2:38:07| and this is a great example and a highlight of work that has already taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| where you have the city, the county, and the state working together towards something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| And just to piggyback on what the mayor has said, in the five years that this program has existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| we've diverted over 2,000 individuals away from the judicial system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| and providing them with compassionate community-based care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| That's exactly the kind of things that we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| And so I commend everyone involved with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| and I just wanted to highlight that example of everyone working together with probably some different perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| but finding something that needs to be done in our community and working on it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9529)|
