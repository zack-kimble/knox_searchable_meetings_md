| 0:00:45| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=45)|
| 0:00:55| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=55)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| We will now look at amendments to the agenda, beginning with item 42 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| Are there any deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| We have two items, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| We have two items that have been added, 7 and 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Are there any other items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Yes, just a 30-second commercial on the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Yes, Commissioner Brown, we'll receive that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Well, we got some disturbing news today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| It seems that our illustrious governor chose not to put the money they had promised us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| in for that, but that's not stopping the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| I think we're all pretty much committed to doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| It may mean that everybody else has to step up to the plate, which, by rights, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| look at it from the constitutional standpoint, we should be carrying our own weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| So look forward to more of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| I think we're going to be ready next month to come to the commission with a request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| an RFP to skeletonize it and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| I'd like to add two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| One is on the report out from the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| And then the second one is I'd like to have a discussion item over the letter that several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| commissioners wrote to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| And again, if you want, we can talk about the joint education one today and maybe wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| on to next week to talk about the other one, because it may go longer, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| Your preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Is that your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| We will hear the Joint Education Committee report today and the letter to the state will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| be discussed next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Those are the items that are before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I would like for us to now consider what would be consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I have three items that need to be discussed, that being 43, that's on page 12, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=225)|
| 0:03:54| Next page, 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| Next page, 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Are there other items, my fellow commissioners, that you'd wish to discuss today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=242)|
| 0:04:15| We will then discuss 43, 46, 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| Mr. McKenzie, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| Seeing no other lights, I'll give you another second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=268)|
| 0:04:38| Also we will have line items next week, so I would, if there be no objection, we'll send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| line items to next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Mr. Chairman, since we're only going to discuss three items, I'd like to add a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| item, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| That would be the second discussion item for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| I want to discuss, at the end of the meeting, I'd like to bring up a discussion in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=307)|
| 0:05:16| to the KCDC development board and the past resolution where we gave them the authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| to run the housing in the county as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I want to kind of talk about where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| We may do that next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I may give you, in the discussion, give direction on where I want to go next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| You wish to discuss some points today leading for in-depth discussion next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=334)|
| 0:05:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| We also have some announcements that we may need to discuss later on in the meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=353)|
| 0:06:02| Commissioners, the at-large commissioners night out, also we've had previous discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| of the mayor's budget presentation and a possible special called meeting related to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| Let's put all of those into what we'll call announcements and discussions at the tail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| end of the meeting, if there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| I asked last month about when we should have a called meeting to discuss the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| I think we talked about the 26th, but when I look at TCSA's post-legislative conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=392)|
| 0:06:44| I believe that is on the 26th and 27th, so we do not need to be having a called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| to discuss the budget at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| So if it's agreeable, we will hold that discussion as a discussion item at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=417)|
| 0:07:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I would like to add a discussion item for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Discussion on the Zika and West Nile virus, since we're coming up on mosquito season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| A discussion item for next week on Zika and mosquito season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Zika and West Nile virus, and I think it would be very helpful to have engineering public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| works and the health department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Brad brought up a point about KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| I thought I had the email still on my phone, but back when KCDC and something else emerged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=464)|
| 0:07:57| we were supposed to have a representative on the KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Was that what it was, KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Brad, or was it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| They were supposed to bring into their charter a Knox County mayor's appointment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| Did you get an email on it from both of yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Yeah, I've had some discussion, and so that's the research I'm going to ask the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| office to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Oh, that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=499)|

| 0:08:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| If everyone has cleared their mind, then I would receive a motion that the agenda is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=503)|
| 0:08:35| set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=516)|

| 0:09:58| We have before us then a substitute motion, not a change of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| All in favor of the substitute motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=607)|

| 0:10:45| Is this one, should this one also be no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| I think the developers here, I think we probably, well, they're here if they're, name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=648)|
| 0:11:03| for the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| My name is Joe Petrie, Conversion Properties, Summit 520 West Summit Hill, Suite 903, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| And pause with me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| I'd like to make a motion to send without recommendation so we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| Motion to send no recommendation is what is before us, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| Can I just present the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Well, this is Regas Square, LLC, which is going to be a $36 million, 101 residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| units with about 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| This is in what was the parking lot of the old Regas building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| And the Regas building, as you know, has been sold to Knoxville Leadership Foundation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| a non-profit incubator and their Alliance for Better non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| So we're taking the front of the parking lot from Gay Street to Depot, or from Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| Street along Depot to Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| We'll have 101 residential units, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| The mix is 28 one bedrooms, 64 two bedrooms, and nine three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| And we're providing our own parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So there's a lot of infrastructure involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| We'll dig down one story, put in a parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| By the Downtown Design Review Board guidelines, we have to do retail on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| We should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| We want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| And so we have to provide our parking, our retail, and then we'll have a small parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| lot to the rear as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| What we're asking for, obviously, is a $4.95 million TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| The TIF, as you know, and I sent a letter to all of you last week, hope you got our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| But that's a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| We'll guarantee the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| It's paid back, obviously, by the incremental difference in the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| I thought you might like to know the difference in the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| A TIF, as you know, as opposed to a pilot, a TIF pays taxes the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| The county gets about 23.5% of those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| The city gets about 25% of those taxes, and the remainder of that goes to the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| for the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| So the taxes today in the county are $1,815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| The taxes during the TIF will be $45,741.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| And so that's new taxes of almost $44,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| We'll provide somewhere, it's a bit of a moving target, but somewhere between $4.2 and up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| to $6 million in equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| And if you see our budget, our budget basically, it's a little over an 8.5% return on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=829)|
| 0:14:03| original dollars without a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| With a TIF, what we do is it turns into more of a 17% return, which is not quite to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=845)|
| 0:14:15| risk threshold, but I have partners that want to do this and want to do this for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| community, want to do this to make the urban environment better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| But we have to borrow approximately $2.8 million out of the finished product in a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| loan to get to that profitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| It's just very difficult to do an urban project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| You've got to do a lot of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| You've got to do any number of things that are required by the Downtown Design Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I'm not complaining about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| I was on the committee that created the review guidelines, and then I was on that board for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| But there's a lot of stipulations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We have to do our own parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| We have to do city sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| We do our own stormwater containment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| We do pollution controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| We do traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| We handle those traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| What we've asked the city for is some street lights, and we've asked for some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| rights to the parking under I-40 there, but that can't be designated by the lease that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=920)|
| 0:15:31| they have with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| So we can't do these public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| We can't do the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| We can't, quite frankly, do the project without a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| And so we're asking for that right to borrow that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Sir, please stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| You know, I'm just asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| I'm not intentionally being negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| But at what point does Downtown Knoxville break free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| Seems vibrant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Seems active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Seems a good risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| And this question may be to Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| But at what point do we say, okay, we've done enough here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Because I understand what you're saying as far as tax dollars, but those monies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| you're getting, that 50% that you're getting, those are tax dollars, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| So the taxpayers are paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| So I know we generally talk about TIFs, you're not paying much now, you're going to be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| I don't know, eight times as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| But at some point, I guess I'll say that we kind of need to break off of the bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| You know, at some point we've learned to walk, we're potty trained, and developers, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| take a little risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Let's put the risk in our own pocket, because looking back, other than the S&S Cafeteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| I don't know one that hasn't been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Or, and this is to the city, I guess the county folks, too, why not incentivize, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| going to get a TIF, let's get on with something near and dear to my heart, like Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| okay, we can give you this TIF here, if you do a little something over here to raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| tide and float all these boats around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Because, you know, quite frankly, this is going to be a successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I looked at it, it looks great, it looks absolutely stunning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| I mean, it's going to transform that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| But it, you know, I look at other cities, it can transform the block without, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| county and city dollars, or county, I guess I'm speaking from here, you know, dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| So I guess, at what point do we say, we're good downtown, you know, or we're good residentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| downtown, I'll be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I don't think we're good from a business standpoint, yeah, there can be tips for that, but at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| point do we say we're good as far as allowing taxpayer dollars to go to build residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I can answer my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| When you talk about risk, this is everything I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| So I'm risking everything I have on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| So Commissioner McKenzie, if it was possible another way, then I would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| But it's great to think that, but it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| And it doesn't work that way because we have to do so many things that are requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| in the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| And so this money is borrowed, but it goes back to the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| It's public dollars going to the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| It does help us get the equity to do that, the banks count this as the equity, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| coming out of pocket with a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I don't know anybody that's come out of pocket with that much equity so far in these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| For the last 15, 16 years, I've concentrated on almost solely on downtown through, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| the chair of the Central Business Improvement District, I helped with the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| I've put my heart and soul, my business, into working on downtown projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| And I've gone on the line on anything that I've invested in, I've put our own money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| it, we've taken huge risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| That hasn't always worked out so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| The last TIF that I had was Southeastern Glass, we've come out of pocket on a lot with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| to support that TIF through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| So the guarantee is sometimes invoked, and oftentimes we come out of pocket for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| So we're supporting those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| The reason it's an incentive is because it does pass the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Developers, there's no magic wand to this, we can't do it without the incentive, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| most people would not do it, and as much as I would want to, I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| I've got good partners, we have financial viability, but we just can't do it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| that, and nobody would take this kind of risk with that kind of investment without the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| But you can't, it's not a won't, it's a can't, and that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| Okay, good, I appreciate that, and you have done some outstanding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| So you never would, and when I say you, I'm not talking about you developers, I'm more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| the royal you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| You would never be able to do an urban redevelopment project without a TIF is what you're kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| of saying, or in the foreseeable future, or because of the rates that you charge today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| you can't realize those savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Even with what we think is a pretty good market now, coming through the recession, and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| the market that we are today, we're trying to make this as affordable as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| So our average prices are about $252 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| The real estate folks tell us you've got to be $250 to $275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| If you look at the recent transactions, they're above $300 a square foot for existing space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| The problem is you can't say never, but if you study these things, there's a critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| mass to residential, which we're not really close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| It would probably be more like 5,000 residents in downtown Knoxville to get to the mass that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| you start to have enough for retail on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| So you've got no retail without doing a larger project, so you're sustaining the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| to do retail, which gives you sales tax dollars and regular property tax dollars, by doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| And so what we're all trying to do is get to that critical mass where you can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| someday, but we're just simply not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Knoxville, if you look at projects in like-kind cities like Greenville or Asheville, we couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| compare to Nashville, of course, but those two we can, and there's many new projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| that have started, and we're just on the cusp here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| So it's not that we're asking for free dollars by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| It's the ability to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Now, yeah, those dollars are paid back out of the property taxes, but it's a really fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| system unlike the pilots, and we have used pilots on behalf of our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| We have not for ourselves, but that just lowers your operating costs, where this is a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| which is paid back by the end user, and the county still gets those tax dollars, a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| of those in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| So two quick questions, and then I'll ask Ms. Foss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| One is, how long is a TIF for, and are you, when you say public infrastructure, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| including the parking garage to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Yes, although it'll be for those residents, but we have to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| Yes, so how is that public, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Well, it's private for them, but it's part of the whole public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| We have to do certain, you have to use certain materials, you have to do certain design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| on the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| The reason we have to do that is because we're taking huge risk in an area that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| is in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| And so as much as I care about my friends a couple blocks away, there's a perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| issue, and we have to overcome that, and we're doing that by having secured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Now, the majority of our other parking, well, all of our other parking is not secured in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| We'll rely on the street, we'll rely on the under I-40 parking, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| But we've got to do those things in order to, there's an order to this, and you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| to do certain things to make a sellable project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| And to your point, the reason we're where we are is because these guys had some insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| about buying this to be a connector to north and south, and hopefully east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| And I think we can establish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| You know, our northern border is Magnolia, so we think by doing this, we connect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| parts of what we're calling downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| Our downtown footprint in the CVID is extremely small compared to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And so by broadening that, you broaden those tax dollars, and you broaden the rejuvenation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| that we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| I don't know, was there anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| I think Joe covered it all, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I don't need to speak for the city, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Hey Joe, really my question is, I got a question for Art Cate first, but if Art don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| I may come back to you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Art Cate, just moved, 5525 Lonus Road, Executive Director of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| Hey Art, thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Quick question, the resolution is approving an amendment to the Jackson Depot redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| When did that TIF currently start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| When does it start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| No, when did the TIF area start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| With this amendment, the redevelopment plan, the amendment was to allow for TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| The actual plan was passed, gosh, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Was Jackson Terminal in a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Commissioner, I'm sorry, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Was Jackson Terminal, I mean the depot, the new depot, was it in the TIF district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| is it a TIF project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Jackson Terminal is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| I'm not talking about Jackson Terminal, I'm talking about Old Southern Railway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Oh, the Southern Depot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Is it a TIF project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Southern Depot is, I'm trying to pull up the map in my head, Southern Depot is in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| And so the TIF district...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| But I don't know if the Southern Depot was a project, I'm pretty sure it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| So I guess really my question is, number one, why are we going 20 years on a project that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| you know, it's a relatively small TIF, I mean for a downtown project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| So why are we going 20 years on it and what public improvements do we get that we're TIFing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| The parking garage, I don't buy that as a public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| What a public improvement are we getting for a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| I don't consider this a small TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Well, for instance, Jefferson...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| University Commons and North Shore Town Center, those are big TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Those were large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| This is a large...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| The development cost is, what Joe, $33,000,000 plus $35,000,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| And so this is not a small TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| And I say that because we just passed one for $350,000 roughly for Jeffrey Nash's condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| across from Greyhound Bus Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| But I mean, 20 years is a long time on a small amount of money, a relatively small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| of money on a TIF on a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I mean, this is, you know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| So my question is, why 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| And you know, the North Shore Town Center, we did a slip ramp, we improved intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| outside the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| What are you doing off property that would bring this to public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| The parking garage, I can't buy as a public...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| They can't get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| That's not a public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| You're building in the downtown area knowing that parking is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| So what public fund, what are you doing for public improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Well, we're following the guidelines, which makes you do all these exterior components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| that you have to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| And so, and in that, you have to do city sidewalks, which we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| We think that's a good use of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| We have to use certain materials, certain design to even do a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| It's got to face the street, you've got to have retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| A lot of people have not been doing retail, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| And that's a requirement because it's a good requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| We should be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Commissioner Andrews, to answer your question about the length of the term, it's simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| a product of the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| And so what you do is look at the tax dollars that would be available to support the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| service and then you back into the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| And in my calculations, we needed a 20 year to make that pay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| And so it was, it doesn't, that's just the way the math worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| And so we asked for a 20 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| The last one happened to be, or I guess Rick Dover's Farriot Building was a pilot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| it was a 25 year or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| There's been some precedent for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| In this case, it's what we really felt we needed to make the amortization work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| I don't mean to belittle the public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| We go through a series of meetings with codes, preliminary meetings with all the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Basically we're told what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Now every, you know, the technology corridor is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| And they're, you know, they have to build all brick buildings, you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| So the requirement, I mean, you helped set the standard when you were on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| And so TIFs to me are public improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Now, yes, this is going to improve the public, you know, just similar to the Central and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Willow, the old Big Dons, it's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| But the amount of money and what does the public get for that money other than the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| tax or the property tax collection, I mean, there's got to be something besides a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| that we gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| And I think that's what Sam was kind of alluding to is, I mean, this is probably going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| But what does the public gain, public access, that we spend our $5 million on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Don Michelle Foster, Office of Redevelopment for the City 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| I think Joe had, Mr. Petrie had made a lot of good points in regards to the Regus TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| and moving forward for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Structured parking is a very important component of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| It relieves the stress of parking, as we know, that's a burden to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And so that was a key need for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| Another important that moves the cost so much for this development is the underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| A lot of utilities are being, a lot of electric lines are being put underground to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| more of the streetscape essence that we want to see in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| And this has moved totally out from downtown and moving north and moving toward the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| So that will kind of help Commissioner McKenzie see how we can move toward East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| But utilities are a very important component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Structured parking, as I said, alleviates all that stress from our parking that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| And some of the public parking is available under I-40 and along Gay Street where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| public parking and on-street parking available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| Other than that, the taxes are generated through the debt service that you would get immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| as Mr. Petrie has stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| As said before, our office, we do vet these projects as they come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| This is one that's a 20-year tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| We won't have, I don't think we have any more coming to our desk for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| So you'll probably see some lag in us coming to the table to request a project such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| A lot of times when you have a 20-year tip, that shows the magnitude of the project, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| investment that the city and also you all are making in this development in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| As Commissioner McKenzie said, it's going to be a pretty good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| It's in a redevelopment area that transforms this area and I guess alleviates it from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| such a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I'm not against it, but I think the public requires us to ask pretty tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| All of them, minus S&W, have been successful, and maybe the glass company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| But when you're talking about this is just for that, everything improvements stay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| that piece of property that's privately owned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And so it's very hard to sell to the public when you're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| You're transforming something that was a parking lot that we all utilized when we went to Rega's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| restaurant at the time, and then you're transforming it into a 100-unit condominium or residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| living space with some retail that can allow for some job creation and some vibrancy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| that area along with the other adjacent properties that have already been redeveloped on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| square as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Can I make one comment, Commissioner, about the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| The structured parking is important for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Remember the design guidelines are requiring retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| It's a little risky over there, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Joe hopefully has a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| The structured parking allows the on-street parking to be short-term retail, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| that's something that can't be overlooked, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Well, all of that, you're bringing the parking burden to the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| I mean, there's already parking there, and so I mean, don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| I'm not against your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Residents won't be using those spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| They'll be using the structured parking that the public can't go into that we're helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I'm talking about the on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Their guests will be using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| But I'm not against the project, but I think the people have us to vet the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And building a parking garage is not a public use, unless the public can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| So I'm not against the project, but I think that the 20 years and the lack of surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| public improvement versus our other TIFs, you know, this one is very similar to Big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| Don's for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| It improves the area much, but it's getting to the point where the butt forecont is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| for the developer, not for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Mr. Anders, I would respectfully disagree with that, simply because it doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| without it, and the tax dollars are not there without the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| And so without the incentive, the reason you haven't seen a new project is because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| nobody's been able to do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| We're the first to step up and say we want to do a new, large-scale condo project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| It takes that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| It is a thin margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| You have many friends in the development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| This is a margin most people would not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| But we think long term, we want to do it because we want to own the retail long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| Now we're borrowing $2.8 million after that's done to support the profitability of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| but then we'll have a 20-year loan of $2.8 million after we sell out the whole project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| if we're successful in selling out the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| There are a million ifs with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| It's a huge project, huge risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| And the reason to do it is because it creates progress everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| The return on the investment in downtown has been tremendous, and I commend County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| for supporting that, because it's been a huge difference maker in what we can now do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| and it's raising the bar for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Downtown is everybody's downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| I'm not against your project, but I think it requires tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| I am glad to answer those tough questions, and I appreciate you asking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| What I worry about is that we don't get those questions and don't get to say the real answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| to those questions, because they're valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| How are you doing, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| You sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| You know, the pictures you sent us, it looks like that building is going to be a beautiful edifice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| but I'm kind of on the same page with Commissioner Andrews on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| You've got a whole bunch of people there in the Regus building now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Where are they going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| You took the parking lot out front that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Where are they going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Where are they going to come to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| What about when XYZ, the school system, I know they have events over there in the party room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2181)|
| 0:36:31| whatever you want to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| People come there for events in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Where are they going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Now, if you're going to build a structure that's totally saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| ain't nobody else coming in here but my people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| and you're taking away everybody else's parking, what are they going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Provide bus service to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| How are they going to get to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Where are the people that work in that building going to park in the Regus building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Well, there's plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| There's 400 and some spaces right behind the Regus building under I-40 that the city still has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Well, across Magnolia, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| But they had a parking lot outside their front door that you took away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| But, Commissioner Brown, we're not taking that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| They didn't buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| The partners that I deal with sold that building to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| and they knew what they were getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| They're happy with what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Nobody's taking anything from the Regus building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| We're trying to do a new project on the land that remained after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| They have plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| But for us to be able to sell condos, we have to secure the parking that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| There's no two ways about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| We're one block away from the Mission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I can't believe that Chris would buy just a building with no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| That just boggles my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| No, sir, I'm on one of his boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| That's exactly what he did, and he did that with the intent of using the parking to the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| He knew that he wasn't buying the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Chris is a great friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I'm on his Southeast Housing Foundation board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| He's not at odds with us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| We support his project by being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| All right, so what if Randy or Jeff, John, myself, Ed decide we want to come over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| and shop at one of those stores on the main level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| What are we going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Well, there's public parking along the Gay Street viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| There's parking along Depot in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| We'd like more broader public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| We're supplying some on the little L shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| If you saw the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| In other words, we all can't come at the same time, though, because there ain't enough spaces on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Well, no, I think there's plenty of parking for the retail long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Again, we've got a pathway of sidewalk from our Magnolia entrance to the front of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| So we're not taking parking away from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| We're supplying more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| We're trying to provide secured parking that will enable us to sell those condominiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| in a district that's in a redevelopment district that's kind of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| I wouldn't say it's got a crime problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| but I do admit that it's got a perception problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and we're trying to combat that perception problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| If we're going to sell condominiums in that area, we're going to have to secure our parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| That was just a nonstarter for our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| There was no way to get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| If we could get around that another way, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| But until we change that district, we're stuck with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| So we're trying the best that we can to get around that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| But we're certainly not taking parking away from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Well, there's one thing you're not going to change about that district, and that's CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| They're here until the Lord comes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| They do a great work there, but they've got a lot of people, different varieties and walks and aspects of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| And you either live with it or you don't go near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Well, I think they're our neighbors, and I think we've got to help provide for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| And if you knew anything about my history, you'd see that in my history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| So I believe in CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| I believe in the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| I believe in Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I've worked with two out of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And so we think that's part of the fabric of the neighborhood, but it comes with some conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| some little humps that you've got to get over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| But that's just part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| It's part of the urban fabric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| And for that very reason, Mr. Brown, that's why we've got to secure our parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Let me say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I'm not against your project, but I do want you to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| I mean, I wish there had been an option to where you had the bottom floor was public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| and then you had your private parking up above or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Maybe that's way too expensive, but it just seems like to me it would have been nice to have done something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| because, in my mind, you are creating a parking problem because those guests of the people who are going to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| and the retail and so forth, parking is going to become a problem in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| because of all the building we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| That being said, that was just my comment on your project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| and really this doesn't need a response from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| But I think as we move forward that other people that are listening and will read about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| should know that in the past, for example, the KUB building, how long did it sit there empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| And a property that had been sitting there, this was just a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| It wasn't something that was a blight necessarily on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| So I think anybody out there that's thinking about just bringing more TIFs should think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| am I really improving the neighborhood and making a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| It really has no response needed from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| But this is something all of us as commissioners I think need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| And I'll put the charge out there to Art and Don and the folks from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| whoever you all are working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| To that point, the crafters of TIFs created this vehicle really for, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2528)|
| 0:42:18| it's my opinion, for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| And we're probably a little beyond the razor's edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| But we're close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Again, I'm going to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| But profitability or not, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Because I think if we get too far away from the definition of TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and I'm only here five more months, the next person is going to use this as a benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Okay, you were here on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Now I'm just a little bit beyond the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| You're here just because you're here currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| But if we keep this movement away from the core tenet of what we're doing with TIFs and pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2574)|
| 0:43:04| we're going to find ourselves in no man's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| And I don't like the way this is progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Again, if the numbers don't work, the numbers don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| To be quite honest, from my district, my community, I'm still not seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I keep hearing of that bridge, you know, we got downtown, we got the core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| we're going to start the bridge, we're going to start the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And we bring Big Don, we call that Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| We bring this, we're a block from Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| You know, there's an elephant in the room, and we keep skirting around the elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| The whole point of TIFs is blighted properties, blighted, not on the way to blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| not close to blight, but blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| So, you know, again, you're not going to hear my voice on these many more times, probably no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| It sounds like there are not many coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| But I'll just challenge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Bob, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| I think those folks listening, let's turn this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| And I remember Paul Pinkston, I mean, sitting on the opposite side of the room from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, he would, you think I'm giving you down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Paul would give folks down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| And he was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| And he was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Because the Brad's point, we won, we have to vet these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And then we've got to say, you know, if it doesn't make sense for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| if it gets beyond our core belief of what TIFs are for, I'm sorry, we've got to walk away from this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| And so, you know, I understand the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Trust me, I understand the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| But, you know, what I've seen, minus one, is high risk, pretty darn high reward is what I've seen over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| There is risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| And I understand Southeastern Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| But that's one or two out of 20 or 30 that's been since I've been on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| So, again, just to the commissioners, thank you all for digging in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| I do, you know, seriously, I'm not saying it for any reason, because I think we've got to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| And, you know, Marble Alley, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| And I've been a supporter of Marble Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| But still, you know, let's talk about these pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| I mean, how many more does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| I, too, am going to support this, but I want to say a few things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| I see this as more of an aesthetic project where we're taking pieces of parcels of property and trying to make them look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| And, you know, I do have a problem with the TIF whenever the but-for is the profit margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| And I find that kind of hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I guess we've just got to the point with our restrictions downtown that getting $250 to $300 a square foot, which is by far the highest of anywhere in Knox County, is not profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2738)|
| 0:45:51| And beyond this project, I worry about the parking, too, that we've given a lot of TIFs and PILOT downtown over the last 15, 20 years to try and draw people to our downtown to make it vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2751)|
| 0:46:06| And suddenly we're going to run out of parking for people to come into downtown, and yet those people will still be out in the suburbs with their tax dollars going towards paying for things downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2766)|
| 0:46:18| But I am going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Mr. Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Seeing no further discussion, the motion before us is to move no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Page 14, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, requesting the Knox County Purchasing Director to issue a request for information for electronic voting system for use by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2798)|
| 0:46:50| Subject to the approval of the Public Building Authority, designating Commissioner to work with the Purchasing Director to establish a scope of work and or specifications for the system to be included in this solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2810)|
| 0:47:03| And three, authorizing the Purchasing Director to take all necessary and appropriate steps to select the most responsive system for demonstration to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2823)|
| 0:47:12| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I move that this be sent no recommendation with the name of Commissioner Bussler in the blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| I just say on this one, you know, as a, as a, the Commissioner has probably taken the first vote more than anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| I think this is a solution in dire need of a problem to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| I just don't see where we need this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| And this sounds like we're moving out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| This doesn't read as a study to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So I'll just make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| You know, it sounds like we're going to start soliciting and getting things in house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| I know there's not a budget, but budget cycle is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| So I just say, you know, I think we need to read, think about this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| We're 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| If this was 29 people, I understand a 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| So it's just doesn't seem to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| I don't see what's been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| So that's just my two cents on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| One of the things that we need to look at here is some things about how, you know, things transpire on our days here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2908)|
| 0:48:39| A couple of things it does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| It does do publicly managed requests to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| And we have got out of our line where we say Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| We just got out of the order on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| We also got a machine that rolls all the agendas down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| This new agenda, we can jump specifically to what we're talking about instead of rolling it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| and have a bunch of things on the board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| It also gives us an opportunity to change the name of the motion we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| It also gives us a lot more editing ability while we're on this dais instead of having it rewritten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| and then come back and present it to us at a real, well, at a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| which is what we're getting to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| So we can set the agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| We can make it more efficient, and it can be spoken to much more precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| We can follow our rules more precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I'm not saying we buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I'm saying test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I mean, how are you going to know what's going to happen if you don't test it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And so that's all I'm asking for this commission to do is to test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| It's not costing us anything to test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| It's for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| With the name of Commissioner Bussler in the blank, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| We are now down to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| This is the first discussion item, the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| We met on April the 7th at the Andrew Johnson School Board building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| and we primarily focused our attention to two subjects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| and one I'll spend a little more time on than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| The second one was the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| You know, you all have seen or are going to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| so I won't spend a lot of time on that, but it's $453 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| It's up 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| But there's been a lot of takes and puts as far as the budget goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| so I'll encourage you all to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and set up some times with the superintendent and his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| if you have additional questions on the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| and how they arrived at the things that they funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| Spent a majority of the time on a, you know, really neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| and much needed topic both in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| We focused on the county with Cindy Piak on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| We talked a lot about the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| and the ways to get sidewalks to the areas that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| You know, she's done a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and been in charge of a significant project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| to kind of look at the amount of walking trips per school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| She did it for the entire school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| and then just pulled out the county's numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| and just to try to get a fair and balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| and equitable way of seeing which ones we need to focus on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| And, you know, they take things like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| traffic patterns, size of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| So it was a really well-thought-out way of going about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| She, of course, contracted through a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| I forgot the name of the outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| But she has, they have engineering maps for each of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| And I'm going to ask Brad and Jeff to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| That talks about how many kids are in a parental zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| and how you calculate that parental responsibility zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| is interesting in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| And, you know, how many are economically disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| how many are really walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| So it was a really good talk, had a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| So I'd encourage everyone to, you can see my packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Brad, I think, and Jeff has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| There's probably one for Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| And I'll talk with Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| She'll be able to walk you through it in as much detail as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| But it was a really good topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Do you all have anything you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| I just think Dr. McIntyre was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and Bob Thomas wanted us to emphasize that they're available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| for individual meetings with your school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| And I would take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| He just wanted us to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| But other than that, no, it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Anything else, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| No, I don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| And the last thing, the last topic that we talked about was our meeting schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| and how much do we want to meet as a joint committee over these next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| So we have decided to keep the meeting for May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| even though it may come a little bit before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| depending on what we're talking about, the mayor's presentation and the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| It may come a little bit before, a little bit after the actual budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| But, you know, if there's any feedback from us, to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| about how much more you want us to meet between later in the spring and summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| we're kind of joint committee, you know, to discuss things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| but we serve at the pleasure of this body and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| So if there's any input you all have on how much more you want us to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| or topics you want us to engage to kind of get the school board's point of view on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| just let any of the board members know, Charles Bustler, Brad Andrews, Jeff Hornby, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| So once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| We meet the first Thursday in each month at 4.30 at A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for your report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| and for the participation of the other commissioners on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| I believe the next item for discussion that we had would be around the budget hearings approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| The mayor will be presenting the budget May the 9th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3331)|
| 0:55:44| May the 9th at 9 a.m. in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| One of our previous discussions had been to have a special called meeting May the 26th to consider the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3349)|
| 0:55:59| And as I said previously, that is a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| The TCSA post-legislative conference is being held that weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| and would conflict for the two commissioners, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| At least one commissioner, I know, is wanting to attend that session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| So that would be a conflict with that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Let me offer this for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| Our work session is the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| May the 16th at 5 p.m. is our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| I would propose that we have a public hearing for the budget on that same date at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| We had talked about before having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Now, is that what you're considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| The public hearing will be at 4 p.m. May the 16th, 4 p.m., the hour before our work session that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3410)|
| 0:57:01| And then I would propose that the budget be a regular item to be included in the agenda of our May 23rd regular monthly meeting of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3421)|
| 0:57:14| You mean for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| What date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| I'm proposing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| I would appreciate having to come down here one day a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| but I would propose that us stop our work session and have it in the later time if the public wanted to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| like a 6.30 or a 7.00 of work session day instead of 4 o'clock because you're eliminating virtually half the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| That's a good consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Let me offer this, that we have two considerations for public hearing, one beginning at 4 and ending at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3467)|
| 0:57:57| having our work session at 5 and recommencing at 6 p.m. with public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| The reason being is at 4 p.m. we could hear from those that are on the clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and as you've proposed, at 6 we could hear from those that are a member of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| I would do 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| 6.30 would be fine with me if that's what we want to say, 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| But you see my consideration is to allow the employees that we can sit two different sessions of public hearing on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3501)|
| 0:58:34| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| I would call the first one a budget workshop and the second one a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| What was the date you set to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Now then to back up and recap all of this, the mayor will present the budget May the 9th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3527)|
| 0:58:57| On May the 16th, also a Monday, at 4 p.m. we will have a workshop on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3537)|
| 0:59:07| Our regular work session that day, May the 16th, is at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| We will have a public hearing on the budget at 6.30 on May the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3554)|
| 0:59:25| and the budget for Knox County will be included in the regular monthly session of May, May the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3565)|
| 0:59:37| If there be no objection, that will be our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| If not enough people are ready to vote on the budget, you can always schedule after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| If something needs to happen, we then have a whole month from the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| If it starts July the 1st, I wouldn't go that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| I was counting all the way until the 1st of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| If there be no objection, that will be our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Do we have other discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| The KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Some time ago, and I don't know exactly when it was, and Mr. Cade, I haven't spoken to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| so I'm just going to ask the law director to research the resolution where we folded the Knox County Housing Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| or whatever it was called, into KCDC and research and see if there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| we would ask KCDC to place some county folks or county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| I don't know if we did or not, but if we did, we need to proceed with getting their charter changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| It's in, from what Bo Pierce said, it's in the agreement that we did at that time that we would have a commissioner on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3655)|
| 1:01:07| I think, will you look at that and maybe even research the discussion on the audio of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| Because I think the legislative intent was there, but I don't know if it's written there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So just research if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I think it would be important for our, and it's nothing that the city or KCDC, Art, do you have anything you want to, you moved down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| Contrary to some of the discussion, the issue was never raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| and I'd be very surprised if the attorney found anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| It was an acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| We took over the assets and liabilities of the Knox County Housing Authority at the request of HUD primarily and in request of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| A friendly acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Yeah, it was very well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| It's worked out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| It's worked out very well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| And I don't know that anyone would be opposed to Knox County representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| Right now, for those who may not know, we have a seven-member board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| One of those commissioners is a resident commissioner, and that's a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| The other six are five-year terms appointed by the mayor of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Under state law, and this is iffy, Mark Mamentoff is our attorney, and we've looked at this just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3736)|
| 1:02:27| Still under the opinion that the commissioners have to live in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| That does limit who can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| Sam, are there county residents inside the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| That issue could, should, could be resolved, but I think that obviously it's a topic for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Come on back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| So, you know, I kind of remember when this happened, and Bo was really trying to get out the business, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| I mean, I hate to put it that way, but they were kind of struggling with their management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| and you all were a good organization to be folded into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| What percentage are those units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| How many units did the county bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| I know it's a tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| There's two developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| When we took it over, there was Bakertown Apartments and Virginia Walker Apartments, one off of Bakertown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| one off of Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| We spent a lot of money putting them back into shape and renamed Virginia Walker to Autumn's Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| and renamed Bakertown to Nature's Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| When we took them over, they were half empty, 197 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Now they're 100% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| We've just converted, as some of the county folks know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| we've just converted those properties from public housing to project-based rental assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| which improves the revenue stream going forward, and it's a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| That conversion actually took place effective April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| It's our first conversion from public housing to project-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Five points, we're doing the same thing as we develop five points and several other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| I guess my concern with us asking for this, one, are we talking about an additional board member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| Then we've gone even now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So if we do that, that's kind of problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| And then, two, if we're asking for, to your point, if we're asking for a city person, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3871)|
| 1:04:42| and I'll be interested to see when we pull out, when we do the research, what was the commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and then what was the intent of the commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| But you're absolutely right, Brad, every person on that board is a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| I'm sorry I didn't answer your question fully, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| We have 3525 units, and so the county is 197 of that 3525.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| Yeah, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| So the point is, I mean, we, you know, in terms of, I don't even think we're one-sixth of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| I don't think we gave one-sixth of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Now, if we wrote it down and committed to it, I'm all for doing that investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| but I just don't see where, you know, if you look at what all KCDC does and what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| it is primarily, you know, I'm a city guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Well, I think they're about to consider a project inside the county that's fairly significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Not large, but a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| So, I mean, it's not going to stay inside the city limits, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| But I appreciate the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| I just thought we had that in the discussion, and a constituent asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| and I'm bringing it, and that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| So I think the work's been phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| You notice I've been quiet until I've been asked today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| You've got your device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| You have a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| He knows something's going on because he's got his device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Seven and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| You know, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Somewhere, and when you're old you lose track of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| but some five years or so ago, whenever this merger took place, between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3978)|
| 1:06:30| I think it was official April the 1st of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| So it's five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| All of us were called to a joint meeting with Alvin Nance and Bo Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| I don't know if you all remember going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| At that time, this is what we were told, that there would be a representation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Now, I don't remember whether we came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| and did anything at the commission meeting after that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| but I do remember sitting down and talking with those two gentlemen that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| and that was what was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| So, you know, and as Brad says, we're going to be having more units in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| and I think that certainly this body needs to be represented on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I just want to remind everybody tomorrow night we're having out at Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| We have Halls Outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| How is this connected to KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| I don't know, but I wanted to mention this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Before you got away and you said adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| We're now down to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| I thought you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I thought you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Have we resolved another problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| I'm ready to get out of your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| There's some senior housing in Halls or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| All right, you could probably leave now, I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned that to where you can come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| and if Bob and Ed will show up, they'll show you how to eat pies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| and Mr. McKenzie, I'll tell you what, come out there and have some pie with us tomorrow night, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| At 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| No spoon, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| You have to eat it with your hands behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| I'm sorry I did not mean to pick on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| We are in announcements, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Did we finish with KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| We must have just chopped that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| I didn't hear an ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| On KCDC, the law director will give his opinion of the research at our meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4114)|
| 1:08:44| Continuing with announcements, this coming Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| the Development Corporation will meet at 7.30 a.m., 7.30 a.m., Thursday, April the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4131)|
| 1:09:01| And as always, I want you to know if there's any questions you have of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| Of the Development Corporation, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| The Development Corporation had this past Monday a presentation on the Midway development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4155)|

| 1:09:55| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| Yes, going back to what Charlie was saying, the Ed and Bob monthly get-together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| we canceled it so we would not compete with halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| but we will be there and I understand that we've been entered into the pieting contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| No hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| With your hands behind your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| I think Ed almost won that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| He was hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Another announcement on Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| we're going to what we talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| a recognition of the Knox County school bus drivers that have been doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| Five of the first recipients will be presented at 11 o'clock this Wednesday at the sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| which is Ted Russell Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| We'll have school board members there and any of you all that can attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| we'd like to have you there as well, as well as the superintendent and possibly the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| It will be at 11 o'clock, Ted Russell Ford, Kingston Pike at Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| The five selected bus drivers are going to get a certificate of recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| each $100 check from Andy White of Ted Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I talked to all five of these bus drivers and they were shocked, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| One called me back to make sure it wasn't a joke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| and another one said that she was thinking about quitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| but she thought she might stay and come back again next year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| So my point is we just need to recognize some of the people that are really doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| 11 o'clock Wednesday morning, if you can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| And then I have one, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| I would just like to say that to live in East Tennessee the last weekend was an amazing place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| with everything that was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| with the air show that came in, with the UT Orange and White game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| I think Bob did the Rossini Festival, the Vestal Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| That's next week, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| That's next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Earth Day, that was this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| We had Rhythm and Blues the week before, or Blooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| I guess what I'm getting at is there was a time when I was young that I would have never thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| that you could have that many events going on in Knox County and be able to support them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| I think there's a lot to be said about our tourism and draw here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| and I think there's ways that we can get more out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| because I think last weekend showed that a lot of people are willing to come here for a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| The air show was also my last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160418?start=4347)|
