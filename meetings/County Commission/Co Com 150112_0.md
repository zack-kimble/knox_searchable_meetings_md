| 0:00:00| I'm going to go ahead and call the meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| And what we're going to do, I guess, unless there's an objection from any of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=6)|
| 0:00:09| what we'll do is, as we have in previous appointments, we will call the candidates up, five, six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=9)|
| 0:00:17| minutes each, and then we will allow for questions after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| So let's put it at five, preliminary, we'll do it in alphabetical order, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=22)|
| 0:00:27| how Jolie has it, and then we will allow time for questions, answers, anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=27)|
| 0:00:34| you guys want to ask of the candidates, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| Commissioner McKenzie should be here as soon as he leaves his doctor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| And so he did email me yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Is there any questions about the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| And when we go into the nominations, I have spoken with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| There was a question I had of the law director, can one person nominate everybody on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| And the answer to that is it's a violation of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| And so we'll go through and nominate individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| I think there's a few people that feel it would be fair that if everybody had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| to be nominated, it would be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| But again, that's just opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Alright, we'll start with the, in alphabetical order, like I said, Tamara Boyer, if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| come down, just give us an introduction, five minutes, and then we'll take questions from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| So, Ms. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Hello, and thank you for the opportunity to come before you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| I'm seeking your support as the next representative of the citizens of the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| When I thought about what would be most important to convey to you about myself in a few short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| minutes for such an important decision, I probably prepared at least three rewrites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| trying to condense for you a lifetime of qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| My education, experiences, challenges, accomplishments, and personal goals, including one, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| being filled here today, because this is a door I have been walking toward for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| and am now finally opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| So I threw those rewrites away because they were really just a regurgitation of my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| And in the process of this whirlwind campaign, I discovered the real reason why I should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| be chosen to sit next to you, and I found it in the words of those who wrote letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| to you on my behalf and to those who wrote letters to me of excitement and encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| So instead of telling you what I think about me, I will highlight the words written by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| Tamara has been a tireless advocate for the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| She is intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate, and principled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| She has distinguished herself as a visionary leader with creative solutions and a passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| for serving others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| She has the proven ability to plan for the future while effectively managing the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| I'm in continual awe of her innate leadership skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| Tamara is diplomatic and brings a level of professionalism in all she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| She is dedicated to everything she undertakes and has the intelligence and ability to unite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| which make her an excellent commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Tamara is the unique combination of receptive, compassionate, while also having both analytical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| and business savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Tamara is rare in that she is an active listener, a critical thinker, and an exceptional problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| solver, all while having the ability to build consensus in relationships for the best outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| She is a talented problem solver, an exceptionally good listener, straightforward, well-spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| and extremely personable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Tamara is a woman of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| She has the highest ethical standards and has been both an exemplary role model and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| an effective mentor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And apparently cannot use the iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Tamara has the legal and financial acumen necessary to make objective decisions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Tamara takes on everything she does with energy, enthusiasm, and optimism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| She is organized and has the ability to prioritize and sees projects through to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| She can work through the most complicated of issues while staying positive, building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| consensus, and treating others with dignity and respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| To say the last few weeks have been a whirlwind would be an understatement, and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| reminded me of my first full-time job right out of college before I started law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| I worked as an AA, an administrative aide, to a United States senator for the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| The number one word they would use to describe me was resourceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| I never knew what was going to be on the other end of that ringing phone, what a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| was going to ask or say, and still, I never felt overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| All I knew was that I had a job to do, to listen, be resourceful, and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| One example which keeps coming to mind was a father who had called, needing to help get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| arm braces for his child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| I don't remember the particulars about the disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| All I knew was that there was a dad on the phone calling for help for his child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| And in about a millisecond, I knew I had to get a hold of my uncle in Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| He and my aunt had no children, but they had dedicated their after-work hours to the Shriners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| Hospitals for burned children and for crippled children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Needless to say, the braces got to that family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| I recognize that there is not a one-size-fits-all answer for every issue that comes before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| commission or for every request a constituent may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| There are short and long-term critical needs for our community, just like there are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| families, just on a different scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| This commission has the ability to implement those solutions for this community's tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I would like to contribute my well-rounded set of exemplified leadership skills, humble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| service, and proven resourcefulness to effect that positive change and impact those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| at the heart of families and our community for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| At every turn in this race, I only became more and more excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| to represent and serve the 5th District and to work together to serve the entire Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| My name is Tamara Boyer, and I ask for your vote as the next County Commissioner for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| I've got a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Bring your mic down there, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I've already checked everybody's voting history right here, but I just want to know, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| know what precinct you vote in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| The 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| That's the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| I'm in the Farragut Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| I mean, I vote at the Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| And do you know the parameters of what your district is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| We're all the way from Pellissippi Parkway and Kingston Pike towards the river and Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| And then a little finger goes down Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| And that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Yeah, I've just got a quick question I thought I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Since Knox County Schools is such a big part of our discussion, it seems like, do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| any thoughts on how you think the Knox County School System is performing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| I have thoughts about our wonderful teachers and our students who I support immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| I support our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I support a fiscally responsible run school system, as I would anything that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| oversees as far as what's within our parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| I would take very seriously the entire budget, including the school system, if I were so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| honored to be able to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| But you could definitely count me as a supporter of schools and students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| It's where I've dedicated my spare time, my avocation in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| And no matter how fine-tuned a budget is looked at, it can be gone through again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| And as I said, that goes for the family budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| And it certainly has to be that way with the Knox County School System budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Next on the list is J. Kelly Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=510)|
| 0:08:38| Good afternoon, Chairman Anders and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| I'm applying for this position because something my dad taught me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| It's always leave a place better than you found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| That thought continues to drive my community service to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| My wife and I are longtime 5th District residents, and we've seen a lot of changes in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| Our district is growing and growing fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| It's important to have responsible development that takes into consideration the community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| and also has an eye to bringing in good quality jobs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| And I believe the 5th District can grow while staying true to its character at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| The 5th District is a growing population that is heavily reliant on Farragut schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| but there are other areas that are underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| I know it's outside the district, but I believe a new middle school in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| could take overcrowding pressure off of other 5th District middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| But we also need to keep more money in our classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| plus keep updating the technology at all of our county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| Now with growth, traffic is always a big concern and a complex problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| but there are simple solutions we can try, such as getting traffic signals on a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| that creates a smoother traffic flow during peak times, such as rush hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| Overall, my broad base of experiences with service at my church, my homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| the community at large, and my real estate career, I believe makes me the best candidate for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| Especially with real estate, I've gotten to know the 5th District over many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| and have heard from the residents and business owners alike what they're really concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| what they really want, and what they really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| And I hope I can have the chance to address those concerns by serving on the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you. If you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Anyone? Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Do you know how many precincts there are in the 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| I believe six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I'm going to mention three words. Which one would be the most important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I'm going to mention three words. Tell me which one is the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| Growth, taxes, and better schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| Well, growth would go ahead and help fund better schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| I understand from having looked over the budget and having met with Finance Director Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| that the school budget is essentially dictated by the state, which is 62%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| But if we can grow the property or the sales tax, that, of course, would help fund the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=717)|
| 0:12:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you, Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=730)|

| 0:12:14| David Freeman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| I moved to Knoxville in 1998 from a small town near Kansas City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| I live in Farragut, and we love our neighborhood, and we love East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| I've been married for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| I'm involved with the Chamber of Commerce on the Transportation Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| I'm a member of the East Tennessee Freight Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| which is charged with setting Tennessee's freight transportation priorities as required by Map 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| I'm a past Sugarwood Homeowners Association president and treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| I've been on the board three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I'm a member of Rotary Club of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| and I'm board of directors of the Truckload Carriers Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| and the leading truckload carrier advocacy group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| My business background is included in my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| The past 15 years, I've been a partner in a successful investment banking firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| leading motor carrier and logistic firm mergers transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| As I see it, the leading Knox County government goals are keeping Knox County competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| in economic development and job creation by keeping taxes competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| Knox County is in a competitive battle to ensure our county is attractive to new business and to new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| If our taxes are higher than other counties, we are not going to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Also, continue Knox County's debt reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Our debt per capita is higher than other counties like Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| Large debt balances negatively impact the county's ability to invest in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| We need to develop and maintain community amenities, keep Knox County as a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| ensure development and neighborhood needs are balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| I don't believe a small number of individuals should kill a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| but I do not believe spatial interest should run roughshod over community interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| Balance is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| For our community business development, we need highways and rail transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| local access roads, an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| We do have the opportunity to fill a large number of vacant industrial park buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| and power and broadband technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Long-term business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Have a business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| We need to identify what meets the county's needs and identify our resources such as labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| the cost of living and infrastructure, fill our vacant business facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| and plan to develop resources into an attractive package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| and support an appropriate agency to market the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Building better outcomes for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| To achieve accountability and performance in student-teacher needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| I support more decision-making and responsibility being placed in the individual school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| versus centralized control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| In the fifth county, I want to continue to improve our business environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| and to work on traffic flows such as North Shore and Virtue Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| I have worked my career leading business development and growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| The past 15 years, I've worked with business owners to merge firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| Our job is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Your job is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| The process has resulted in a great number of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| You have to select the candidate that will bring the most value to the county and to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| I attempt to contact each one and express my opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| I believe the opening needs an individual that has this lead private business as an entrepreneur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| growing businesses and creating jobs, managing expenses, setting budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| and making a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| That's my life, and I'm the person that can bring that to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Any questions of Mr. Freeman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| I can't believe you're not asking any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| You picked all the good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Next is Mike Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1015)|
| 0:17:09| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| The first thing I want to say is that we've had a fantastic group of applicants for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| and I don't think there's a bad choice in the bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I think whoever's chosen is going to do a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| There are really two reasons I put my name in for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| the first one being that I think part of commission's job is to poke, probe and challenge the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| when it comes to things like budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| For everything we do or don't do, there's always an opportunity cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| In our particular case today, we have a populist mayor who's not for any new taxes, who wants to reduce debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| who's not for borrowing new money, and that's a very valid position, but there's also another side of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1070)|
| 0:17:59| Sometimes it does make sense to invest as long as you're investing smartly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| and I think part of commission's job is whatever position Mayor Burchett takes on investing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| whether you do it or don't do it, I think part of the job is to question him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| and make sure his position is thought through and that it makes sense and that it's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| If nothing else, I think the public debate would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| And the one thing I'll say about that is I agree with a lot of what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| but 15 years ago if Hamilton County and the city of Chattanooga had been run like Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| do any of you think there would be a Volkswagen factory there today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| The other thing is I'm probably the only person crazy enough to say this in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| but I do think in the long term it will make sense to consolidate the city of Knoxville and Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| When you strip out the schools and you just look at the operating budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| you have about $400 million, maybe slightly overspending if you combine the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| There is duplication in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I don't think anyone would argue that there's not duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| I'm not sure we know how much the duplication is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| You know, we have two mayors, we have a city council, we have a county commission, we have finance directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| What I would propose at this point, and I know consolidation has been very tricky politically around here for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| and I'm not sure anyone really knows how much the duplication is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| I would propose an independent third-party study to come up with a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| so that we can have a serious debate in Knox County and the city of Knoxville about whether it makes sense to combine the two governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Any questions of Mr. Manning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1186)|

| 0:21:04| I've donated to build the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| I've formed the Tennessee Tip-Off Club for UT, which is now the Big Orange Tip-Off Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1268)|

| 0:21:33| When you go downtown and you have to be there at 630 in the morning, that's volunteering is what I look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| I've been United Way, volunteer ministry, the Empty Stocking Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1299)|

| 0:22:09| I was on the Visual Resources Review Board and appointed by Ralph McGill, the current mayor, for the Municipal Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1329)|
| 0:22:19| I have participated for 22 years, 8,030 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| It's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| And at the end of this day, in the 8,029 days that have come before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| I have given my all for Knox County and Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1358)|

| 0:22:57| You going to tell him how many voters are in your precinct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| No, I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1379)|

| 0:23:25| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| I'm John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I've had the desire to be a Knox County commissioner for 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| I've lived in the 5th District for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| I understand the role of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I know the county departments, and I know the staff, and I'm prepared to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I have read the Knox County charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| I have read the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| I know what the tax rate is, and I know what our debt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| I understand the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| I support responsible growth and sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| I understand what the capital improvement plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| I understand land use regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| I even know what the application fee is for a Knox County beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| Twice I've taken the oath to obey and defend the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| When the county commission or the county mayor or MPC or the sheriff have asked me to volunteer my time in service to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1472)|
| 0:24:43| my answer has always been yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I have represented the 5th District on boards, panels, committees, focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| and I've participated in corridor studies, sector plans, and road expansion forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| While representing the 5th District on the Knox County Board of Zoning and Appeals for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| I've presided over hundreds of zoning variance requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| Many of those requests were from new businesses who wanted to locate in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| If my fellow board members and I had not granted those variances, many of those businesses would have moved elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1522)|
| 0:25:31| As a result of our actions, we've allowed new job opportunities were created for not only carpenters and plumbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1531)|
| 0:25:40| and electricians and architects and engineers, but also real estate agents and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1540)|
| 0:25:49| As a result of volunteering thousands of hours in service to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| I have been receiving hands-on training for this job as county commissioner for the past 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| For the next 20 months, the citizens of the 5th District deserve a representative who will be accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| accountable, informed, and willing to dedicate the time necessary to perform those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| I am that person. I will work hard for all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Today I ask for your vote for John Schoonmaker. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And I'll reserve the balance of my time for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Any questions of Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Mr. Bussler, if you checked my voting record, I've been voting for 30 years as a Republican in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| and my precinct is 65, and there are four precincts in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| One's at A.L. Lotz, two are at Farragut High School, and one is at Farragut Middle School, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Yeah, everybody else touched on the schools, and I just wanted you to, just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| since we do spend so much time talking about the schools here, what is your, in one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| your state of the state of the schools in your humble opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Well, I think they have some opportunities that they need to probably work seriously on correcting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| I think this body owes a lot to the 59,000 children that are in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1640)|
| 0:27:29| and I think we owe a lot for not only the students but the teachers as well, about 3,700 teachers that we have in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1649)|
| 0:27:40| I get a little disappointed, I think, when I open up the new Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| and I see that on the front page there's some problem with the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| whether with an employee or they've now raised the salaries of somebody or they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| I don't feel like we always get all the information that we should get from the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| and I'm hoping that on county commission that one thing that I can do is work with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| to get that information that we need because I don't think they have been up front on all their expenditures to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| and I would look forward for that opportunity to work together with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| What other questions do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, gentlemen and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Next is Grant Stanifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1710)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you so much for your time today and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| My decision to seek this appointment is really just an extension and continuation of my years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1725)|
| 0:28:56| 10 years as a pastor in Farragut and then for the last 10 years with Compassion Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1736)|
| 0:29:04| I bring to this opportunity a knowledge of Knox County that is very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1744)|
| 0:29:14| Some of you are familiar with our Salt and Light guidebook in which we have put together a 440-page book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| that weighs about three and a half pounds, and we have researched every possible resource in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| I also have a son that's a police officer who's assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| I have a daughter and son-in-law who are small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| They own a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| They own the Plaid Apron in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| They have a wife who's been involved in disability ministry all over, really all over the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| but all over the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| And so I bring a pretty broad perspective to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| I also, because of my work with currently right now in the coalition, we have 231 churches in the coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| We literally have everything from Episcopalians to Pentecostals, I'm fond of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| and so to try to keep a coalition of that many different perspectives together for the sake of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| requires some degree of ability to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| I've also been married for 38 years, so I'm unsurpassed in my negotiation skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| and really bring to the table an ability to bring pretty diverse people together for the sake of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1833)|
| 0:30:44| Another interesting aspect of my work with Compassion Coalition is that there's been a lot of disagreement over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| about the ability to bring the faith community and government together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| And Compassion Coalition has been able to work very closely with the Knox County District Attorney General's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| in the Restorative Justice Program, also the Knox County Juvenile Court, Knox County CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| are just a few of the government offices that we've worked with, and once again have done that very successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| once again for what is better here in Knox County and for the good of Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| Have lived in Knoxville in March, it will be 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| Lived in the 5th District for the last 19 of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| All three of my kids graduated from Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| I love my community, and I love the county, and can bring not only a perspective from the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| but also from Knox County at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| So once again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| I appreciate those of you who took the time to meet with me, privately have a cup of coffee or lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| and the process has been a joy, and it's been an honor to be a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Any questions for Mr. Sandifer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Thanks, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I think we're going to take a break, about a 10-minute break to allow us for conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| For me, I'd like to conversate with a few of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| I would give them my feelings after this was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| And so is there any other discussion you guys would like to have as a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Mr. Chairman, you know, I think it's wonderful to have an opportunity to meet with each of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| And I'm just amazed because I honestly feel that probably any of those are more than qualified to sit on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1956)|
| 0:32:46| And I keep saying, where were you during the election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| But it's wonderful to me to see people come forward who are so qualified and who want to serve and who love this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| So for me, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Mr. Olney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| I just want to echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Sitting down with each of you all that I got a chance to, I think there's only one in the crowd that I didn't get to meet with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| but there's not a single one of these candidates that I wouldn't have the pleasure or wouldn't enjoy sitting next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2001)|
| 0:33:32| because I think you're all more than qualified to hold this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| And I think you would represent your district very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And it's shown from all the e-mails that we've received a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| I can't even count how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| There's so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| So you've got a lot of supporters out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| And I hope whoever doesn't get it will please consider a future running for this position or any other position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| But thank you all for the opportunity and time to sit down and get to know each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Again, I want to reiterate exactly what both these two gentlemen just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| All these people are more than qualified to sit on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and I do appreciate all of you stepping forward because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| in a time when I think some people are apathetic about government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| to have all these individuals who are overqualified to be sitting up here come forward is quite a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| And the e-mails that Jeff touched on, let me tell you what, we've got hundreds of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| There's a lot of people out there that support all of you that really care about the 5th District as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| which is really encouraging, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| There is no loser in this deal, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| And as Jeff said, if so be it, all five of you or however many, what the number is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2097)|
| 0:35:06| runs in 18 or 20 months, the 5th District would have a lot of choices to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| So thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Is that Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I can't pass also that it's saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| One of the candidates, well, several of the candidates that I talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| but one in particular gave me what answer I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| My question was, what was the most difficult question asked you and what was your response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2131)|
| 0:35:41| And the question that was asked was, what's your agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| And the response was to do the best I can to represent the people that would be in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2149)|
| 0:36:03| Coming to commission and not having an agenda, to me, sort of fits right with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and we represent the 40,000 to 45,000 people who are in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2169)|
| 0:36:19| A second person, and it's been mentioned, so the book, Salt and Light, has a wealth of information in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2179)|
| 0:36:32| and my copy of it's already been asked for by one of the Deputy Law Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| so it wasn't the Law Director, it's one of the Deputy Law Directors has asked for this copy of this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| What I'm rambling around trying to say is that all the people who put their names forward to this task are excellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2205)|
| 0:36:57| and the joke that was up here on the corner a moment ago when Jeff said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| and I'll be the person that has to sit beside them, and I said, yes, Jeffrey, they'll make you look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2223)|
| 0:37:16| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| This is a difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| We have received hundreds if not thousands of pieces of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| I would look for you to understand that I know the letter is coming from one person that knows that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| and it is a huge burden upon commission now to take all the information we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| and select the correct person to represent the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| So some of you will be disappointed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| The one that's appointed will be disappointed at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2268)|

| 0:37:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| It's a board discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| It's 440, so at 455 we'll reconvene for special session and take nominations and cast the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2278)|

| 0:38:52| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2335)|

| 0:38:57| you the ground rules and kind of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Any and all, we'll go around the room, take nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Again, the discussion has been, I believe everybody that put their name forth should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| be on the table, and we can't do a one nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So, we'll go around the room, and hopefully we'll put everybody on for at least one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| The bottom, we'll take the first round of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| The bottom vote getters will fall off, and we'll go in that manner until someone hits six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Nomination does not need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| And the nomination does not need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| So, once you make that nomination, it's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| So, any questions of the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150112?start=2372)|
