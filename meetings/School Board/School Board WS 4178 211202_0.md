| 0:00:31| Welcome to the Board of Education's December 1st Work Session Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Babs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=41)|
| 0:01:11| Do we have any elected officials here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=71)|
| 0:01:21| As was public notice, the Board met in Executive Session this afternoon at 4.30 with members from the Knox County Hall Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=81)|
| 0:01:31| And I would like to take a moment to have Mr. Dupour share some information regarding our Executive Session and the other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=91)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Pursuant to a couple different cases, Smith v. Anderson County Board of Education being the most prominent boards of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=103)|
| 0:01:53| other boards for that matter, are able to meet with their law departments to discuss pending litigation and matters that could turn into litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=113)|
| 0:02:03| This board holds those Executive Sessions every once in a while, usually every quarter, but can be held more frequently if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=123)|
| 0:02:14| It's not a time for the board to deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Board members do not discuss matters pending before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| It is a time for the board members and attorneys with the law department to discuss litigation, as I've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=144)|
| 0:02:34| Questions can be asked of our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| There's also another question that I believe has arisen with regard to the pending Sixth Circuit appeal from the Eastern District Federal Court injunction on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=159)|
| 0:02:55| And I believe that question revolves around strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| The way strategy works is that it comes from the law director as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| It comes straight from the county charter, which has been voted on by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| So that's where the strategy comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| However, our department carries out the will of the board, and that will is a public vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=194)|
| 0:03:24| This board had a public vote on masks, took those away over the summer, and so that is what this law department has been defending and acting upon in the court strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=204)|
| 0:03:39| And there has not been a vote on masks since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| Just a reminder that TSBA is hosting several one-hour superintendent search forums tomorrow, December 2nd, to seek stakeholder feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| The schedule includes a community forum at 6 p.m., but please keep in mind that anyone can attend any of the forums that work best with their schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=234)|
| 0:04:04| Each of the meetings will be held in the Andrew Johnson Building boardroom, and complimentary parking will be available at the Dwight Kessel Parking Garage if attendees bring their parking ticket to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=244)|
| 0:04:15| The full forum schedule is available on the Knox County Schools website and can be found at KnoxSchools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Please keep in mind, if you are unable to attend one of the forums tomorrow, we also have an online survey available, which can also be accessed through our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=262)|
| 0:04:33| Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| So we have a motion to approve by Ms. Warren, a second by Ms. Babb. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| All right, and I will turn this over to Superintendent Thomas for your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I hope you won't be too upset tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| This is a brief report, so brevity is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Just a few, just a couple things, actually. Last night we held a graduation ceremony recognizing the latest class of recruits from our security division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| There were ten graduates. These officers were sworn in after completing their nine-week training course, and I want to congratulate them again on this tremendous accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| I'm very pleased to see a strong new group of other officers joining the district, and I'm grateful for the work of Chief Jason Perriard to maintain the momentum of the training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=321)|
| 0:05:31| Jason has done a great job in transitioning from the leadership this year, and also I think we're going to see outstanding accomplishments from Jason and our security force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=331)|
| 0:05:43| I'd also like to express my appreciation to our school security officers who've made a commitment to protect our students, employees, and school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| And, Madam Chair, that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you, and I think Mr. Rutter is here to share some student data tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, members of the board. I appreciate you having me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| I was telling the guys over there that I tried to find a funny, like, data joke, and there's not any out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| And even the ones I found, nobody would understand but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| So, this is the third installment of our data moment, and so if you recall, we started this back in, like, the last week of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| And so when we met at that point, we were talking about kind of overall student achievement and proficiency across different student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=389)|
| 0:06:39| And so last month we talked a little bit about growth, overall student growth, school-level growth, particularly at the high schools, and growth among different student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=399)|
| 0:06:48| And so I had a request this time to kind of talk a little bit more about student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| So, this time we're going to look at student achievement through a little bit different lens, and that would be through the achievement at different subjects and grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| So, you've seen this slide before. This was part of the very first one we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| But I just wanted to remind people that TCAT performance is categorized on four levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| It's mastered, on track, approaching, and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| So, the blue and green segments in this particular chart represent mastered and on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| and so those two categories are the categories that would represent proficiency according to the state benchmarks that are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=445)|
| 0:07:37| So, one other thing we mentioned last time is, you know, when we look at things at the district level, there's a lot of data involved and a lot of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| So, we typically don't see large shifts from year to year in terms of student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| So, you can see from 2017 to 2019, the green and blue segments remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| I mean, there's just incremental change. There's usually 1% or less change across years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| But, you know, along came COVID-19, and it had really negative effects on student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| So, our overall achievement dropped by 3.8% that year, last year, compared to the previous testing cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=490)|
| 0:08:19| And, you know, if you compare that to the state, the state fared a little worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| So, they dropped about 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| So, you know, the overall message the last time we talked about achievement was that, you know, the pandemic had pretty serious effects on our student achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| and it kind of doesn't matter how you slice up the data, nobody was safe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| That was kind of the overall message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| So, I'm going to sound a little bit like a broken record tonight, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| So, just bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| So, the first subject I want to look at is English Language Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| We call it ELA for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| And so, you can see this looks very similar to the last chart that I had up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| So, you can see, again, you know, proficiency is not moving around a whole lot prior to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| It's holding steady at about 40% in those three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| And then, again, you can see the width of the blue and green segments shrink somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| And so, our ELA proficiency overall across all grade bands dipped 6.5% compared to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| And so, just to put that in perspective, it's pretty comparable to what happened across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| The state overall dropped 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| So, we dropped 0.5% more than the state overall, but it's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| So, this next chart divides that up even farther into different grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| So, each triplet of bars represents a grade level proficiency for each of the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| So, the bars on the far left, three bars on the far left, represent proficiency for third grade in 2018, 2019, and then in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| Same thing's true for fourth, fifth, all the way up through eighth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| So, these are the non-EOC grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| So, you can see, when you look across through there, if you compare the middle bars to the far right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| it's like this pattern is present, like the decrease in proficiency is present in almost every grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| except fourth grade being an exception, and it stayed the same there at 36%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| So, when we look across through there, the declines range from about 7% to 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| and the biggest declines are in our middle grades, 6 through 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| I don't know that it would be you, because I know you just looked at the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| but when you look at that fourth grade, there's such a big dip from how they did in 2018 to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| and then it held steady, and I just didn't know if anybody sort of had any idea why that might have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| I do not, off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| I didn't think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| You just take the numbers and analyze them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I've looked at so many numbers since then, it's all blended together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I can investigate that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Because, I mean, it's interesting, but it did not dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| I mean, I've seen it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Well, I'm supposed to answer that later, but I know it was the same 2018 to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| they spent an 8% or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Right, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| And what's interesting is no other grade did that, every other grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| It seems like there's something that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| I'll be honest, when I see things like that, I tend to think there's something in the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| like the instrument itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| So that might not be true, but I kind of suspect that in a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Especially when it's just one grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Okay, so Mr. Roeder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| So kind of, this is something we're very into, and so you might not know the answer to this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| but looking at the eighth grade test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| do you know, maybe, why they are noticeably lower than all the third, fourth, fifth, sixth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and seventh proficiency levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| I don't know why, but what you're going to see, especially when we look at math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| like it's even more pronounced in the mathematics subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| So I do think, I think one of my takeaways from looking at grade-level data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and we identified this when we did our needs assessments for the ESSER planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| like this is one of the things we are trying to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| is there tends to be a dip from fifth to sixth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| and the students aren't recovering, like when they're in the middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| So I think the teams that were on the ESSER planning did some investigation into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| and like I know there's a new math curriculum to address the math one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So like there's certain things in there to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| but I don't know what the root causes were that they identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Okay, so for the high school subjects, it's a, you know, same song, different dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| Like so English 1 declined about 6%, and English 2 declined 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| So overall, you know, my takeaway from the ELA section of this is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| you know, we had declines everywhere, but they were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| specifically in the middle schools, they were larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| and that probably bears looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| So we go on to math proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| So again, at the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Steve, just a quick question, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| So both those last two slides, those numbers are made up of mastered and on-track combined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Is that what makes up the proficient number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Yes, yeah, that's the combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Like when I say proficient, that is the combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Right, it's the combination of both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Yes, sir, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Yeah, so, yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Please interrupt me, because sometimes I assume things that I shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| So when we look at math, again, you know, we were pretty stable from 2017 to 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| when we put all the data together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| So we were hovering right around 36% across those three years for proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| And like I said, so our most severe proficiency decreases occurred in math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| and we weren't alone in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Like that happened across the state of Tennessee, and it happened across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| So as bad as COVID was for learning loss, it was the worst for mathematics, it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| So our proficiency declined 8.6% from 2019 to 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| And if you compare that to the state, the state declined 12% overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| So we actually, we fared better than a lot of students across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| but it's still quite a large drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| So, again, this is a similar slide we had for ELA for each of the grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| So, again, you can see decreases in each individual grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| and some of them are, you can see they're larger than they were for ELA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and they're particularly large in the middle grades again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| So I think the middle grades is one of the things that we're trying to address with ESSER funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| and that was one of my takeaways from looking at all this a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| So the high school subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| So high school subject, I'll go ahead and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| We have a harder time interpreting these, and I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| It's because we only tested, we tested between 75% and 80% of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| We normally test almost everyone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| So if we're comparing Algebra I from 2019 to 2021, we're missing about 20% of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| So they just didn't take the test last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| So I don't know what to make of that, because it depends on who didn't take the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| if you're trying to make comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| But you can see, like, our proficiencies were lower last year compared to prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| And I want to point out something else, too, with the integrated math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| It's even tougher because the pools of students changed so much from between 2018 and 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| because we had some schools piloting integrated math early on in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| And then, you know, at some point those schools decided to end the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| and they went back to the more traditional math sequencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| So that's why there's only one bar in integrated math three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| because we only have one school doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Can somebody explain integrated math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Because especially, like, when you look at the first year of it, I mean, it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| I mean, is it a really – I mean, is it a hard level of math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| I mean, like, I don't even know what integrated math means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I'm probably not the right person to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| But I can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Yeah, I can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| So from my understanding, it's just a reorganization of the sequencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| and the math curriculum, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So, in other words, like, when I took math, I took Algebra I, then Geometry, then Algebra II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| So what integrated math is, it takes concepts in Algebra I and Geometry at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| and then Algebra II and Geometry at the same time, and interweaves all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| So it's almost as if they expose it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Yeah, I think the idea – like, I'm really getting far off my –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| like, I think the idea is to provide a bigger picture in terms of the mathematical landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| Yeah, you can – yeah, you can – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| Okay, so let's hope Gary Petko is not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| He's our math supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| But here's what – here's how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| So integrated math integrates geometry and the algebra standards so that in Algebra I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| what we consider Algebra I in integrated math I, it is 60% Algebra I and 40% Geometry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| So if students are learning about how to find – and this is where I don't want Gary to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| If they're looking at how they find the area of a particular shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| they may have numbers that are not whole numbers, but they may have decimals or fractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| And so they're integrating what they know about decimals, fractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| and their algebra skills along with their geometry skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| So they're getting the exposure over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| And the reason people might want to go to integrated math sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| is that students then have exposure to their algebra skills all three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| and they have exposure to the geometry skills all three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| So there's not this break in the middle where it's Algebra I, take a break for geometry, Algebra II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| We do see some of the integration happening anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| but the integrated math is strategically structured so that it is actually integrated algebra and geometry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Are we still offering it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Just at L&N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Just at L&N STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Does that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Shannon, before you go, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| So has it always just been offered at L&N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| West piloted it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| And they moved away from it because their feeder schools were not offering it in the eighth grade year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| so it was creating a transitional problem because the middle schools go to different high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| And so the students weren't on a consistent path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| So if the proficiency, like, what do you – okay, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| One, the first one, what do you think is the difference in integral math I and then II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| 9% proficiency and then all the way up to 47% in the II?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| So why do you think there's such a discrepancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| So what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So it says integral math in I was 9% proficient and then II was 47% proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1202)|
| 0:20:14| Any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I don't have an idea about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| I mean, I have some ideas that I would not want to put out there publicly without going through some feedback protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| And so the second question would be, so 47% is higher than any other percentage on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| And, of course, we're talking about motivated students at L&N, so obviously that's going to play a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| But is Mr. Petko looking at whether we need to move toward this kind of concept for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| and get middle schools in line for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| We did some work with all of our high schools on whether or not we should move to integrative math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| and at this point our recommendation would be that we hold steady with where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| because math standards are changing in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| and so we don't want to make any broad changes now and then have to change again in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| So that's a conversation that we'll have with our department chairs and our math teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| as we get ready for the next round of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| because they'll also at that time release the next round of courses that are available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and we don't know if integrated or standard Algebra I will be the courses that they make available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Mr. Petko is on the committee with the state that is reviewing all of that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| and so he's keeping us informed of where they are in the decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| and we're planning to start conversations with our teachers in the spring to get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Ms. Owen, I think Ms. Owen, did you have a question for Ms. Beck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I do. I'm not sure for whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Do the scores that you're looking at for integrated math come from test questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| that are specific to those standards, or do they come from, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| so they don't come from Algebra and Geometry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| No, it's a different test altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| And so, like, somebody's questioned a minute ago about why the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| I will tell you this, like, because West is phasing it out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1318)|
| 0:22:08| So, like, I can tell you, I looked, because integrated math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| we tested 53 kids in integrated math I last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| So integrated math II was about three times that number, because we already had kids in it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| So they're finishing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| So, like, you're really comparing two really different groups of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| That's one possible explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| One of the other things is that with West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| the students who were in Algebra I and VIII grade stayed in traditional geometry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| and then traditional Algebra II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So it was the students who didn't have Algebra I and VIII grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| who were taking integrated I, II, and III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Well, and I was just to Ms. Horn's point, like, you look at the integrated math II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| and you're like, wow, they did so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| But if you look at integrated math I, it was worse than anybody's ever done in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| So it's – but I wonder if that's also going from a larger pool of kids in the integrated math I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| to not very many kids are sticking with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| So you have, like, that small group at L&N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| I don't know, but it's like the two – integrated math II makes you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| gosh, we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| But when you look at year one, you're like, nobody knows what in the world they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| And the other question, like, this is a question I have, just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| like that our department has is, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| I don't know how many integrated math exams are given across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| but there's a certain number you need for reliability and things like that for tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| and I'm not sure who's all taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| So I do know that some of our accountability counterparts at the State Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| when they launched integrated math, were concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Okay, so science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| This is an easy slide to interpret because there's no past years on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| This is all 2021 data because we had new science standards, and this is a new test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| So it doesn't make sense to compare it to what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| So if you add the green and blue bars, the on-track and master bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| our proficiency was about 45% for last year, and the proficiency across the state was 38%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| So we did a little bit better on our science exams than a lot of other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| And then the last subject here is social studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| And so social studies kind of bucks the trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| And so just so you know, we only give social studies exams in 6th, 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and 8th grade in U.S. history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| So the elementary students don't take social studies exams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Can I ask a question kind of going back to wherever it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| where we only had the one year of data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So, like we were just talking about, they're about to change math standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| So I guess that concerns me from a data standpoint of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| are we starting all over again and we don't compare to the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| So, yeah, kind of, kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| So how do we ever know if we're doing better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| I guess that's what's bothering me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| One would like to have multiple years of data in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| but that's a dream I have that hasn't happened since I've been in my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| So, yeah, you make a good point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| So the way these tests are constructed, like they have to do a pilot test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| to look for bad things in the test to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So that year doesn't count at all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| So then you kind of skip a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and then the following year is the operational test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| and that's when you start getting the data back for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| I mean, to follow up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| and maybe this is Dr. Reiswick or Shannon's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| but how do we know if we're ever changing the bar or moving the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| if when the standards change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| I mean, there still should be some way to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| if we can tell if we're getting our kids better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| We will still get results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Like, they just won't publish them or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Well, another part of that comment is you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| what we're basically saying is that proficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| being tested on one set of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| does not mean proficient against another set of standards, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Yeah, well, it's just a different test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Right, but for analysis and comparison's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| if proficient on this set of standards and this test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| doesn't necessarily mean proficient for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| That's true, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I would agree with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| So I have the same question that Virginia has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| So how do you have good analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| and be able to really move whole systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| when you're constantly changing what you're comparing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| I think the, I mean, these guys can chime in if they'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| but, yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| That's a hard question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I think, no, it's a really good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| and a lot of what we think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| and it's why we use multiple measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| So, you know, we have external assessments as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| such as, you know, our AIMSweb screeners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| that let us know if they're making progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| as far as those foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| We look at ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| We look at a lot of other data sources that help us to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and these tests are designed to give us feedback along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| on how our students are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| in order to make sure they're prepared both for ACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| but even more than that for being ready to go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| or be employed or enlist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| And so as we adjust the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| we're working a lot with our university partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and our employers to find out what are the skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| that students need to come to them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| as they leave the 12th grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| and then backwards plan from there to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| so what does that look like over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| So in the new math standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| we know we're going to see a lot more data and measurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| because even in your humanities majors now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| and in your humanities fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| there is a requirement for you to be able to understand data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| And so our math standards previously were very calculus heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| and so these are going to have a greater emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| in data and measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| So that's why they change with science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| You know, there are new discoveries that need to be worked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| or new understandings that need to be worked into the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| So that our students are ready to enter the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| with the most up-to-date science knowledge that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and be able to think like scientists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| So an example of that is in our previous science standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| they talked a lot about the scientific method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| and it was presented in a very linear way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| In the new science standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| it's much more of a recursive way of thinking about science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| You don't move through the scientific method one step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| It's teaching the kids now to go back through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| over and over again to iterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| and get better at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| So that's how those standards get influenced by what's developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| in both careers, university, military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| and we work to make sure that our students are ready for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And then we have to measure it against lots of different measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| That's why we don't react strongly to any single data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| Good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Does anybody else have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Mr. Watson, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Actually, I do have a follow-up comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I was just kind of processing what you were just saying, Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| To me, it kind of speaks to some of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| we've been having with the NGL work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| and kind of the portrait of a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| and thinking about students more holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| than simply data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| But it also seems at some point as we've become, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| more proficient at understanding some of these individual data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| that we need to move to a place where, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| we have a bit of a data dashboard that's really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| and considering multiple points at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| but then also understanding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| what are the levers that can be pulled to really influence that data, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| Because I'm sure you can throw lots of stuff up on the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| and say, oh, that's probably going to affect that or not affect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| but there's probably also some best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| So I think one of the things that we, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| need to continue to be educated on is not just these individual data points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| but how do they work together from a dashboarding standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and then where are those levers that can be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| so we can help influence that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| So, like I said, social studies is the one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| where it remained pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| compared to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And so it actually dipped, like, 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| And that trend was, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| it's consistent with what happened across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| The state dropped, like, 2%, I think, in social studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So, yeah, this one is one of the more boring slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Oh, so I had some TVAS stuff, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| So the far right column, you guys saw the TVAS stuff last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| So overall the district was a level 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| That indicates strong evidence that students succeeded their growth expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| We were 4 in literacy, 5 in numeracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and literacy and numeracy together we were 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| which is the same thing as composite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| So when you divide it up by grade bands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| and I kind of alluded to this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| when you look at the earliest grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| we had really strong growth in the early grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| It got a little bit weaker in the middle grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| and then the high school, you can see, they were all level 1s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| And remember, so what that means is that there's significant evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| that students missed their growth expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| So I don't have a slide for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| but when I dug into that a little bit deeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| what I found was that specifically the subjects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| the transitional grade subjects, like English 1, Algebra 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Integrated Math 1, those three, they were the culprits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Like that's what caused us to be level 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| So maybe, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| but maybe the transition from middle to high school was harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| during the pandemic for those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| But that's just my theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| So does anybody have a question about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| So our proficiency dropped, yet we show student growth at level 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| So remember student growth, when we're talking about TVOS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| we're taking the pool of students in Knox County schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| All 45,000 that are tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So is it because we were higher than the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| That's right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| So because the growth expectation is based off of how everybody else did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| So, you know, overall, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| to kind of sum up this from a data point of view, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| this one is kind of, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| I sound a little bit like a broken record, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Like the pandemic was just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| despite all the hard work of teachers and principals and district folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| it just, we weren't able to outwork the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| And so I think some of those achievement dips we see are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| that's real learning loss, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| we've got people out there trying to address those right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| and we're trying to address it with our ESSER plan that was just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| I think I would be, won't be able to sleep if I don't say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| I want everybody to really think about using these scores as a way to judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| our teachers' capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| It's a completely ridiculous way to judge our teachers' capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| And if we should really be able to see this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| There is no reason we should be using test scores like this to determine how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| our teachers are doing in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| So anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Rutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I actually really appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I know it's a lot of work, but it is helpful to have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2085)|
| 0:34:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Moving on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Is there any discussion on the consent agenda 6A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2098)|
| 0:35:07| So items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Any discussion on 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Contract number one around the instruction partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| I read through that, and I'm trying to get an understanding of what the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| and benefit of instruction partners is to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Actually, I'm very excited to talk about this because it goes straight to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| we were just looking at earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I thought you might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| So instruction partners is an external partner that has a really strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| literacy team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| And so they are we know that if we can get K-2 foundational skills solidified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| for our students, their chances of success moving forward in all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| subjects, but particularly in reading, is much stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| As we did our needs assessment with the ESSER plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| we have all the right furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| We have the right curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| We've got great teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| They understand the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And so instruction partners is coming in and helping us figure out how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| shift the needle for our students who are not quite getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| And so they're going to come in and do some walk-throughs with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| and we'd like to be able to share some data so that we can use that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| triangulate what's going on with our students and make some in-the-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| decisions about how we provide interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| how we're using our time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| how are we using our curriculum so that we can learn from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| And it gives us a good thought partner in order to understand what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| to do next in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| And is that thought level partnership primarily happening at the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| level, or is that a school-based level with instruction partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| We have two schools that wanted to do this work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| And so they are we're piloting it with them to see how it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| This right here is just for the data sharing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| We'll be coming back with a request to be able to actually do the scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| But we wanted to get started in being able to look at some data and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| understand some trends so that we can target our interventions and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah, I thought there was probably more to it than the data aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| which is why I was the prompting of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| We were so through CAF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| we were able to do a little work with them before ESSER was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And so this allows us to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| So as soon as all the contracts are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| we can then actually start funding work to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| to get the whole project moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Jackson, I have some questions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| For the two schools that have, that want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| are their staffs aware of the kind of data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| And I guess the question I really have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| looking at the student data being collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Rutter has already answered my questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| But in, in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| it says that the testing will be collecting data from the students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| will be used to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| What are the enabling knowledge, skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| and mindsets teachers need in order to teach effectively for all students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| What are the effective methods for developing the enabling knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| skills, and mindsets in teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| And what are the necessary leader actions needed to support this capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| So I'm wondering how, how that teacher data is collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| And if the teachers will be aware of that in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| So we're actually collecting it at the, at the student level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Not reporting for students with subgroups that would be, be identifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| We have masked the numbers so that instruction partners can't see who the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| students are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| but we're actually looking at tracking students over time to see if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| and we're in partnership with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| So this is not about us coming in and saying the teachers will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| We're having conversations with them about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| they didn't understand how a certain part of the assessment package worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| in the curriculum they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| So part of the feedback from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| because they were involved in focus groups that helped to identify this as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| And so the, the student data isn't going to them at that teacher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| It's going to them at the student level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| And then we're looking over time to see if the students we identify are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I understand the student growth part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| I'm confused about how it will answer these questions about teachers because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| there, there has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| the student data can't tell me the mindset of the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| The mindset of the teacher is coming through the focus groups and through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| feedback cycles that we're engaged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| So for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| when we were in a classroom one of the things that we were talking with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| teacher about is the way that the practice was set up and the curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| didn't fully make sense to the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| And so she was feeling a little frustrated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And so we were able to see that in helping understand the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| we were able to help her understand how to implement the practice in a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| So then what we would want to see is do the students then benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| Do we get the results if we do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Or do we need to go back to the teacher again and think through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| is this working for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Do we need to make adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| How do we, how do we adjust it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| So maybe mindset's not necessarily the right word there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| but we're really, I mean, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| the two schools we're working in the mindsets have been great as far as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| they want is for their students to learn and understand reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| And they've been very open to thinking about what do we need to do to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| them? And one of the things they're asking for is time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| which I can see that as a need that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| they need time to really dig in and understand how some of this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| curriculum is put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And have they been told on the front end that they are part of the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| So moving on, items, contracts, any discussion on three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2478)|
| 0:41:30| And item five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| Board policies, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| G or H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I or J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| K or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| M or N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| I believe at policy review we had planned to pull policy J193,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| which is the student suspension policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and discuss that at the next policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2543)|
| 0:42:34| This is 7N, am I on the wrong one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| It's policy, it's J193.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Yeah, J193 is the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| On my notes from policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| all I have is it says pull until next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So I think we were going to discuss that at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Do you remember the concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Oh, no, I think we just didn't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I think it was going to be put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| My recollection was just that Ms. Cook spoke about that one and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| that she was just changing the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| but maybe Ms. Cook remembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| You did want to pull it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| So we will remove J193 and revisit at the next policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2598)|
| 0:43:29| Any discussion on O or P?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| Q or R?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Ms. Ellen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| On 7R, which is J350, school and student health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| below D, I'm sorry, below 10, which is in line 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| if we could have a cross-reference to the communicable diseases policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| or a cross-reference just anywhere, I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2640)|
| 0:44:10| I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Somewhere I'd like to see a cross-reference to the communicable diseases policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| And it might fit below number 10, but at the end would be fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2660)|
| 0:44:40| So is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Items S or T?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| U or V?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| W or X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| Y or Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| I have a lot of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| I'm starting back with the alphabet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| I think this was the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| A, A or B, B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| C, C or D, E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| E, E or F, F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Ms. Ellen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I don't have a question about anything right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| but what I would like to do, if the board would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| I'm going to group these so that we don't have to go through them individually next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Several of them kind of fall into a category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| like changes that have to be done because of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| or we have some that are just minor language changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| So I'll just make a list of the categories they fall in and send them out to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| I'll send them to Ms. Coatney and let her send them to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| so that you can have time to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| I think that will make things a little more...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| We do have a lot this time, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| So moving on to grants, discussion on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Contracts, item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2791)|
| 0:46:41| Regular agenda items, item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| Item D, which is discussion and possible action on the legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| We did this in December last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I did attach last year's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I know we received an e-mail about that, but that was more of a reference point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| But I would like to hear the board's thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| I believe the General Assembly reconvenes early January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| and how we want to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| I just had a question because when we got the one e-mail asking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Ms. Coatney, and she was saying she thought TSBA was going to come out with some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| at the end of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Susan, do you know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| They will definitely update their legislative agenda based on what we voted on at the Delegate Assembly last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| So I looked at, I pulled out their legislative agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| and of course I think, I had this random sheet of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| so I think this is what they would have been had everything been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| But I just kind of went through and made notes on a few of them that I thought we may want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| And in looking at the original, our 2021 legislative priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| I think we would probably want to delete the hold harmless BEP funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| because I think that's already kind of been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| And then also the teacher performance evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| I would assume we would probably want to delete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Then the ones that I was on the TSBA 2022 legislative agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| which I'm sure they've probably already updated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| We could probably go ahead and request a copy for next week, which I think is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| But the ones that I was interested in that were different for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| the use of temporary assistance for needy families, that's the TANF funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| So the way I understand it, I was on a call, just so you guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| I was on a call back in February, and the TANF, let me, hold on, let me find my notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| so I make sure I'm telling you the correct thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So the way I understand this, TANF stands for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| And at the time, basically, sitting in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| was $732 million earmarked for Tennessee for the TANF funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| So what TSBA is recommending, and I believe we voted on it, did we, y'all remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2960)|
| 0:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| So basically, we voted on recommending that the General Assembly allow local boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| to use TANF funds for recurring costs related to funding positions that support social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| So essentially, positions that are in our general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| that would be specific to low-income families, at-risk families that would qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2988)|
| 0:49:57| So that was what they're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| There's all kinds of talk about how to use this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| and I think some of them were in the legislature last year, and so that's still a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| So this is what TSBA is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| So essentially, it would increase, it wouldn't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| it would probably go through the same funding mechanism as BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| but it would not be a part of BEP, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| It would be in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| So that was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| The other thing that TSBA was recommending and that we voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| is allowing school districts, schools, teachers, and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| the option to utilize benchmark assessments to measure growth proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Jennifer, did you want to say anything about the TANF thing before I move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| So the way I understood this, and anybody jump in if you understood it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| regarding benchmark scores, the conversation was around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| instead of using TNReady at the end of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| which we all know doesn't actually inform instruction for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| because we get it next year after they've moved on to the next grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| using benchmarks instead so that it could be used to inform teachers on what students actually need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| So they're wanting the General Assembly and the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| to move towards something that's actually usable to teachers, the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| And then the other thing that I thought we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| is we might want to look at options for third-grade retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| We talked about last week and approved a resolution around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| to allow school districts to make retention decisions for third-grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| based upon school district data, which demonstrates an understanding of ELA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| So basically, they're recommending that the General Assembly change that law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| so that it is more flexible for the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| and if students are progressing and if they are doing certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| So I think it's basically around flexibility for districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| And then there was one more, teaching incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| urging the General Assembly to provide incentives to individuals wishing to enter the teaching profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| and pay for the practice test for teacher candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| So those were specifically the ones that I thought we may want to consider adding to our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| I think that was a great representation of a lot of the points that was made at the Delegation Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| And I think I'm trying to remember back to the conversation that we had as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| related to this priority list last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I know one of the conversations we talked about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| does it make more sense for us to vote on a board on these issues individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| I think, Ms. Babb, you might have brought that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| about instead of voting this as a slate where it's yes or no, up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| having each board member allow them to vote on each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Because one of the reasons why I think that might be helpful is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I think there was a lot of good things that happened at TSBA related to that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| but I also don't want to presume that everybody on the board would feel great about each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| And if we vote as a whole slate, then your no says I don't like any of them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| I do think when it gets published and we send it from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| it needs to be sent as a board document that this is what our board as a whole is agreeing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| even though individual board members might have voted no to specific ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| So my suggestion would be that we take some of the feedback that you gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| and if there's other priorities that individuals of us are aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| is to create kind of a master list through Terry that we then bring to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| where we're able to vote on each of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| And I don't know that we're going to have a tremendous amount of debate through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| I don't think it's going to add hours to our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| but it at least allows individual board members the flexibility to be for or against individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| Ms. Bamberg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Yes, and I was not at the TSBA meeting, so you all might have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| but when we get down here to talking about the amend the BEP formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| we all know that they're talking about the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| So I guess I wanted us to probably look at the way this is worded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| and it might even be Mr. McPherson needs to get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| because I don't know what's going on right now about what they're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| and what they're proposing, and, you know, it's talking about very student-centered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| I went to that whole meeting that was here, and I didn't even understand what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| So I do think we need to, obviously the funding is a big piece of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| but I don't know if we need to look at the way we've been wording it since they are looking at changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| and I don't know if any of you all have any further information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| Ms. Ellen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Mr. Watson, when you're talking about voting on each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| would consensus in a work session be acceptable, do you think, or would it need to be a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I think that way is probably fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| We want individual board members to be able to speak to each issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| and not feel like they're voting up or down a whole slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| One, I also think that weakens the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| because I do think there will be some folks who do vote it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| because they feel really strongly about a particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| but that doesn't necessarily mean they're against the platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| What I'm thinking, Madam Chair, is maybe we should put this off until the next work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and we could have more work session time to go over each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| and then we would have our TSBA recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3341)|
| 0:55:50| I was going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3350)|
| 0:56:01| It was brought up quite a bit at TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| and I think I might be the only person from our board that went to the legislative special session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| or whatever that they had, and there were some legislators there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| and it came up quite a bit in that conversation, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| At least in that group, there was pretty broad consensus about what the concerns were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| about this ongoing conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| and it didn't seem like anybody was concerned about trying to make it student-centered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| It was all about what does that mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| and is this a way then to make it easier for a voucher system to come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| and there's some other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| So I do think there's an opportunity to reword some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| and really address the heart of the current issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| which is the current conversation that's being had at the legislative level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| to be able to speak to some of those specific points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| I don't know, Ms. Horn or Ms. Bounds, I don't know who was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| I read somewhere, Ms. Babb, and I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| It may have even been an email exchange I think that I had with Mr. McPherson about the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| I think maybe you made that point that we should have a priority, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| It was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| So Mr. McPherson is already thinking along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| so I think that would be wise to change it and to reflect the current conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| And then the other thing I was going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| so Mr. Watson, in thinking about, I definitely understand what you're saying about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| discussing and voting them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| So are you basically saying that we would go through, discuss them, and vote on them individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| then we would then have another collective vote to say this is our slate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| And Ms. Owen may have already asked this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| I'm just trying to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Yeah, I think if you did it by way of voting, which is my original suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| then, yeah, I think you vote on each individual item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Whichever items get five or more votes make the final document that gets voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And then we would vote on the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Yeah, so then when we do send it out, you know, there is more power in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| hey, this is what our board has said that allows people to speak into the individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| I just had a clarifying question because I think Ms. Owen said at our next work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| but this is December, that would be January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| typically we've met with our legislators in January and had this document to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| for whatever reasons, discuss it with the legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| and then they had that document when session opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| I don't have any objection to sending it to them later, you know, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| But depending on how our meetings fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| we might not have it for our meeting with them or when they began the legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| So it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| You were speaking to the January work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| I was speaking to the January work session because we wouldn't have another one before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| But that one would be January 3rd, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| That's our schedule changes, so we have the Monday, Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| So they would be finished by the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| And if we don't have a meeting with them, I can deliver those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| So it would be timely enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| So that change probably would help the timeline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| And Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| I'm just curious, when we create this document, do we work with our legislators to create this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| I mean, you know, last year this seems more like a messaging document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| not a document that's more of a strategic plan working with our legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| to come up with a strategic plan with tangible outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| So do we work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| I mean, we have heads of the rule committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| We have two members on education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| We have heads of the Senate in our Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| Do we work with them to create this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| It might be more productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| It probably would be more productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I just think it would be more relevant to what's going on in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| I think our priorities are more of these are the things that are important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| These are our priorities for the legislature so that our legislators can understand what is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| So the way we work with them is to adopt our priorities ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| and then share those with them so that they can understand what our priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I think if we go about it the other way around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| we run the risk of having our legislators tell us what our priorities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| and that's not very good for local control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3652)|
| 1:01:01| It just seems to me from last year we asked for money and no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| So it just seems productive to get things done, to work together, and just come to the table together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| Ms. Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I was just going to ask, are we having a scheduled time to meet with our state legislators in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| I don't know who organizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Is that Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| We do not have it yet, but we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Maybe a lunch or breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| We've done in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| In thinking about how to, of course we certainly need to meet with our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| but I think we also need to remember that so much gets done in committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| so we really need to make sure that we're engaging with the education committees now, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| because it doesn't really help to talk to our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| if everything's already decided when it gets to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| It's pretty much a done deal by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| So we really need to be working with the committee members on the education committees now instead of waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| I mean, I think that's where we always, I'm sure Ms. Owen would agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| I mean, that's where we always, you know, that's where the breakdown, I think, happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| because it's all done in those committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| If I can respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| That's one place where I've seen this document be very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| When a person has gone to a committee meeting to address the committee about a bill that they are carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3754)|
| 1:02:44| and has said that, well, Knox County School Board really wants this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| and here's why I think they really want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| And then a person on the committee has said that their legislative priority says the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| And that's something that having this document is very helpful to our legislators for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| because when someone is there telling them, here's what Knox County wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| but they have a document that we have sent to them that says the opposite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| then they know that that person is, you know, not necessarily giving them the best information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I would agree, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| I think that that's part of the importance of this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| is to be able, as an individual board member, to be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| I'm on the Knox County School Board and here's my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| and in addition to that, our board has adopted this as one of the things that we feel strongly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3816)|
| 1:03:45| So it just carries that weight of, and you're not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| and then you're speaking on something that we've already voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| It's something that, because you can't speak on it otherwise as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| It has to be something we've voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| And so it carries a lot of weight if we've voted on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| and we can use that when we're having these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| And if it's not something that we have in our legislative priorities, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| I think that it's kind of an easy thing to say, well, they haven't even brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| So I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| And I found it especially helpful with legislators who don't know us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| a legislator who may be new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| and having that first conversation with them when they have that piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| they know that we've not just gone rogue and telling them something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| Okay, so any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| So what I'm hearing is we want to move this to our January agenda to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| and we can all give our priorities or our wish list of priorities to Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3886)|
| 1:04:55| And maybe, Mr. McPherson, you could help us with the BEP priority there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| I'm sure you have some ideas and input there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| We would definitely appreciate your expertise with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Next is item C, and I'm going to turn that one over to Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Yes, I'm going to give an update on the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| First, I want to acknowledge NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Board members, we did receive a letter from NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| They had their own community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| so I want to acknowledge their efforts in putting that together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| to make sure that we have as many opportunities for community people to give their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| in the superintendent search, so make sure you look at that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| The letter will be given to our hiring firm, which is TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| There's a lot of acronyms right now, to be considered for the superintendent criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| so thank you for sending that over to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Next, the survey update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| We've had over 1,000 people complete the survey so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| so please continue to encourage community members to complete the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| And we've had a couple people also send direct letters to our superintendent email account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| so superintendentsearch at NAACPSchools.org, and then also the survey on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| So please continue to get your voices heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| because that is what we will use to collect our criteria for the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| The superintendent committee, search committee, is working on the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Our hiring firm did give us a brochure for us to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| and to give any feedback that's due on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| so committee members, please look at that and give feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| This brochure will also come before the board on the 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| so we will also look at it and be able to give feedback too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| but that is part of the adoption is the criteria and also the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| Ms. Satterfield, can you remind people when the survey ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| December 3rd at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| So the survey ends December 3rd at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Noon, not midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Survey, NAACPScountyschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| That's where you can find the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| The survey closes December 3rd at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Then also, our student rep did an amazing job with collecting student voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| and so I'm going to give him an opportunity to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| He worked closely with NAACPS Education Foundation to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and he's just going to talk a little bit about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| but we'll also use their criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| submit that information to our hiring firm as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| So go ahead, Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Yeah, so kind of, as you know, after that last general session meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| we talked about having student sessions specifically for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| provide their input on this use of printed search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| and we did carry that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| I worked with NAACPS Foundation with – I don't want to say her name wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| because I just forgot it for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| but I worked with NAACPS Foundation to set up these forums throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| and so kind of give you an idea of what these forums looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| We had three forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| We had one at Farragut this past Monday at 4.30, one at Fulton yesterday at 4.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and then also a virtual session that was open to the entire county yesterday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| And so in these forums, what we really did is our plan was to split students up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| essentially into kind of smaller groups of like about eight to ten people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| we really became like about five students in each group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| and let these students run through the three TSBA questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| and just kind of discuss it amongst themselves and have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| a note taker who is writing down all the notes about what the students talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| regarding these three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| And so kind of at the end of this, going through these three questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| we brought the whole group back together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| and had the whole group kind of share with each other what did they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| and what were their answers to these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| and we kind of wrote those down on a bigger sheet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| to make sure that all the students were like, okay, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| that's what we meant to say when we talked about that question and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| And so I think the number of students who came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| I won't give an exact number because I don't quite remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| but I will say that it wasn't very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Of course, 20, 30, somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| However, of course, there was very fast turnaround for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| We had about two weeks to work on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| and there was also a Thanksgiving break in the middle of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| and that definitely did not help communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| and effort to push this information out to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| However, I do think it was still a success for being something that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Knox County Schools has never really done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| bringing in this direct student input into something as large as a sprinted search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And so I think in that regard, I believe we should really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| to possibly doing more of these student forums to gain that input from students in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| And also I will say that I won't talk specifically about the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| because that's more for the next general session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| However, I will say that I believe the insight that was given at these forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| was very useful and was quite interesting to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| and it might be different from the input that is gained from the community meetings tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| And so I think it would be very valuable for this board and for TSDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| when we're looking for this new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Thank you, Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| And before I want to get to you, Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| but I want to reiterate just so we can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| No, go ahead, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Susan brought up a great point about conflict, potential conflicted dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| so could you bring that up and see what we want to do as a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| So the TSBA Law and Legal Institute will be on the afternoon of February 14th and the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4228)|
| 1:10:37| and I want to say it doesn't end until maybe 2 or 3 on the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| and that is the day that was originally set as the first day of candidate interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| So we may want to maybe shift by a day and do the 16th through the 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| rather than the 15th through the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| So I just wanted to make sure that the committee is aware of that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| So that will be something that I can bring up to Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| Is there any opposition to shifting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| Ms. Babb, did you have a scheduling conflict or is that at a later time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| Mine was the next week with the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I was on a plane when we originally scheduled the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Okay, so if there's a conflict with Tammy, I'll let the board know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| but we can operate under the assumption that we are changing those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| The 22nd, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Originally it was the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Any other questions about the superintendent search?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I'm going to do a recap of the community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| so I want to see if there's any questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Okay, community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| We have a – oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Yeah, just really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| I forgot to talk about this when I spoke about our student forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| To kind of reiterate what Ms. Atterfield talked about, the community forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| the survey, sorry, is a very important aspect of this new superintendent search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| and so just directly for the students, you can also fill out the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| and your input in these surveys is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We're working on, I'm working on, working with the KUF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| and also the people inside Knox County Schools to kind of push that survey out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| directly to students to ensure that they know where to find the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| and that they know that this survey is an important aspect of the search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| that you really should fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| So I hate that I wasn't at the meeting last time to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| but I did get to watch it live and appreciate all the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| There was one thing that I was intending to bring up that I brought up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| meeting prior to that, but wasn't, I don't think got rediscussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| I've been able to review the website that we put up and really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| all the information that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| There's a couple more things that I'm hoping that we can add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| One is whatever schedule that the committee has, the search committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| that that would be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| I know that we'd public notice the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| but if we can just put that schedule as it evolves, I think that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| And then the other thing that I think would be good to put there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| and I know we have it in our agenda list already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| but I think if we can add one point of information for all of our superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| search staff is also the minutes from those meetings when they're produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| and possibly video of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| I know we had discussed that, and I think Ms. Bounds even talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| that has been a possibility in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| So I think the more information that we put out there in terms of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| itself, I think the better the public will feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| Certainly there's going to be some folks who don't care at all about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| but I think the more information that we can put there, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| So, yes, I just want to reiterate one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Go to the Knox County Schools website to find the survey where you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| provide your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| The survey closes this Friday, December 3rd at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| Also tomorrow, December 2nd, there's a series of community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| with the final one being at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| We will be at the A.J. building in the boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| So please get your voices heard because we are rocking and rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211202?start=4456)|
