| 0:01:22| I hope all of you have picked up an agenda handout in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=82)|

| 0:01:35| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| and in the handout is the meeting schedule of those legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| For matters that are forward to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=105)|
| 0:01:52| the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=112)|

| 0:02:08| I would also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:17| for an online agenda and additional information on this and future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Today's meeting will be conducted in the order of the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=143)|

| 0:02:35| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=160)|

| 0:03:22| and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=208)|

| 0:03:46| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=226)|

| 0:12:47| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| This plan was done by our staff, primarily the transportation planning staff in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| with consultants to address transportation issues in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| Hardin Valley is one of the fastest growing sectors of the county, probably the fastest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| growing and that growth is expected to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| The mobility plan identified transportation system improvements that would address some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=787)|

| 0:14:27| Next item is the Chapman Highway Implementation Plan, an amendment to the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| General Plan, 2033, an update to the city sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=873)|

| 0:14:45| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I'll provide a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| This plan addressed that section of Chapman Highway within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| Transportation planning staff worked closely with the city of Knoxville Engineering Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| and with consultants to identify improvements to the Chapman Highway corridor that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| address the multimodal functions of that section of highway and will provide these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| to the Tennessee Department of Transportation as they allocate the monies budgeted for Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| Highway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Again, there was a great deal of public input and public outreach on this and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| played a key role in the development of this implementation strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| Staff does recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=937)|

| 0:16:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| The next item is the Plan Amendment and Rezoning Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| This is item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Applicant is Robbie Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Location, west side of East Governor John Severe Highway, northwest of French Road and southwest of Old French Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| Tract information is nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Present plan designation is LDR Low Density Residential A Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| Proposed plan designation zoning RC Rural Commercial, CR Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Existing land use is Agriculture, Forestry and Vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Proposed use is Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Staff recommendation is to deny RC Rural Commercial sector plan amendment and to deny the CR Rural Commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| Is there opposition to the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| The applicant, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| You have five minutes to speak and if there is more than one person who wants to speak, please split your time evenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:26| Please give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| My name is John Templeton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| I live at 1912 Serene Cove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you for this opportunity to speak and thank you for your service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| I live about a quarter of a mile from the property in question and I'm opposed to the proposed amendment and zoning change for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:54| The area along John Sevier Highway, which I call south of the river, you might think it's east, has a long and happy history as a rural residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:05| The area north of the river is industrially blighted, however necessary and economically productive those industries may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:15| I would refer you to the sad history of the previously quaint village of Asbury as a caution in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| Second, seldom is there a clear natural border between commercial industrial uses and traditional residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| However, in this case, the scenic French Broad River represents just such a recognized and functional barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| Three, if ever the slippery slope concept applied, the proposed amendment would be a fine example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| Four, it is not the duty of the Planning Commission to ensure the success of the applicant's commercial aspirations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| The heavily industrialized area north of the river is eminently more appropriate for these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Without a change in designation, the applicant will still own a tremendously valuable piece of bottomland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| Five, developmental encroachment on the river is already at a critical level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:28| Six, the area south of the river, east, is already overwhelmingly rural and residential, and that is its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:39| For these reasons and others, I ask you to deny this request. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Any other opposition would like to address at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Janice Pritchett, 1918 Serene Cove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| This is, I believe, the second time I've come before your body on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| As Mr. Templeton stated, this area is a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| It has a rural nature to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I applaud the Planning Commission staff who seem to consistently apply the policies related to the sector plan as well as the zoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:39| They've clearly delineated the reason this applicant should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Additionally, it's my understanding the applicant has run his business operation from his residential address on Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:58| Back in January of this year, he applied for a zoning change to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:09| This was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| So I asked, why would he then be approved to take a rural commercial into our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:22| Again, I respectfully request that you continue to deny a sector plan change or a zoning plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| Applicant, you're go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Robbie Toole, 2305 Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| The only comment I really have on this is the impact that all the opposition is going to be left with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1309)|
| 0:22:01| is that under this low-density residential, this property and the adjoining properties have the potential for several units of housing per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:18| If you look at these two properties, mine and the neighboring one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1338)|

| 0:23:58| Next item is item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| This is a plan amendment report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| And we've also got a rezoning, so there's going to be a total of three motions in this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Applicant is TM3 Properties, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Location, south side of South North Shore Drive, north side of Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:19| Process size of tract is 1.76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Present plan and zoning designation is O, office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| Proposed plan designation N.C. neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Proposed use is mix of retail and medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| Staff recommendation is deny N.C. neighborhood commercial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| On the rezoning report, TM3 Properties location is south side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:59| north side of Osprey Point Lane, 1.76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Present plan designation O, office, O1 office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| Proposed plan designation N.C. neighborhood commercial, C1 neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Mix of retail, medical and personal services proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Staff recommendation, deny N.C. neighborhood commercial one-year plan designation for the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| and to deny the rezoning to C1 neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| consistent with the denial recommendations for the associated plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Excuse me, Chair, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| My usual caution, I notice that the applicants have handed out photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| and information regarding a particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Please remember that when a property is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| all uses permitted in that zoning are permitted on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Neither this Commission nor the City Council can restrict uses under rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| That's my monthly advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Commissioner Emerson, do you have any comments on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| No, other than just to give a little bit more history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| The original application was for general commercial sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and one-year plan amendment and C6 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| The applicant came back in to request a revised application for neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| one-year plan amendment and sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| as well as the neighborhood commercial zone district for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| The reason staff feels that this should be denied is because a similar request came up in 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| for this area to go to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| At that time, staff couldn't justify a reason why this shift to commercial should occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| The office district provided a buffer for the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| and the neighboring commercial area and right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| The applicant present in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| I'm here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Any opposition to the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Would you like the opposition to go first or would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I'd like to go first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| My name is Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| The issue before this body today is an application on how to deal with a particular parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| that has been zoned office because of its location and the changes in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| that have taken place around this site at the North Shore-Pellissippi Parkway interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| Whether a neighborhood commercial zone with associated sector plan change zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| and a one-year plan amendment will be more suitable for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| especially in light of the small neighborhood that is on the other side of Osprey Point Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| which, as I understand it, represents the opposition to the request to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| This parcel of land is on the south side of North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| accessed from Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| On the east side of this property is the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| the ramp that goes up from North Shore onto Pellissippi Parkway that takes you to the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| And on the west side of this property is a storage monolith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| And I took a picture to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I took some pictures yesterday to show you what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| In case you don't get out there that often, that storage unit is Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| It's the first photograph I've provided you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| And if you turn the page to Exhibit 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| you'll see that the entranceway to that storage facility is on Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| The next exhibit, the third photograph, is actually a picture taken from North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| So in front of that storage facility you have an electrical substation for, I think it's LCUB, in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| And to the west of that property is a lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I think you remember the lake that flooded this year in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And so there is no development that's going to take place on the south side of North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| other than this one parcel that's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| And this one parcel is right across from North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:40| North Shore Town Center has a Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| It has all kinds of development, commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| and also apparently has a coming Taco Bell, which has its own ramp, I guess, from Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1789)|
| 0:30:00| In any event, I don't know whether you can see, or whether I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| Nope, my pointer doesn't work either, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| In any event, on the south side of this property is Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:22| And across Osprey Point Lane is a very small residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| It's called Stonebury Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And the question comes to this geographical backdrop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| why this body should change the existing plans, the sector plan, and the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| to accommodate a neighborhood commercial development rather than an office development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| That's what we're here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| First, there are no other lots available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| As I just explained, the geographical proximity is right next to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| and on the other side next to this storage building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| So there will be no domino effect if this request is granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| and the sector plan is changed with a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| In fact, late last year, you did the same type of commercial rezoning at the Westland Drive interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| where there was a small arc parcel there that I think Preston Shepard had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and it was rezoned to commercial right next to a storage facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| It hasn't been sold yet, but it's now been rezoned and is up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| That's not what's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Your applicant is going to build out this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| TM3 is the name of your applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| It's going to be the builder of this neighborhood retail establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| This site has been designed to avoid the kind of insults to the Stonebury Court neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| which is the neighborhood to its south, that high-rise office structures would impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| First, as you can see from Exhibit 4, the picture, it's a picture of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| Well, that's the top side of my client's TM3's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| and you can see that there are full-grown evergreens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and these are the pictures that we handed out here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| And those are not going to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| In fact, the buffer from Osprey Point Lane down to where this retail establishment is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| is going to be expanded to 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| and all of these native evergreens who are already mature will stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| and that is one of the things my client wants to do to keep a buffer between it and this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| Mr. Klein, please wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Well, I'd ask for more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Would you allow Mr. Klein two more minutes to finish up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. Klein, you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| So the buffer that's going to be here is going to be 50 feet, and it goes downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:10| So the dish at the bottom is where this commercial development is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| As you can see from the last page, we've taken great pains to make sure that the buffer stays where it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| and that there's no parking on either the south side or the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| That all is maintained in buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| and the footprint of this retail establishment will be less than a high-rise office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| So the lighting will be downward, so it's not going to be lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| The amenities associated with it, like the entranceway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| is going to be right across from this storage facility entranceway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| so you can't really invade the neighborhood up Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| And so the preliminary site plan, TM-3, has dedicated itself to amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| That's why the one that's in your notebook is a little bit different, this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| because this one has the trash receptacle, the trash area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| It's between the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| The additional landscaping, the screening measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| the building massing and design to mitigate adverse impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| no noise, no lighting, the voluntary increased setbacks from the required setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| and the building design elements all mitigate against a high-rise office structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| and these two one-story, no higher than 39-foot commercial establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| And so we'd ask that you change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| that you initiate at least the sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and allow this change for the neighborhood to have a neighborhood commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| that will not be two high-rise intrusive office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Opposition, you have seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| My name is Bill Hendon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I live at 9620 Leavens Way, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| I live in the Stoneberry subdivision, and I've been asked to present our side to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| I'm disappointed that the council didn't give me his exhibits to go over, so I'm not familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:45| I don't understand how he can say something here, and then when they get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| if it gets approved, he can change his mind and do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We're not guaranteed in any way that he'll do what he said today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| That's very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| The reasons for our opposition are set forth in e-mails to the commission by Tim Stewart, the president of HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:19| This has been denied twice on different occasions, and the staff has recommended denial twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:33| We live in a small subdivision, and you cannot turn left out of Osprey Point without a great deal of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:46| So the traffic pattern will be very difficult to maintain by people only being able to turn right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:56| and then it goes right up to the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| It's a quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We bought our homes there because of the remoteness from the other parts of the North Shore Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:14| and where there's plenty of land over there for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| and we don't think it's necessary to impose this on our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| The Osprey Point is a very narrow city lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| It has no curbs, and it has a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| So it's very difficult to have commercial traffic coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| I'll be glad to answer any questions that anyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you, Mr. Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Commissioner Hill, would you like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| I think this is a very reasonable request from the applicant and a reasonable use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| It has very limited or no impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| You could argue it has a positive impact on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| and in light of the fact that there's such a heavily buffered area that completely gives privacy to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:24| by definition of the neighborhood commercial, it will be limited in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| And so I see benefits to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I think the traffic impact, if any, it's not the result that this center would create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| The traffic impact is on North Shore due to the tremendous growth in that North Shore area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| So based on the applicant's reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| I would like to make a motion to amend the one-year plan, the sector plan, and approve the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Commissioner Clancy or Commissioner Roth, do you want to make comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Liz, for the benefit of the commission and for the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| can you go over what's allowed in both the office and the NC neighborhood commercial and C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:26| Can you go over the differences between those two zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| I'll just quickly talk about what is allowed in C-1 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Some of the uses permitted, the general description for a neighborhood commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| is areas in which the principal use of land is devoted to a neighborhood store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| It's a restricted commercial district limited to a narrow range of retail, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| and convenience goods only and to the first floor of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| The district is designed for areas where large commercial operations are undesirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| but where individual proprietary stores are useful and desirable for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| If you look at the range of uses, they range from food markets to drugstores to barbershops, beauty shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:13| cleaning, pressing stations, dry cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| Then there are some uses permitted on review, which include things like a dry goods store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| eating and drinking establishments, including brew pubs, churches, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| So that's the neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| If we look at the O-1, this is intended to provide areas for professional and business offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| and related activities that require separate buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| and building groups surrounded by landscape yards and open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| The intent herein is to provide centralized, compact locations for business offices, clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| medical and dental offices, as well as suburban locations near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| The range of uses that are allowed in here include any use permitted in the R-2 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| which is a residential district, except multi-dwelling structures or developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| professional offices, business offices, art galleries, public and private schools, recording studios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:23| halfway house, actually, with maximum capacity of five persons, personal gardens, community gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| and then there are a list of uses permitted on review that include things ranging from hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| to business colleges to churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you. That answered my second question well because I was going to ask whether it comes back to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| for approval when they have a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| So some things would be allowed by right and some things are allowed under use on review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Commissioner Hill, this requires three votes, three separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| The first one will be on the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| One year in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| I'll make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| He did already. He made one on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| He's made them all three at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| They need to be three separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I'll go ahead and do it in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| So amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| One year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Oh, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Sector plan, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| And the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Three separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Three separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| I'll make a motion to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| I'll make a motion to amend the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| I'll make a motion to amend the zoning to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Can we take one at a time, please, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| That's what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I will make a motion to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| We need a justification. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Due to the trends in...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Let me make my comment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| So, Mr. Green, you said we have to live with whatever zoning goes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| I mean, yes, we've got to be aware that the applicant may not develop what he's presented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| So you're telling me that if I approve this neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| I need to be prepared to see possibly a cleaner's or a grocery store or any type of small retail hair salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:39| I need to be prepared to see any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| But if I leave it office, then I can get another one of these or a halfway house or a ten-story office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:59| You can't get a ten-story office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Okay, a multi-story office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Those are the things I've got to worry about if I leave it in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And I didn't say to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Well, I mean, be aware that that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| So the justification would be the present zoning is more of a detriment to the area than the proposed zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| would be my thoughts on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Liz, could you clear up one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I might have not heard you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| But you said a convenience store could possibly be in C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Could that be a gas station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| Gas stations are permitted at C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Gasoline service stations, yes, are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| So a gas station could be in that area, and that would create a lot of traffic into that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| I'm just trying to make a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Thank you, Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| This is a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Does Neighborhood Commercial have any required buffers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| There are no, as I recall, there are no buffers required in C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| other than there are some in the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| There are some buffers in the current parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| If parking abuts residential zones, there is a buffer under the parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| but not from the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Can we make a buffer mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| I'll make a quick point of clarification, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| The rear yard does require, it can't be less than 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| and all of the service areas of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| shall be completely screened from the public view with plant materials or fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| That's in the Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| That's what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| In the rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Not in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| Commissioner Hale, you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Before we proceed, I also want to bring out that on the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| you need to make the justification for the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I don't think commercial is always a negative thing when it abuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| or on the outer edge of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I think there are some prime examples that would vote otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| and that is if you look to Sequoia Hills, that's a classic example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Probably was one of the forerunners to what we're seeing today in these walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:51| I would certainly embrace Neighborhood Commercial, and I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Because of that motion, I need to give a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| and I'm going to give trends in development population or traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| There's a motion by Commissioner Hill to approve NC Neighborhood Commercial sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2827)|

| 0:47:23| I don't think we need to call a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I think we've got three opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| I'll ask for a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2847)|

| 0:49:35| Size of tract is 1.14 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2975)|

| 0:49:46| Proposed plan designation, TDR, Traditional Neighborhood Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=2986)|

| 0:50:34| No, we recommend approval because it's in character with what's going on in the rest of the neighborhood already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| We feel like the residential use would be more compatible next to the residential that's existing, more so than the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| So we recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3046)|

| 0:57:00| The applicant is Michael B. Collingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| Location, one block south of Tassel Pike on the north side of Forestall Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| southwest of Roche Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Size of tract is .13 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Present plan and zoning designation is LDR, Low Density Residential, R2, General Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| Proposed plan designation, O, Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Proposed use, office for a video production company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| This requires three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Staff recommendation, adopt resolution number 10-D-19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| amending this parcel in the North City Sector Plan map to the O, Office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| Also, there is a rezoning report, same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| And the current, excuse me, staff recommendation is to approve the O, Office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| and also approval of O-1, Office Medical and Related Services Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Applicant, would you like to address the commission or are you fine with the recommendation of staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| There's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Oh, there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Please come up and state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| You have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:49| My name is Sherry Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I live at 332 Forestall Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| And I had seen the signs and just recently found out what the details, or some of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| I found out a lot more today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Initially, I had no opposition to it being rezoned to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| But I'm questioning the size of the site, 1.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| I looked into that property myself when it was put up for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| And unless they're counting a lot of paved land coming out of the driveway of a business or church on Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| I don't see how that could be possibly that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Excuse me, Ms. Raymond, I may have misquoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| It's .13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| .13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Okay, that makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Also, I was concerned about medical and office and related services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| because of the amount of additional traffic that it could put onto Forestall Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| It's a very narrow road, and it's a closed loop from Tazewell Pike at the dry cleaners in a loop and back up to Tazewell Pike by Smithwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3588)|
| 1:00:00| So we don't need a lot of extra traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| In fact, that might be a good area to put speed bumps on the road, but that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| I'm just concerned about the fact that the road is not only very narrow, it's not a straight line road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| and it narrows and then widens back out and narrows down again, and there's curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| If it's going to be low traffic like a video production facility, I wouldn't oppose that per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| but with that zoning designation, it leaves it open to the possibility of something that I would be against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Applicant, would you like to address, or are you fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:48| Please state your name and address for the record, and you will have five minutes to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Yes, name's Michael B. Collingwood, 1344 Weavertown Road, 1519 Deer Brows Way, Sevierville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3653)|
| 1:01:06| To address the opposition, the property is very small, so it will be limited to what could even possibly be put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| Also, right down the street, not but a block from there, there's a large church with a huge parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| plenty of traffic, way more traffic than would ever go into a small business in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| What the proposed use is, as of now, is a video production company, which would be very low impact for traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| That's it. I need a sign in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Commissioners, this will require three separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| What's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Could I just add one quick comment? I forgot to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| You have to come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Please come up to the podium, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3713)|
| 1:02:06| I want to make sure the applicant is aware of this too, because he might not be as familiar with the neighborhood as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| In some of the extreme rains that we've had, even in an average heavy rain, forest all drive floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| they've redone the drainage ditches on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| The amount of runoff from Tazewell Pike, the ditches that are there are still not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| Water completely covers the road, so it is impassable at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| I'm not sure which church he's talking about, but I don't know of one on forest all drive at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| If there's any traffic there, it's probably Smithwood, which is on the other side of Tazewell Pike, on Jacksboro, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| We don't get any traffic from that on forest all drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3770)|

| 1:02:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| You'll recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3779)|

| 1:03:03| I'd like to make a motion that we adopt Resolution 10-D-19-SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| amending this parcel in the North City Sector Plan map to the O office designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| because it would be a minor extension of the existing O designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| and forest all drive is developed with mixed residential uses, including multifamily and condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| In a small office, you should not create any detrimental impacts on the adjacent uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3812)|

| 1:04:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Next item is item number 23, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Applicant is Calton Development, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| Location is north side of East Emery Road, south of Bishop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| Approximate size of tract is six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| Present zoning is A, Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| Zoning requested, C, A, General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Existing land use, SFR, single family residential, and RR, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| Proposed use, commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Staff recommendation, approve PC plan commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Applicant requests C, A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| This requires one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Yes, would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Peter Salzman, 724 Exodus Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| The applicant is requesting it as a C, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| which will leave that up to them to build whatever they would like, and that's six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| The issue is that we, well, the neighborhood there lives right behind that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| There is nothing stopping them from building whatever they want next to a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| The other issue is there is, from St. Tenova Hospital all the way to Dry Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| which is about two miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| those are the only two traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| This property sits in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| The exit is on Emory, and it's in a blind spot actually when you go out of that exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:32| It's downhill and there's a bend, and it already backs traffic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| I am trying to understand why we're going to put businesses in a location where the traffic is backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:52| You can't get off of Bishop where, for us residentials, we have to go off to get to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4012)|
| 1:07:02| The other issue is that it's our privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| They're going to do whatever they want with a C, A, and we're totally against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| We deserve our privacies in our residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| The thing that we're looking at is for it to be a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:33| where they have to come before the board to build what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| Right now, like I said, with a C, A, they're going to build whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| We don't even know what's going to go up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| The third issue is they're going to find out that traffic, they're not going to be able to get out on Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| and there is a parcel right next to it that is a church property that we're worried they're going to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:07| and make an entrance-exit for these businesses that they're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| which will also back up Bishop, which I don't think anybody on the planning commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| has even looked at what the impact that's going to cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| What we're requesting is that it goes P, C, a planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you. Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| David Jernigan, Calton Development, 2017 Aylor Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| When we first came along and found out about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| one of the things that drew us here was Knox County Engineering is planning a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| and a realignment of Norman Jack Lane and Bishop Road, so they're going to be terminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| The plan right now is to terminate Bishop Road where it enters Emory Road now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| and then realign with Norman Jack Lane, and there's going to be a signal installed between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| Emory Road, Norman Jack, and Taggart just to the east of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:27| Are you trying to find it there on the computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| We're already working with Knox County Planning and the adjoining commercial property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:43| for connectivity back to that signal as additional access for traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| The traffic concerns that were brought up, traffic access to Emory Road is controlled by TDOT in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4189)|
| 1:10:00| That's one of the reasons we brought it up for general commercial because that's what the sector plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| The recently completed sector plan was general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| We're already working with the county on access to the new signal that they're installing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| It will give us safe and adequate access to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| and we'd like to abide by the sector plan and what was decided by the residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Ms. Albertson, would you like to comment on the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:41| Let Ms. Albertson speak first, and then you still have time left, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| I'd just like to note that staff is actually recommending approval of the planned commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| because that will provide staff an opportunity and the planning commission with an opportunity to review a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| for this location to address connectivity, access, and repairing issues during the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| You may go ahead and come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| He brought up the fact about the lights being switched at because of the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| and our rerun in Bishop that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| That hasn't been approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| The second thing is that still allows them to build whatever they want next to a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:35| and that's what we're fighting, that we do not want anything to go in there what they want to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| They could put medical buildings, anything in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| and then we're having issues in our properties that border that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| So, once again, I'm requesting it to go with PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Clancy, you had your light on first, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| No, I think he was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Well, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I think staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| I think plan commercial and Mr. Jernigan, I understand following the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| but without having connectivity worked out and with a lot of it being up in the air that close to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:30| you still get the same uses for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| You just have an additional review by staff and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| and I think this piece of property kind of merits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| We'll make a motion that we approve PC plan commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| Commissioner Buston, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Yes, thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I just wanted to make sure, I'm sorry, I did not get your name, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| We are voting on plan commercial, like what you asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| so I just wanted to make that clear that that's what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| and it will have to come back to us, the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I just wanted to make that clear because I heard you say that twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| and I just don't want you to think we're voting on something different than plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| The applicant had requested CA and staff's recommendation be approved of plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| And just as an added note, the plan commercial is a zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| that's permitted under the general commercial Latin use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| I said that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4417)|

| 1:14:09| east of the intersection with Tate Trotter Road, 5.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:19| Present zoning is A, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Zoning request is PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Proposed use is residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Density proposed five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| Staff's recommendation approve PR plan residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| Applicant requested PR to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| Ms. Albertson, do you have any comments you'd like to make regarding this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| I would just like to draw your attention to one of the attached exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| Exhibit A, 10G19RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| That's a 2018 aerial photo with the current zoning map shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| You can see the actual zone density for the neighboring planned residential zoned neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:19| most of which were zoned up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| And then you can see in red is the built density that we calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| So the range of densities that are actually built out in that area go from 1.66 dwelling units an acre to 2.76 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:39| So that is what staff is basing the three dwelling units per acre recommendation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Is there opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| There's opposition because this is removed off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| The opposition can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Opposition, would you like to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| You have five minutes to address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| You're showing our map on 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| It should be 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| Opposition on item 24, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Are you willing to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| The applicant took it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Go ahead, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| We just wanted to, I know we requested five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| We felt like that was, you know, the low density sector plan does allow up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| These adjoining subdivisions are older subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| Five is more the way, you know, it's more common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| With a smaller piece of property like this, it's difficult, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| to make the project work with a low density like that with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| the fixed cost and the cost of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| It's going to increase the cost per unit and the housing cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| And you don't have to look too far to find five or six or even more densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| If you look to the east or to the southeast a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| there are some higher densities nearby in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| So we would just like to request the five units per acre that we had requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| Thank you, Mr. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| Commissioner Clancy, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve PR plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Second by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I'm sorry, there's a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Mr. Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Yeah, I've got two lights here, so I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| That's because you're an important man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Go ahead, Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I think that because it's a small piece of property and because the zoning around it is between about two and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:20| that we shouldn't put five in the middle of two and three or put four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| I think it should stay consistent with what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Now, we have a motion on the floor, but that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| You're aware of the motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Browning, up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Could you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| So there are four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| Next item is item number 25, rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Applicant is Ball Homes, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| Location is west side of Marietta Church Road, north side of Hardin Valley Road and Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| Tract information, 117 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| This property is in the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Present plan designation is A, Agriculture, H.P. Hillside Protection, and A, Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| Proposed plan designation, LDR, Low Density Residential, H.P. Hillside Protection, and P.R. Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| Land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Proposed use is single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Density proposed is 3.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Again, there are two motions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Ms. Albertson, would you like to comment on this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| I wanted to note that there was a case that was in the general area of this across Marietta Church Road that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:10| Sorry, let me pull up the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| Back in 2016, where a slope analysis was done for that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| the staff recommended about two dwelling units an acre, and that's what was ultimately approved for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| This is a parcel just across from there, or sorry, up to two, is what was approved for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| A slope analysis was also ran for that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| so we're keeping in line using the recommendation from the slope analysis with what was done for a parcel in the same general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| The staff recommendation is to adopt Resolution 10E19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR Low Density Residential Per Attached Resolution Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| Also approve P.R. Planned Residential up to 1.88 acres, I'm sorry, dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:12| Applicant had requested 3.5 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I'm John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street, Collinsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Mr. Valiant, would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Opposition, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| If there's more than one person speaking, please divide your time evenly among you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:39| I'm Paul Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| I live at 2444 Covered Bridge Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| I think there's several people that want to speak today about this, so I'll be really quick with what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| As you go through Hardin Valley, Hickory Creek, Yarnell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| there's approximately 14 to 15 roughly subdivisions going up or under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| If you look at just the schools and all those subdivisions are zoned for Hardin Valley schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| you've got Hardin Valley Academy, current enrollment is 20, 2,086, capacity is 2,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| Hardin Valley Middle is 1,012 enrollment, capacity is 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| Hardin Valley Elementary School is enrollment 1,220 at a capacity of 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| So the residents of Covered Bridge, and many of them are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:46| but most of the residents, if not all the residents of Covered Bridge, which I'm talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| support the staff's recommendation of 1.88 and no more than 1.88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4972)|
| 1:23:01| If there had to be some consideration on it, we would advise no more than 2.08 as you just recently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| It butts up to that property, but no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| As you said in your report that the trend of the zoning in the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| you are keeping with the trend of the zoning in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5005)|

| 1:23:37| I've been a resident of Hardin Valley for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| I've seen the explosion of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| and we definitely need to see an improvement in the infrastructure before they do all this developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| Our roads already are overcrowded because we also have Pellissippi State that uses our roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| and with all these increase in the subdivisions and multi-homes, it greatly increases the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| and the roads do not have shoulders, so it makes it very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| We have common areas in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Other subdivisions are using our common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| which to me means there is a need for common areas in this new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| and with paths, walkways, trails, there's a barn on the property we would like to see retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| so that would also give an increase in non-residential house property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| It's just we'd like to see the utilities especially and those things developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| and they are in the process of being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| but the development is so much greater than what they already are at capacity for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| Thank you, Ms. Houston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| I'm Arsenal Smith, 2040 Creekside Manor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| My property, Creekside Manor, butts up against the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| I have a real issue with some of the proposals that I've read online from the standpoint that we only have one entrance in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:07| They propose to cut a road and tie into our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| We presently have already 132 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| We have multiple issues within the subdivision Creeksides from the hilly terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| We have a lot of runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| My property, for instance, backs up to the wooded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| It was a premium lot that we had to pay extra for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| It was flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| They came in and graded slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| My property is now coming apart from the back, even exposing my irrigation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| but yet they still want to say they're not going to do the vegetation and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| The real problem with the road is our kids, there's 48 kids that catch a bus right on the corner of Creekside and Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:51| There's no place to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| They're standing within three feet of that speedway now because it's being used a lot of times for tractor trailers and everybody to bypass I-40 backup traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5153)|
| 1:26:02| which a lot of people don't realize we get a lot of traffic from what road cutting over to the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| There's only one pull-off area in the whole from Food City West down to the Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| There's only one pull-off area, which is, again, this is a very narrow two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| The main thing we have still in our subdivision is, like I said, we have no lights, no sidewalks, no anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:29| It's kind of just a standard subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| The entrance is not lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| It's completely dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Again, like I said, we have 48 kids staying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| We have cars backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Well, they stay in their car because they're scared to let their kids stay beside the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| We're just asking for trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Finally, in our subdivision, we still have damaged roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Our roads are buckled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| We've had a leak in the road for almost two years now that's not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| We have issues that we continue to have with ball homes from flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| When it rains, a steady rain, we still have rivers between houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| I question their ability right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| They're drilling behind my house right now, and they've already destroyed vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Mr. Smear, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| I think the staff has spoken to the issues of utilities and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| They stated in their report that the additional people that would be coming to this area because of this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| would not add any additional children to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| The utilities are expanding out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| So the infrastructure is being improved as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| As a development company, we have met with Hardin Valley advocates to talk to them regarding this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5271)|
| 1:28:01| We've met with traffic engineering, and we have met with members of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| So I think we've done everything that we can do to assuage the people's fears, at least within county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:23| Now, we agree mostly with the staff's findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| What I disagree with is their density recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| They have said that the 1.88 is in the realm of the existing surrounding residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:45| The existing surrounding residential community had proposed densities of 2.8 and 3.0 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| What their recommendation is is in the realm of the low end of the build-out density of the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5333)|
| 1:29:05| We're asking for 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| If we get 3.5, what will actually be built out would be much less than that because of the slope problems and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:17| So we have to have a higher density to build it out at some number much lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:33| Part of Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| Liz had mentioned the slope analysis they performed on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| I guess I have a question for her about if we could pull that up on the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:54| When I look at this, the non-hillside portion, they're recommending a density at 2.0 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| And on the 0 to 15 percent slope, they're recommending three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| So I guess I wonder how you come up with two units to the acre on a non-hillside portion and three units to the acre on a 0 to 15 percent slope portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| I'll answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| We checked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| We saw that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| And one of our commissioners saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| It was based on the average of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| It was based on the average of the built capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| And that's the way we've done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| You choked me up with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| I think it was the response that I got from our staff that actually choked me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| And based on direction from the commissioner and discussion among staff, we will not be doing that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| We'll be using the same numbers, the maximum permitted under the land use designation for both the non-hillside and the 0 to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:14| So we actually have done a separate updated density calculation showing three both for the non-hillside and the 0 to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:26| And that results in just over two units an acre for the recommended density under the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| And we apologize for continuing in some cases to do things the way we always have, but we're adjusting a lot of processes and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:46| And another thing I want to point out is we met with Knox County, the planning staff and county engineering together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| and we showed them an early preliminary concept that we'd done on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| That concept shows Knox County several years ago come up with the idea of, in this 90-degree intersection, putting a roundabout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:11| They don't have it right now in their current plans, but we have spoke with Mr. Snowden at Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| and in our plans we have drawn in the roundabout and would like to enter into a public-private partnership with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| and go ahead and construct that roundabout as part of, be constructed as part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| So I think there's a, you know, that's a positive that's going to come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| We would like for a positive to come out of this is that that infrastructure improvement will be completed years before it would have been otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| I will give you a little extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| I'm going to have the lady up here that did not allow, I did not allow talk, but we'll give you one minute, please, to go ahead and make your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5574)|
| 1:33:03| Thank you. I'm Patricia Foster, and I live at 2203 Covered Bridge Boulevard, and I live right next to Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:11| Though Hardin Valley is a very desirable place to live and residential development is expected to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| the particular location at issue is one that rezoning should either be postponed or further restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| One problem is that proposed road improvements will not include the westernmost portion of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| There is a proposed roundabout we've heard about now for the three-way intersection of Hardin Valley, Hickory Creek, and East Galahar Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:36| but that will not really solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| The problem is that Hardin Valley Road is only two narrow lanes between the westernmost intersection and where it intersects with Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:47| Also, the traffic on Hickory Creek is already dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| The trucks coming from Vulcan to the new developments already underway are not monitored or controlled now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| and pose a dangerous driving zone for residents, many of whom are students at public schools in Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| I would ask that, at a minimum, the density be further restricted to no more than 1.5 dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| and that the development be predicated upon the completion of Hardin Valley Road improvements that have already been approved by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| Thank you, Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Does the applicant want to respond to any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| You still have a few more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Yeah, I mean, part of what we filed here is to put it in a plan zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| so we're going to have to come back before everybody with a concept plan for you all to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| And, you know, also part of that, there's going to have to be a traffic impact analysis done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| In order for us to proceed forward with the project, we'd have to make those improvements as determined by that impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Gerald, was the Hardin Valley mobility study, does it extend out this far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| I thought it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| So the road and the traffic have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| I'd like to make a motion that we adopt Resolution 10E19SB amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:18| because the transit and development population are traffic that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, seconded by Commissioner Roth to adopt Resolution 10E19SB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR, Low Density Residential, as shown on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| The chairs have a hard time looking to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| It's been that way forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| So it's just not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| David doesn't do me any favors either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| It's just not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| What I was wondering, on the slope analysis, if we're not going to follow our rules or our policies and so forth, why do we have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:16| The slope analysis is one of the guidelines that staff uses in identifying an appropriate density to recommend for a zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:28| And we do use that as a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| It was used in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| It's used in most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| Still choked up over this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| All zoning requests where the property is identified as within the hillside overlay, we use the slope analysis as a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| It's one of the guidelines to adjust the recommended density for that zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| We also look at the character of the surrounding area, the built development patterns, the zoning in the surrounding area, the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:06| and use all those to come to a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| I probably asked the question too soon because we don't know what the density is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:21| I should have held off until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| I hope we stay with our plan, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Thank you, Commissioner Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| There's a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:47| Let me just say first that we spent years and a lot of money on a hillside and slope protection plan that Knox County Commission did not adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5867)|
| 1:38:00| The city did, but the county did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I think that was a disservice to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| But that being said, we do use slope analysis in addressing some of these more difficult pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:16| The trick is to get a good development on a hard piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| Commissioner Graff, you've faced that challenge before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| The reason that a lot of these other parcels and these other developments have been approved at one density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:34| and developed at another density is because you can't do that in a lot of instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| It's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| I've always been inclined to increase density, and we get a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| Once we get a concept plan, if we approve a higher density and the concept plan comes in at 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| because that's all they could figure out how to get there, then we have the opportunity to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| that's a good development, or no, knock it back down to 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| Let's cluster on the less slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Put something into a conservancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| All Homes is usually pretty good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve planned residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| Commissioner Eason, you're last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010part1?start=5968)|
