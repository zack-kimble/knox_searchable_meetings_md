| 2:16:19| They're not in the Civil Service Merit Board rules because the charter says they have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| However, what I think is important, and I think it might be one of the reasons you've heard from a lot of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| is because 35 years ago Council decided to put those rules with the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| By doing that, you gave a tremendous amount of added protection to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| Police and fire employees cannot have the minimum requirements for their jobs changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8203)|
| 2:16:49| If I'm a senior firefighter and I want to promote to master firefighter, those requirements are housed in the Civil Service rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8209)|
| 2:16:55| They can't be changed without going before the board and without me as an employee having an opportunity to go speak to those rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8215)|
| 2:17:03| That gives employees an added layer of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| All of those class comp rules give that added layer of protection, and employees have come to count on those in the last 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| So it is alarming to suggest stripping those away and placing them with a different entity that has maybe not the same level of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8234)|
| 2:17:26| Okay, thank you. Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| So, to follow up on something that Ms. Hatfield just said about changes to maybe the base requirements for, for example, like police or firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8249)|
| 2:17:42| I would actually like to refer to, and maybe this is a follow up for later question, to Captain Thomas or Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8262)|
| 2:17:53| Or maybe I got that backwards, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| But in my work, we have accrediting agencies that determine factors like minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8275)|
| 2:18:07| Like, in other words, for insurance and certifications and accreditations, like, you have to have employees with a certain amount of experience or education or training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8287)|
| 2:18:21| I mean, isn't that the case? It's just not arbitrarily decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8301)|
| 2:18:29| There's accrediting agencies that oversee your employees' basis for being able to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8309)|
| 2:18:41| It's not based on what the supervisor feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| And especially when it comes to hiring, we have certain post-peace officer standards from Tennessee requirements that we have to meet in the hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8331)|
| 2:19:03| So, you know, we have to have a medical, we have to have a psychological.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| So, even just the minimum requirements for police officer, there are some outside entities that determine what's required to be a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8347)|
| 2:19:15| The promotional process that's in place, the way we have our promotion set up for, you know, you go up a step to police officer one, police officer two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8355)|
| 2:19:26| there's a minimum requirement of how many years you have to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| Three years and you can test for another position up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| And you actually have to test for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| So, it's not a matter of me going and getting a reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| I think we focus a lot on reclassifications and where there is a promotional process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| The reclassification, really, I don't see that applying in the police officer ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| In our civilian side, we've had some because the job just didn't fit with what the civilian was doing in the office environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8389)|
| 2:19:57| And those, I had one go through and got reclassified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| It needed to be reclassified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| That was probably about two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| So, am I answering your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| Yeah, it's not just determined by civil service merit board or an HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| It's determined by industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| I mean, there are people that can't have my job because they don't have the right degree in credentialing for my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| And my supervisor can't just change that because the institution loses their accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| Or they get dinged in an accreditation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| Just like in a hospital, you have to have certain people with certain credentials or you don't get your accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| So, we have things that hinge upon the qualities of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| So, I mean, we wouldn't be changing requirements for employees and their jobs and pulling the rug out from under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8447)|
| 2:20:57| Because we, in essence, would be pulling the rug out from under everything that we're built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| And being our city, our bond rating, our insurance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| I know we're determined upon some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| I mean, that doesn't ring true to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| So, that's all I was trying to make sense of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| I guess, Ms. Hatfield, the rules that are set by the civil service merit board for class comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| Those are the rules that you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| And so, the concern that employees, the concern is you guys set the rules now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| And so, the concern is there will be rules moving forward that set these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| And I think, again, I'd like to understand more about the accountability for the class comp system and how that's, how those rules are come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8498)|
| 2:21:51| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| To your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| About the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| As Chief Thomas noted, the only, so the only time we're bound to a specific requirement, minimum requirement in a job class is when there is a legal requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8517)|
| 2:22:10| So, for example, you cannot be an attorney if you do not have a law degree and you have not passed the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| You cannot be an engineer if you have not been certified by the State Board of Engineers and Examiners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8535)|
| 2:22:23| That is not, that does not exist in most of our job classes, including promotional ranks in police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8543)|
| 2:22:31| So, those promotional requirements in police and fire, while the entry level requirements are going to be bound by accreditation standards, post standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8551)|
| 2:22:41| Those promotional ranks are subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| There are not state requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| There are not, they can be changed at the will of a chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| Likewise, any job class in the city, that director can request to change those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8574)|
| 2:23:02| And I would, I would love it if what you said was accurate, that we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| Why would anyone do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8587)|
| 2:23:08| I say that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| Why would any leader or supervisor want to change the requirements in a way that diminish the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8590)|
| 2:23:18| But I can, I can tell you in my 15 years as the director, I cannot tell you how many times I have been asked to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8598)|
| 2:23:28| Because someone wanted to prevent a certain employee from being able to promote or apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| Because a director wanted to promote an individual that they preferred, but that did not necessarily meet the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8615)|
| 2:23:44| It happens, it happens more than you would like to believe it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| And we have always been the gatekeeper on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| We don't allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| But I could give you a long list of examples where those have been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8634)|
| 2:24:01| And we've had to say no, because those criteria don't match what the job should require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| So it's particularly concerning for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| We have an amazing police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| We have an amazing fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| We may not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| We may not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Right now, those two people would never make an arbitrary decision that would harm their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8657)|
| 2:24:25| But I can't promise that's always going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Requirements in police and fire have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8668)|
| 2:24:31| They have changed since I have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| And those are usually at the request of the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| However, when they're requested, I don't have the authority to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| The chief doesn't have the authority to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| That change can only be made by requesting it before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| The board has a public input period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| And then five people have to vote to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| I hope that answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Mr. Shields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| I just wanted to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| In the scenario that Dr. Hatfield was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| if a supervisor or director was engaging in conduct like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| regardless of whether Dr. Hatfield herself is that gatekeeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| the conduct would be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| And the charter already prohibits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| So she doesn't have to be the individual that hears that request and rejects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| Whoever hears that request should reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| And if they didn't, that's where the merit board's powers are at their most robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| That is the great benefit of the merit board, the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| not necessarily the staff who have taken over some of the personnel functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| that used to be performed elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| The real backstop is the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| And that's where its charter powers to hear complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| or to take up an investigation on its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| and to order that personnel practices that are inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| with merit principles cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| So it's not a requirement that the processing of that claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| be handled through the civil service staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| What matters most is that employees are sure that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| meaningful checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| And if the civil service executive director or secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| is the person to whom you wish to object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| if their decision is the one that you don't have confidence in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| you have to really overcome a significant amount of trepidation, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| to then take your appeal to the board that hired her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| But under the personnel department model that we used to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| and under the HR department ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| you wouldn't have that fear because if the HR director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| had aggrieved you in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| you're not appealing that decision to the HR director's boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| You're appealing that decision to an independent board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| And I just wanted to make sure that that was said as clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| And then my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| So I know in section two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| it was outlined that there will be a director of employee benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| and risk management and a director of human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| Vice mayor, that is already the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| We have a director of employee benefits and risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| There's just a mistake in the code where that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| and that director should have already been listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| with the other departments and directors and they were omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| But the department exists and the director exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| It's just in that one area where they were left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| through some past mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| Okay. So at this juncture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| informing a new HR, human resources department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| we would hire a director of human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| That's correct, vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| Okay. And when we talked about acquisition of talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| and retention, would this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| would this position be posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| Would there be some type of strategy to attract talent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8877)|
| 2:28:05| Or would we just have this as listed as an in-house position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8885)|
| 2:28:12| Vice mayor, I would like to post it publicly for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| I mean, I want to practice what I preach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| and get the most talented persons for these roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| and opening it up to the public would be a big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| And I'd be happy to accept candidates from internal people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| but also spread it out far and wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| and see what kind of response we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Okay. Excellent. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| Okay. Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| do we have any additional questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| before we go into public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| Okay. I just like, before we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| I'd like to just thank everyone, Mr. Shields, Ms. Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| mayor and your administration for all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| that you guys have put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| As council members that attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| the civil service merit board meeting yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| and what we've seen today, this is a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| This is a huge task and something that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| everyone's commitment to being at this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| So we can learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| Again, if we have additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| I think that we have open doors to be able to ask those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| and send by email or phone calls as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| So if there are no further comments or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| I'll turn it over to Mr. Johnson to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| with the public input portion of our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| We'll do our best to go in the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| in which we received the persons to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| We do have 12 speakers signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| So we will begin with Arturo Cano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8996)|
| 2:30:03| And I will keep the time five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9003)|
| 2:30:15| Mr. Cano, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9015)|
| 2:30:23| We will come back to Mr. Cano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Okay, well, can I go now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Yes, your time starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| My name is Arturo Cano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| And as much as I am highly opposed to the creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| of a new department, I am just one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| I do have more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| The only thing that really bothers me is the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| The administration's proposed ordinance was sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| to employees at a critical time when employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| were not aware of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| What I mean by that is the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| has sent out an email to all city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| that are on the list served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| What is very unjust about that is at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| the email was sent, well over 100 public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| employees were self-quarantined without access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| to the email sent by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| Council, I am not sure if you are aware of this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| but when the administration sends out an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| using the list served, not all employees have a city email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| Take for account public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| There are a total of 269 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| However, more than 200 of them don't have a city email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| and over 100 of them are at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| That amounts to 75% of public service employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| have no idea what human resource ordinance is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| Every single employee should have an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| for the matters of important communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| coming directly from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| I believe that when the administration selects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| the city employees using the list served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| they might actually think that every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| is receiving that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| That makes me wonder if all police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| and firefighters have a city email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| I also keep hearing about back in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| the personnel department was abolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| due to budgetary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| With the COVID-19 taking its toll on our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| the city budget now is even more tighter than it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| Also, I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| The first question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| why was it put into the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| that the employees representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| unanimously supported the reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| in which the city employees late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| had voted that we did not support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| Second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| how is spending a quarter million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| on two positions going to give employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| in police, fire, and public service more compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| Based on March 5th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| everyone wanted more compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| The third question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| civil service has seven employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| that have the title of human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| to their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Does the administration plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=9184)|

| 2:59:03| and I have a PO box, so it's 501 West Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| number 521, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10749)|
| 2:59:21| You're free to go, ma'am, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| I mean, I'm really new to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| so I just wanted to be on this call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| and to let the city council and the new mayor know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10770)|
| 2:59:36| that I am interested in the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| I'm interested in the old and the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| I think that it's, I'm really nervous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| so I just wanted to just touch on what Amelia Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10788)|
| 2:59:55| had said about allowing more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| for just regular old jail employees like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| to understand the changes that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10803)|
| 3:00:08| I know, personally, and the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| are experiencing a lot of hardship right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| and to be able to deal with this whole new situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| in a pandemic is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10820)|
| 3:00:26| you can't really focus on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| so I just wanted to let everybody know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| that I'm here and I'm listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| and I did sign up for the City Employees Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| which it was a group that I wasn't aware of that existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10841)|
| 3:00:45| so I'm definitely excited for the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10845)|
| 3:00:52| and learning different things in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| and I appreciate all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| that all the city council members have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| to make this meeting happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| I know you guys are probably wore out about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| but thank you, and I just wanted to let other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10866)|
| 3:01:11| know that we're all in this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10871)|
| 3:01:15| and we can learn together, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10877)|
| 3:01:23| Thank you, Ms. Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| Next, Mr. Lyon, it was said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| I could not attend Mr. Keith Lyon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| but he did ask that I read a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| so I will begin with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| We support a split of duties between the Human Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10898)|
| 3:01:42| and Civil Service Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| When the duties were combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| it was reasonable course of action during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| Over the last 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| the process of hiring itself has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| It was standard across the nation to take a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| to get a job in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Within the past decade itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| the recruitment pool has dropped 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| The exit numbers are increasing each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| 30 years ago, two to 3,000 applicants were standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| for an academy class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| Now it's two to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| Other agencies have reduced their hiring time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| to as little as 90 days in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| They have evolved to meet the job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| Our current hiring process has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| Applicants aren't just trying to get on at just one agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| They apply in as many as three to five at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| If they can be hired sooner than a year, we lose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| Other agencies have stepped up their recruiting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| to allow potential applicants to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| and take an entrance test on the spot at job fairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| putting them a step ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Other agencies allow active duty military service members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| to waive the physical test as long as they show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| a current test for the year of application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10984)|
| 3:03:08| The recruiting process needs to have more personal contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| with potential employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| The police department needs to have that kind of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10995)|
| 3:03:18| to applicants, which it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| The city needs a more modernized way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| of attracting potential employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| The city needs to allow civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| to protect employees' interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| as what they were formed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| In the area of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11014)|
| 3:03:35| most employees feel like the current set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| while civil service acts both to protect employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| and serve the personnel interests of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| It only protects the interests of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| In the most serious area of sexual harassment complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| an employee is called to civil service and told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| that cannot wait for advice from a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| even though such a drastic accusation has the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| to not only cost a person their job, but also their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11045)|
| 3:04:10| Due process should be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| in such accusations after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11053)|
| 3:04:16| The innocent is often accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11056)|
| 3:04:19| An institution that is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| to protect the employee's rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| and look after the city's personnel interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| cannot effectively look into accusations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| of that magnitude with objectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| Sexual harassment is a highly sensitive accusation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| which an organization is naturally going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| to protect itself first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| which can cause an innocent person harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| When this work started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| there were a couple of areas that were of concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| such as classification and compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| Once these areas are totally squared up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| with city employees, human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| and civil service departments would be a good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| And again, that was a statement by Keith Lyon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| current president of the FOP for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| The next we have is Deborah Jeffries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11109)|
| 3:05:13| Ms. Jeffries, you can now speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11113)|
| 3:05:17| If you would please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11123)|
| 3:05:24| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| Yes, Ms. Jeffries, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11126)|
| 3:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11127)|
| 3:05:28| My name is Deborah Jeffries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| I live at 109 Foster Road in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11131)|
| 3:05:37| I just want to thank the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11137)|
| 3:05:40| and the mayor and vice mayor for hearing me out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| I've learned a lot today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11144)|
| 3:05:45| about how things run under civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11145)|
| 3:05:50| but I'm all about having a human resource department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| I think it will free up civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| to focus more on the employees and issues that arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| I believe human resource will be able to focus the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| of the departments with recruiting new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11164)|
| 3:06:12| and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| I would rather have civil service fighting for my rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| and be focused on my problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| than have them thinking about other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| that they need to do for the day if I ever needed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11183)|
| 3:06:28| Human resources will take some of the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| off of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| Human resources will be able to handle small issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| for the employees under certain guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| and then more serious issues and offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11200)|
| 3:06:45| the civil service can take responsibility for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11205)|
| 3:06:49| But I believe the human resource department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| should have all new employees in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| That way it'll start out as a fresh department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| I'm hoping that both departments can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| just because they didn't get along back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| doesn't mean they won't today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| As a military vet, we have a saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| it's adapt and overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| I'm pretty sure we can all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| Thank you, Ms. Jeffries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11238)|

| 3:07:23| Thank you, Ms. Jeffries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| I've heard contact from Mr. Reyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| He cannot be with us, but he had prepared a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| in the case that he would not be able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| So I will read that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| My name is Phillip Reyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| 3400 Fountain Park Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| I am a city employee and also a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| of the City Employees Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| which represent general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| I want to read a statement from the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| The City Employees Association called a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| and voted without dissent that our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| was for the addition of two positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| rather than the creation of a new department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| First, an attorney in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| to assist the administration and departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| with discipline, interviewing selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| and employee management disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| where civil service is representing the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11300)|
| 3:08:24| Second, a human resource analyst in civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| to help with career building, job retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| talent acquisition and marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| This was presented at the mayor's work group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| on March 5, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| I want to read a few brief statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| on behalf of the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| We are currently in a state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| This is not the time to be making these legislative changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| During this crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| employees are not able to attend the council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| and have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| Employees are focused on their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| and keeping their families healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| This is placing unnecessary stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| on those who are already overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| There has been one work group under this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11345)|
| 3:09:10| and employee questions and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11350)|
| 3:09:13| were not satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| There needs to be much more conversation and clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| Although the salary for two positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| have already been budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11361)|
| 3:09:22| there will be additional funding needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| to establish a more permanent department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| Many departments citywide are experiencing funding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11368)|
| 3:09:33| and are being told to cut back spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| Why should this not be treated as the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| I would like to add that the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| of the city of Knoxville are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| who will be operating under these new rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| beyond this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| I believe the goals of Mayor Kincannon are genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| and in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11391)|
| 3:09:52| but I believe the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| should be tabled indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| until social distancing guidelines are moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11396)|
| 3:10:00| budgetary issues are resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| and we as a city need a period free of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| Thank you, Phillip Reyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| That was the statement he had given me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| in advance of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| Next, we have Robby Corum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11414)|
| 3:10:20| Mr. Corum, if you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| if you'll please give me your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| and you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| Robert Corum, 108 Oakwood Drive, Maynardville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11428)|
| 3:10:34| I began my career 16 years ago with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| I was privileged to work with Mayor Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| was the president of the City Employees Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| last year on this topic and on this work group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| I can say that there are a few differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| between the discussion we had then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| and this discussion that's going on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| mainly with compensation and classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| but it was determined then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| amongst the members of the work group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11460)|
| 3:11:01| and it continues to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| that there is definitely a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11465)|
| 3:11:06| for a human resources department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| based upon the different tasks that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| There is a clear conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| as civil service reaches out to represent the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| However, many department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| also reach out to civil service for guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| on the different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11484)|
| 3:11:26| and how they should proceed with disciplinary actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| So there is a conflict of interest there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| which should definitely have an HR division among it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| I am a little concerned about the compensation package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| and the classification package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| going to an HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| instead of a civil service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| I'm concerned and I realize that civil service merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11506)|
| 3:11:51| does protect all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| It's laid out in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| in section 1003 paragraph F, chapter 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| And it basically says that if anything comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| it is unmerited that civil service merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| would have the ability to cease and desist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| all those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| So I just ask council that as you read through the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| or read through the ordinance that's coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| I ask you to pay close attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| and make sure that the protections are held in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| or held to truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| so that we would be able to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| the careers that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| and the experience that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| I appreciate the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| and I appreciate the communication that's went forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| I honestly think everyone has the best interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| of the employees at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| It's just, we want to make sure that we get this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| so that we're not coming back in the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| and trying to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| So I wanna thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| I wanna thank you for your efforts and your energies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| I wanna thank you for taking time to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| to our phone calls and our emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| I also supervise several employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| within the public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| and their concerns have been addressed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11589)|
| 3:13:13| and I'll be relaying that to my crews in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| that the protections are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| We just want to make sure that they're upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| as is the intention of everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| So thank you very much for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| and have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| Thank you, Mr. Coram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| Our next speaker is Mr. Larry McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11612)|
| 3:13:39| I do not see him in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| Mr. McAfee, if you were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| would you please raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| If you phoned in, would you please hit star nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11625)|
| 3:13:51| I see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| Mr. McAfee, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| Yes, sir, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| Yes, sir, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| Would you please give me your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| And you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| My name is Larry McAfee, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| I live at 3333 Clevery Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| That's Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| I've been an employee with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| for almost eight years, come July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| I work in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| I'm the vice president of the Firefighter Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11659)|
| 3:14:24| I support having a department within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| that focuses on recruiting the best employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| in the country and retaining those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| A department that will concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| on competitive compensation and benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| training and development of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11676)|
| 3:14:39| and working to ensure that there's a great employee-employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11679)|
| 3:14:42| relationship, and also focus on labor law compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11682)|
| 3:14:48| These descriptions I just gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| are that of a human resource department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| These are not the role of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11693)|
| 3:14:57| Civil service is there to protect employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| I have an example of where civil service had a shortcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11700)|
| 3:15:08| When employees are promoted, another example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| was given from senior to master firefighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| there's a pay increase, where there's an instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| where certain firefighters get those promotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11716)|
| 3:15:21| and it was making more than a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| who'd been in that position longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| The solution the civil service department had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| was to simply increase the older employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| by a couple of hundred bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| Well, the Firefighter Association and the department head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11736)|
| 3:15:41| has come up with a plan to fix those inequities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| but they've been shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| I feel like the HR department would oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| that new solution that the fire department has given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| Also, Ms. Hatfield seems to have a lot of accolades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| and I feel like one solution would be for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| to simply apply for the HR director position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11762)|
| 3:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| Thank you, Mr. McCaffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| Our last speaker tonight is Mr. Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11774)|
| 3:16:23| Mr. Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| Yes, can you hear me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| I can't, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| Would you please give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| And you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| Mark Taylor, 2706 Alice Bell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| So I want to speak in favor of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11801)|
| 3:16:49| And I think probably, I know there's a lot of emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| in this, and there's a lot of fear in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| and type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11814)|
| 3:16:57| And I hear that from a bunch of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11817)|
| 3:17:01| But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| the primary function of any government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11824)|
| 3:17:08| any municipal government, state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| federal government, is to provide for the public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11830)|
| 3:17:15| of its citizens, its residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| the folks within its boundaries and borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| And we have struggled to maintain police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11840)|
| 3:17:27| and to maintain the minimum staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| or the, I'm sorry, the allotted staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11853)|
| 3:17:33| And that staffing is a reduced staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| from the mid-2000s already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11856)|
| 3:17:40| So that puts a lot of extra responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| and changing times back onto the average police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| that's answering calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| And the job has gotten exceptionally more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11868)|
| 3:17:52| over the years, less resources, less manpower to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11872)|
| 3:17:57| And we're asking a lot more of very young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11877)|
| 3:18:03| and then we're going to expect them to stay in this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| and capture that experience and provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11886)|
| 3:18:09| so that the citizens get a good service from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| So the environment has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| I pointed this out several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| and sadly, at the time, it wasn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| kind of viewed legitimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11903)|
| 3:18:28| The most important thing that a decision maker needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| is relevant, timely information and data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11912)|
| 3:18:38| so that they can make the decisions that they need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| so they can provide the services, the product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| to the citizens, to their consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| And it's not a personal thing or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| It's just that it isn't working currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| It's not working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| Our processes have been very slow to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| and in some cases haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| And that's not reflective of what we're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| to be able to compete going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| And I feel like a professional HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| that's just focused on HR and doesn't have to be conflicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11950)|
| 3:19:15| or having to wear two hats or perform this duty and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| and that's not fair to civil service or HR or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| whatever organization you come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| to fix the issue that creates a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| So my suggestion is to remove that conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11967)|
| 3:19:31| hire folks that focus specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| on getting us the information, the decision makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| you, this body, the mayor, the chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11978)|
| 3:19:43| the information they need to overcome this obstacle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| and let's reverse this trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| This is having really bad consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| for our employee population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| I respect all of the conversation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=11996)|
| 3:20:00| I'm very happy to hear the mayor be so willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| to address some of those issues that, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12004)|
| 3:20:08| and some of those, the ones that you went over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| and Councilman Roberto and Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12010)|
| 3:20:14| were some of the issues that our employees that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| had some of the biggest issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12017)|
| 3:20:18| And that gives me a lot of faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| in the process as it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12020)|
| 3:20:23| I think we've had good dialogue on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| Council, we do have someone who's raised their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| It's a telephone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| I don't recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12035)|
| 3:20:36| We have completed the list that we had for public speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12036)|
| 3:20:41| So I'm going to look to Council if they want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| from this person who's raised their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12044)|
| 3:20:53| Vice Mayor, then we're finished with, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12053)|
| 3:21:02| I would move to let them speak if they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12069)|
| 3:21:10| And then if for some reason it's a violation of the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12070)|
| 3:21:15| then sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| Mr. Johnson, if you will, go ahead and let this caller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| go ahead and speak, but we will not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| any additional callers because we do need folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| to sign up prior to the call to speak going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| Caller, if you'll please identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12093)|
| 3:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| Can you hear us, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| Phone number ending in 867.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12102)|
| 3:21:48| Okay, they don't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| They raised their hand while Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12110)|
| 3:21:54| Mr. Taylor originally spoke, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12114)|
| 3:21:58| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| That may have been by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| Council, that concludes our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| Again, I want to thank Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| for the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12127)|
| 3:22:07| I'm sorry, I just, I needed to bring one thing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12127)|
| 3:22:10| that I wanted to see if Mr. Shields could please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12130)|
| 3:22:16| In the public forum, Ms. Mailer mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| as did, I believe, Dr. Hatfield throughout the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12139)|
| 3:22:25| mentioning about there was a charter change in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| Based on what I heard yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| at the Civil Service Merit Board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| my understanding is that charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| has not been changed since 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| So I'm trying to get some clarification around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| because I've heard both and I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12163)|
| 3:22:46| I think it'd be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| Sure, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| The charter as a whole has not changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| from top to bottom in quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| but parts of it have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| And one of the parts that changed in 1980| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| dealt with the civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| and the personnel system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| So it wasn't a full scale change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12183)|
| 3:23:06| I think it was more of a piecemeal change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| Okay, I just heard something different yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| So I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12190)|
| 3:23:12| there was some clarification around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12194)|
| 3:23:21| Okay, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| Okay, seeing none, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12206)|
| 3:23:27| want to thank everyone for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| Thanks for all the telepresenters, to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| Yes, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| Vice mayor, I don't know if you had wanted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| to give like a two minute update on COVID-19 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12215)|
| 3:23:38| I'm happy to do it or happy not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| whatever the council wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| Yeah, if you don't mind, Mary, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12223)|
| 3:23:44| please thank you for that reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| I forgot that quickly because it was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| by Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12230)|
| 3:23:51| Okay, I know it's almost nine o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12231)|
| 3:23:53| I'm still at the office and haven't eaten dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12233)|
| 3:23:56| and I know you all are tired too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12236)|
| 3:23:57| So I'll keep this short and we can talk more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| I mean, we can talk as long as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| but as you guys know, I'm sure you're following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| Today, COVID-19, we had a total of 186 positive cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| That's up 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| We've had a pretty flat number of new cases in recent days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12255)|
| 3:24:18| like up maybe just one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| but today we had up 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12261)|
| 3:24:25| That may reflect that the health department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| been able to test more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| We're just going to continue to monitor the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12269)|
| 3:24:34| And there's 38 active cases, 144 recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| We have not had any new deaths, so four deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12280)|
| 3:24:44| So that's as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| I guess a couple of things I wanted to just mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| is that I am working with all kinds of groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12291)|
| 3:24:56| to hear their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12296)|
| 3:24:57| And we'd love to the extent possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12297)|
| 3:25:01| that you all have time to include you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| Yesterday, we had a meeting with small business members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| where local small business members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| where I was asking them what their experiences have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| and what their obstacles are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12314)|
| 3:25:15| And Patricia Robledo and Stephanie Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| are going to, we're going to follow up on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| and see what kind of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12321)|
| 3:25:24| for example, having challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12324)|
| 3:25:26| with getting the payroll protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| It's not as flexible as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| It's not this, and now today we hear the money's all out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| but some of the employees, employers have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12334)|
| 3:25:39| they got a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| but there's so many strings attached they can't use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12340)|
| 3:25:42| or that their employees would make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| earn more on unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12345)|
| 3:25:48| It's complicated, but anyhow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12348)|
| 3:25:50| I thought it was a good, you know, a good initial meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12350)|
| 3:25:55| And it had people from the restaurant business, retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12355)|

| 3:27:05| And that was interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| because they're considered an essential business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| and they've been open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12428)|
| 3:27:09| but of course people's incomes have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| the ability to show houses have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| So even businesses that are quote-unquote essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12434)|
| 3:27:20| have had a huge impact on their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| to conduct their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| And last, some people who couldn't participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| but the last person who participated was Adrian Webster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| who's a tax and accounting person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| for a lot of small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| And the reason I thought it was especially important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| to talk to small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| is because they're the ones that are least likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| to have a big reserve to like tide them over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12461)|
| 3:27:44| until we can reopen the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12464)|
| 3:27:46| And so that's the first of other meetings to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12466)|
| 3:27:52| The other, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| I'm going to be having a Zoom conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| with the Community Voices Coalition on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| because you're familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12480)|
| 3:28:03| That's a group that's very focused on equity concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| and they want to make sure that the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| and other people are making sure that testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| and healthcare access and business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| all the things that we're doing in response to COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| are reaching all sectors of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| including people who may not be able to do Zoom meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| and may not be able to access information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| in ways that are through the internet or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| So I'm looking forward to that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| You may have seen that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| I announced I've been working on a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| with my mayoral colleagues in Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| and also here locally with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12527)|
| 3:28:50| And we appointed a task force of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| there are four people from each metro area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| and it's a task force that's going to be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| with the governor and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| The governor basically now has two teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12542)|
| 3:29:03| One's like the medical side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| making sure that the hospitals have the capacity they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| in case there is a big surge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| That's called the unified command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| And then the other team is called economic recovery group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12555)|
| 3:29:19| And they just basically were put together this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12559)|
| 3:29:25| and they are focused on the economic aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| And so our task force has business people locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12568)|
| 3:29:34| the people that Mayor Jacobs and I appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12574)|
| 3:29:39| include Kathy Brown, who's a PhD and master,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| and you know, master's in public health professor at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12583)|
| 3:29:48| And also Dave Miller, who's the president of First Horizon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| formerly First Tennessee Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| Mike Odom, Knoxville chamber president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| And we wanted a small business representative on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12596)|
| 3:29:58| So Ryan Steffi, who's at Sonotaco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| he's going to be on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12601)|
| 3:30:04| And you may have gotten a press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| If not, I can share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| There's also a lot of outstanding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| from Memphis National and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| you know, infectious disease specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| hospital people, but also small and large business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12617)|
| 3:30:21| And so basically the idea is that they will come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12621)|
| 3:30:26| with some recommendations for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| what are the health criteria that we will look for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12630)|
| 3:30:32| My understanding is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| we want to have two weeks of flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| or declining numbers of new cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| before we, you know, remove restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| but I want to wait and hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| That's just what I've gotten from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| reading a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| And then you want to make sure to have widespread testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| And I know that they're ramping that up quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| in Knox County, but also across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12652)|
| 3:30:56| So they're going to help recommend, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12656)|
| 3:30:58| what the criteria are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| and then also do some guidelines sort of similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| to what, you know, Mayor Jacobs released a three-page set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| of recommendations that he shared with the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| The governor's asked mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| what are your ideas for how to reopen the economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12671)|
| 3:31:14| And so my first idea is make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12674)|
| 3:31:16| we don't do it prematurely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| but also understanding that we're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| a vaccine for COVID-19 for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12680)|
| 3:31:25| maybe a year or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| And so we can't, you know, the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| we have to learn how to operate in new safe ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12690)|
| 3:31:33| and have new norms where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| wearing face coverings is considered the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| especially if you're in a close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12699)|
| 3:31:42| and where, you know, retail and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12702)|
| 3:31:45| and other things, you know, just, you know, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12705)|
| 3:31:49| And so this entity is going to recommend, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12709)|
| 3:31:52| whether it's a fitness center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| or, you know, bush beans manufacturing or an office setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12714)|
| 3:31:59| or a small clothing store or a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| how can they operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| And when can we remove restrictions in a safe way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| where we don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12728)|
| 3:32:09| where we can get the economy going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12729)|
| 3:32:12| but also don't unleash, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| in a way that the COVID-19 is going to spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| beyond our medical community's ability to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| So that's what we've been focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| And also we're continuing to work closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12747)|

| 3:32:34| and all the social service groups that have been convened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| As you know, the guest house is opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| to serve our homeless neighbors who have been tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12760)|
| 3:32:44| and maybe even found to be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| It has a room for 18 currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| It did have a few people in there who were tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| and awaiting their test results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| Apparently their test came back negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12774)|
| 3:32:55| and they've left the guest houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| It doesn't have any occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12777)|
| 3:32:58| Nobody's staying there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12778)|
| 3:33:01| So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12781)|
| 3:33:02| I hope that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| continue to have positive results like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12788)|
| 3:33:09| Oh, also I'm, you know, preparing a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| I was going to do a state of the city address next Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| and I'm still going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12796)|
| 3:33:17| but it's not going to be a public event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12797)|
| 3:33:20| but, you know, that's going to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| the regular sort of budget components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12803)|
| 3:33:26| but also a proposal for how the city can spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| and, you know, spend money on social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| and protecting our vulnerable residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| and the COVID-19 response as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12816)|
| 3:33:40| So that's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| we're working on that and it should be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| a proposal that comes to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12824)|
| 3:33:46| and the rest of the city and community a week from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12826)|
| 3:33:51| So that's my short COVID-19 update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12831)|
| 3:33:58| I'm happy to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| We can also talk more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| Yeah, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12843)|
| 3:34:07| Thank you, Mayor Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12847)|
| 3:34:08| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12848)|
| 3:34:10| Just will we know more about the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12850)|
| 3:34:12| for the budget address at Tuesday night's council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| Basically the plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12858)|
| 3:34:20| we're not going to be able to do things in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12860)|
| 3:34:22| So, and in thinking about how it's been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| I've been to a bunch of them in the past for previous mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12866)|
| 3:34:29| and it's usually, you know, it's a great presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12869)|
| 3:34:34| but it's not super interactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| So we're trying to figure it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12876)|
| 3:34:39| and we want to make it be as informative as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12879)|
| 3:34:42| but also, you know, it's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12882)|
| 3:34:48| And obviously there'll be the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12888)|
| 3:34:53| and a little pop and circumstance involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| in a virtual manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12896)|
| 3:34:57| but then we'll have many, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| city council budget hearings and city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12899)|
| 3:35:04| to consider the budget and all that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12904)|
| 3:35:08| That'll be probably in a Zoom setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| but we're not going to do Zoom for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| you know, state of the city address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12912)|
| 3:35:13| That'll be some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| I'll let you know Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12920)|

| 3:35:26| comments or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| we're going to go ahead and adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| Again, thank you everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=12929)|
