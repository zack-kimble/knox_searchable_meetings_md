| 2:39:19| The person is not in office until they are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| And qualified under case law means sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| Let's just say again, then, the enabling statute, if the legislative part is not passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9570)|
| 2:39:36| but parts of ours and parts of their or their total executive package is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9576)|
| 2:39:42| and that doesn't clean up the charter, so to speak, do you have conflict then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| Or do you go back to state law on the ones that state law apply, maybe the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| or do you look at the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| You may have to ask me that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9597)|
| 2:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| The enabling statute, if I understand it correctly, takes care of matters, makes the charter, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9599)|
| 2:40:08| up to standard then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| You're talking about the consistency amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| I think the consistency amendment only really states existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| So I think even if the consistency amendment didn't pass, the spirit of the consistency amendment would still apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9617)|
| 2:40:24| But you wouldn't have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| Do you understand the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| The consistency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| The consistency, will you all be on my end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9633)|
| 2:40:41| That's why I don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| I understand the consistency sort of everything that's on the ballot, it will make the charter precedence, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9643)|
| 2:40:52| But if it were not to pass, would you still then the charter be effective on what the charter does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9652)|
| 2:41:01| and then the state constitution would be on what the state constitution does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9661)|
| 2:41:11| Still don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| Maybe I should withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| I'm having trouble answering your question in a vacuum because I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| and I can't anticipate what will pass and what will not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| There could be a number of levels of inconsistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| You could pass amendments that would create inconsistencies within the charter itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| That would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| You could pass amendments that could be inconsistent with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| but that may be acceptable if the enabling legislation allows the charter prerogative in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9701)|
| 2:41:50| And so it's going to depend on what passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| I think it's too difficult for me to answer that question in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| But back to my original question is two could pass and then there would be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| That could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| And what I was trying to say, Commissioner Ballard, in response to Commissioner Davis' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| which is, as I say, an extremely good point, is that we would work as hard as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9729)|
| 2:42:19| with commission over this process to fully vet the four controversial issues to make sure, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9739)|
| 2:42:27| there are no inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| That is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| We don't want any inconsistencies in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| That's the reason we want all nine of these on the ballot as separate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| We want it as clear as possible for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| We want the voters to be able to vote them up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| We're not going to go home mad if two or three of them fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| We feel like we've done our job by putting the issues forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| It came out of a legitimate public input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| It came out of a legitimate research process with a very legitimate question being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| We came to a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| We had a steering committee that we felt like was very representative of all parts of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| They came to a unanimous recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| We promised that steering committee that we would try to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| And that's what we're trying to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| So our obligation, we believe, our obligation is, first and foremost, to making government in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9795)|
| 2:43:27| the very best it can possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| We don't want inconsistencies any more than the commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| I think we all now understand the timing problems, but, again, if commission would work in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| we're going to work in good faith to make sure ultimately there are no inconsistencies on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| Well, I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| And I like what I've heard in that maybe you're a little bit more flexible than you have been because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9825)|
| 2:43:52| I'm really a nicer guy than I appear to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| Yeah, but it does point out a difference here in doing the best for your effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9835)|
| 2:44:01| and us doing the best for what we feel like our individual districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9841)|
| 2:44:06| Then they, if we do not work together and show a little bit of flexibility with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| then what will be to us, we've taken the vote away from the public again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| and we're going to let the court decide an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| And I would think that would be horrible, and I know that I want to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| And I would think that you all would do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| But that should drive in a little point that's been made, that has been made to this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| is by being that flexible, I think that could set that process into work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| That's exactly our commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| Yes, we've been shown by the law director today here that we can move this up to November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| There's plenty of time to get this on the ballot, either by petitions or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9885)|
| 2:44:52| I'm going to go along with Ms. Davis over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| If we're going to have these forms, I urge you not to vote for any of these things today on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| because we may vote for some that your constituents don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Now, if we don't want to have any forms, let's just vote them all up or down today if you don't want to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9909)|
| 2:45:10| But we've agreed to have the forms and listen to the people, so I don't think we should approve anything on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9910)|
| 2:45:16| reading today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| We're not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| I'm sorry, when we had the second reading before the 25th, if we don't have all these forms, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| There's all of us here and I didn't think this was a committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| I'm used to it being a full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| Jim Yurick is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| Commissioner Emeritus Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9939)|
| 2:45:45| I gave you a new title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| I don't need any new titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| I think I have enough titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| We're going to give you one anyway, Frank, Emeritus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| I've been called worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| Frank Lutho, 812 Naples Road, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9963)|
| 2:46:10| It may take me more than five minutes because there's nine ordinances and I want to talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9970)|
| 2:46:17| A little bit about my background is I was one of the five people who drafted the Knox County Charter that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| I also served as the Knox County representative to the last Unification Charter Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| So I've been on two charter commissions for that and I know how they work for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| I also served 22 years on this body plus another eight months of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| I served 18 years as chairman of the finance committee and 20 years as chairman of the pension board in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10005)|
| 2:46:53| I also will say that the reapportionment and Commissioner Briggs brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| and I want to discuss this issue because it's a very real one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| that I drafted the reapportionment plan for Knox County Commission after the 1980 census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| the 1990 census, and the 2000 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| Let me comment that I don't want to say things in terms of whether you should put these on the ballot or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| or even take a position, but I would like to kind of quickly review each of these charter commission ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10040)|
| 2:47:30| There's a couple I will not talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| but I'd like to at least briefly address each of those as to some concerns that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| and some that you have already expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| So one, and that is 101, and that is the number of signatures it takes to get on a charter thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10061)|
| 2:47:50| Right now, our charter states that it's 15 percent of the cubitorial race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10070)|
| 2:47:57| That's exactly what they're asking in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| And it's concluding that we have to file a state law and go 15 percent on the basis of registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10080)|
| 2:48:07| which increases that percentage tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| If we have to file a state law now, why would this one necessarily override what's already in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10091)|
| 2:48:18| says 15 percent here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| So it's the same thing, just as it acknowledges the Tennessee Code annotated, but by reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10100)|
| 2:48:27| that's noted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| That's just a matter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| I have no answer to that except that the voters have already spoken as to what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| So we agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| If we can get there, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| On the one about county employees, I think it's pretty clear as who's the county employees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10121)|
| 2:48:49| It's not entirely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| But I have some major questions as to the second part of that, whose compensation is required to be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10131)|
| 2:48:59| directly or indirectly by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| I've heard their explanation that they think that is a very narrow view of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| My question is I'm not sure whether that's 50 people or 50,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| Because I can construe, and the law department has not opined to that because they don't know the answer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| If they don't know, who does know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| Because if you take everybody that has any compensation from Knox County, then that is every hospital in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10162)|
| 2:49:29| We have contracts for every hospital in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| We have such agencies, the NPC, the Public Building Authority, Development Corporation, bus contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10172)|
| 2:49:39| We have many building contractors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| We spend $600 million a year in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| We spread a lot of money around a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| And if you want to read it in certain ways, we could be disenfranchising thousands of people from serving on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10190)|
| 2:49:58| or they would have to give up their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| That would be their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| So it's not just, as they say, just county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| The second part of that here, the voters can decide whether they think county employees should serve or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10205)|
| 2:50:12| But the second point of that, they may not know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| That's just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| I think it's very vague on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| That was Resolution 108, or Ordinance 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| Ordinance 103 that deals with the, and very briefly on this one, this deals that if you have a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10224)|
| 2:50:34| and they call it personal interest, and I have a problem with what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| that the form should be filled out by any employee that serves on the body that may have a discretionary conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10240)|
| 2:50:48| that they file this with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| Other things are filed with the Knox County clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| That's the one that keeps the minutes of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| So what mines do, we have different pieces of paper filed in different offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| My notion is we all have a place where we file significant pieces of papers and minutes and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10262)|
| 2:51:08| rather than have one office here and there where nobody knows where the proper office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10268)|
| 2:51:14| That's sort of a bookkeeping thing, but it may be an important bookkeeping item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10274)|
| 2:51:20| We also have one at 105, Ordinance 105, and that's the one that we talk about constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10280)|
| 2:51:28| I guess if this would go about and pass, they wouldn't be called constitutional offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| because the Constitution no longer reigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10294)|
| 2:51:39| Now, in what was passed at the last amendment change is that we define the duties, job, oath of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10299)|
| 2:51:49| and everything for those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| This one here, not only does it eliminate and makes them appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10313)|
| 2:51:58| it says the duties is job descriptions by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10318)|
| 2:52:06| Right now, those constitutional offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| most of their job duties are described by the laws of the state of Tennessee and the Constitution of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| They describe what those duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| Most of them have bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| We have no notion that they have put forth bond any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| We have no notion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| The jobs can change with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| And so what amounts to jobs at the state of Tennessee say must be done by these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10345)|
| 2:52:31| So it's more than just removing them from being elected and appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10351)|
| 2:52:35| The job descriptions can be changed almost at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10355)|
| 2:52:40| And so we don't know whether the clerk has to do the job of the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| We don't know whether the property assessor has to do the job of the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| It may be that we don't have a property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| We'll have somebody else to determine the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| That's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| And that's an important item to leave out, even if you go to an appointed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10374)|
| 2:52:59| There might be some logic for an appointed one, but the duties ought to be those that are required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10379)|
| 2:53:05| And that is an important exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| I take exception to it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| I think we ought to follow the wisdom of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| and the constitution of the state, at least not change the duties and requirements of these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10394)|
| 2:53:21| Commissioner Lutho has requested you get some extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| I thank him kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| I'm not so sure that Commissioner Lutho wanted to, but one of the others may want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| So there's not an appearance of conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| I'd like to make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| I'll make a request if we give him time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| He probably has to recuse himself on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| Ordinance 109, that deals with a commissioner recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| I feel very strongly, one, that conflicts of interest need to be revealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10436)|
| 2:54:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| If you have a conflict, you need to reveal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| There are times when you have a conflict that you need to recuse yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10445)|
| 2:54:10| But let me speak to an issue here that's different than nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| and a different than most other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| Knox County Commission operates on a constitutional vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| If the membership is 19, it is a regular resolution, it takes ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| If it's one that requires two-thirds votes, we're looking at 13 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| That is if you have 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| But if you reduce the size, those same things will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| There's only one way to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| That is a yes vote when you're present and vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10481)|
| 2:54:45| There are four ways to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10485)|
| 2:54:48| One, the vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| Two, if you're not at the meeting, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| Three, if you abstain from voting, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| And the fourth one is you recuse yourself, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| So what we're telling the person, if you have a conflict, you, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10501)|
| 2:55:06| have to cast a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| Your vote does count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| It counts as a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| Now, that may be where you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10511)|
| 2:55:16| But the bigger issue here, there are many things involving Knox County that are bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10516)|
| 2:55:21| than some commissioners' conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| You may be representing 40,000 constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| And because you have a conflict, you can't cast a vote for those constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10531)|
| 2:55:36| or for those in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| There are some issues that are bigger than a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| If they're revealed, everybody knows about it and says, I'm voting this way for my constituency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| for my conscience, and that is bigger than the conflict of interest that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10547)|
| 2:55:53| Because you are going to disenfranch the voters for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| Let's take the issue here that comes up about reapportionment, what I want to talk about next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10557)|
| 2:56:04| Can anybody here say that a commissioner that would vote for the district plans, for yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10564)|
| 2:56:12| for the school board's or whatever, claim that you don't have a personal interest in that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| I dare say that most commissioners, you would have a hard time defending a person that you did not have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| interest in where those district lines are drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| If you read this correctly, most everybody would have to recuse themselves from the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| which means you can never vote in a reapportionment plan because none of you could hardly deny that you had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10594)|
| 2:56:40| interest whether you're in the same district or different district or whether somebody else is in or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10600)|
| 2:56:47| It's a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| Everybody would have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| But if you had to force yourself to recuse yourself, you have a hard time getting there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10611)|
| 2:57:00| Let me address the last one, and Commissioner Briggs brought it up very early today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| and that is the reducing the size of the commission, at least those by districts, to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10625)|
| 2:57:13| Now, that parallels the number that's on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| And I see the wisdom when they say, well, we have the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| And they say, wouldn't it be nice if those two districts would line up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| There's some reasonableness in that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| I mentioned before that I drafted the reapportionment plans for this commission, three successive censuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10649)|
| 2:57:38| I don't plan to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| But it is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10660)|
| 2:57:46| There are constitutional requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10666)|
| 2:57:49| And I've always advised my colleagues when they say, I don't like the district, Commissioner Lutho, that you're reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10669)|
| 2:57:59| And I said, well, these guidelines have got to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10679)|
| 2:58:04| If you break them, in one year, both the General Assembly and the House and the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| they thought they were going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| Both times, courts overturned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| Ours in Knox County would never overturn because Iowa insisted that constitutional provisions must be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10696)|
| 2:58:23| and adhered to strictly, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| If you've got one person that's greater than that number, it's unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10706)|
| 2:58:32| The other one is clearly political considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| And politics invade politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| You don't take politics out of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10719)|
| 2:58:44| Now, if you must align these with the school board, you introduce further complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10724)|
| 2:58:51| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| There's some wisdom to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| There's some logic to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| I would think that the political difficulty of getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10735)|
| 2:59:02| One year, the school board, and I think it was the 1990 census, they gave one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| and they gave the list to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| And I happened to be in the law director's office, Richard Biller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| And he said, Commissioner Lutho, the school board just turned theirs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10752)|
| 2:59:16| They never asked anybody for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| Take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Since you drafted those for the county commission, could you give your thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| And I said, well, the school board can draft their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| But I took a look at it and I said, well, it's unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| I said, because they've got districts that are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| It's like putting a precinct in East Knox County and West Knox County and putting the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| You can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| And I said, well, I can tell the school board that what they're proposing is in error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10781)|
| 2:59:46| or I could attempt to try to follow their logic and go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10786)|
| 2:59:52| And I worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| And I did it very quickly because I knew how to move those things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| Unless you have experience, you just couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| Anymore, you could do heart surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| Dr. Briggs would do heart surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| We would take many years if we could possibly get there to do it because he has experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| He can do it, know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| So I knew how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| And I came to the conclusion at that time that there was no combination of precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10816)|
| 3:00:21| anywhere in Knox County that met the constitutional requirement, none, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| The only way to make that work was to move some precinct lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| and then that had to be done thinking how you would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| It's a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| Now, if you're trying to match those two up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| the other thing that you have under that is that this charter requires you to do this prior to the 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10840)|
| 3:00:50| You're doing that on the census of 2000, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10850)|
| 3:00:58| That's what we're operating now, the census 2000, which we would have to reapportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| Then it directs you that because federal law requires after you do the 2010 census before the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10863)|
| 3:01:11| which would be 2012, not for county commission as a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10871)|
| 3:01:17| That wouldn't be until 2014 or 2016 as provided in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10877)|
| 3:01:23| But the school board, because they have staggered terms, would be in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| So you would have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| It would be possible that several county commissioners who would be serving six years terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| under this provision would not be living in their district for four years because the districts would be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10895)|
| 3:01:43| Now, when you stagger the terms, that's possible for two years by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| School board members right now could be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| Commissioners can never be out because they were all elected at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| You're either in or you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| Can this be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| Yes, it is done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| State Senate might have that provision at time that you'd be in it when they reapportion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| and you might be out of your district for two years of that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| This would, by going six years, you could have some commissioners out of their district for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10929)|
| 3:02:16| Let me add something else that came up in the debate here about when the charter can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| I may be wrong, but I think that the citizens initiative for term limits was passed in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10949)|
| 3:02:37| But it was passed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| It was a citizen initiative to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| So, you know, I think it can be done then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10962)|
| 3:02:46| The Supreme Court upheld that provision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10966)|
| 3:02:56| I would think that as being a legislator for a long term, the ability to debate is always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10976)|
| 3:03:09| I respect this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| I respect these petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| I've known them for a long time and respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10992)|
| 3:03:16| There ought to be some ways of getting some things here, studying them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=10996)|
| 3:03:22| seeing if we can clarify some things so if we can stay out of court to determine what did we pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11002)|
| 3:03:31| The term limits is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| It was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| The voters presumably thought that they affected many offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| But the Supreme Court finally said that state law says you cannot do it for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| You cannot do it for anybody that's related to the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| That's why the clerks are out and the attorney general is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11026)|
| 3:03:51| For that, but still on the books we said everybody, but we didn't get everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| So state law does come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| I, like some of you, do not know when state law comes into play and when it does not come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11041)|
| 3:04:06| And those are important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| And I appreciate the law department, Mary Ann and Stackhouse, John Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11048)|
| 3:04:17| who have always done their level best to give opinions and all the predecessors for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| The word of the wise says, and I did that with fellow commissioners, when the law department opines, you ought to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11064)|
| 3:04:35| Sometimes I had maybe a different political agenda than maybe what they were opining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| And I said, I want you to research it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| I want you to research it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| I want you to study it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| Because you're not giving the answer that I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| An independent law director, if he's willing to tell me that I'm wrong and they're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11087)|
| 3:04:56| they're willing to tell anybody the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| And that's all I want is them to give that same advice to everybody and not be beholden to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11099)|
| 3:05:06| And so an independent law director to me is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11106)|
| 3:05:11| We're doing that for an inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| The same concept, that law director advises all departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11113)|
| 3:05:19| We ought to make them as independent as possible so they give the strict legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| Whether you like it or whether you don't like it, it ought to be the correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11124)|
| 3:05:30| And I thank you kindly for listening to me and granting me more than five minutes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11130)|
| 3:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| We have one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| I have a question for Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11146)|
| 3:05:47| Commissioner Lutho, I voted for you to take the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| I think when I talked to you it's because I told you we need good numbers, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| You've always been a figure in the budget and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| This is a little bit off the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| Would you tell me how that on this putting the register of needs and everybody in under the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11159)|
| 3:06:08| and everybody in under the mayor how we would save seven to eight million dollars that they're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| Well, I haven't looked at the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11174)|
| 3:06:15| I heard some of the numbers last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| I don't know how they arrived at that numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| If you took the total cost of what those operate, go into the salary suits and you can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11180)|
| 3:06:27| Now, I've done that before, looked at the salary suits and found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| There's two things when you look at the salary suits for these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| One is what the court or a judge allowed and what they actually spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11193)|
| 3:06:38| And when I did this for the unification effort, I wanted to bring forward what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| how many employees they have, what's the size of budget, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| And I found that for some of the offices they had about twice the amount of money that was allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| than they actually spent, where other ones they were almost right on the dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| It was like 98% of what they were spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| I didn't know the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| I presented both to my fellow persons on the charter commission in terms of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11222)|
| 3:07:09| because the important part of the government is just not found in the general budget in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11229)|
| 3:07:15| I don't my first thing is that you couldn't possibly save that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| I don't know how much you could save, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| That's I doubt it would be that great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| But there, of course, could be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| Those savings could be done any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| That's the person that operates the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| They ought to be held accountable for how they run the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| including the financial affairs or whether they are efficient or inefficient in running that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11259)|
| 3:07:47| I just don't think putting them under could save that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| I would say, too, that under unification things, a lot of times we think you could save a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11271)|
| 3:07:59| It was less than you would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11279)|
| 3:08:05| All I've said before is that you can have good government with a bad structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11285)|
| 3:08:14| and you can have bad government with a good structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| The thing here, it boils down to individuals who operated anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| This is a lot of things structural, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| These are a lot of structural changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| If they're improved structure, it may improve function, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11307)|
| 3:08:32| It may improve the function of your government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| And those are the things you look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11315)|
| 3:08:36| Does it improve the way we do things or does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11316)|
| 3:08:42| And I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| Well, you know, I couldn't see that kind of savings either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| You know, they keep talking about how many people we have in some of these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| But, you know, it's like our clerk's office here, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| We're into the passport business now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| We're into making titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| We're doing a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| And also, I believe I'm correct about this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11342)|
| 3:09:03| But I think our trustee's office does a lot more than most of these other offices around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| And, you know, so if we're doing more, we're going to have to have more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11347)|
| 3:09:13| I can't directly answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| My first thing is that that amount of money is much higher than I would have placed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11355)|
| 3:09:20| because it made borders to totally what we spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| And, obviously, we couldn't save all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| Commissioner Davis, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| No, I just had a comment me and William were talking about with regard to forums and setting these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11371)|
| 3:09:36| Next week is spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| So it's going to be difficult to really get a lot of community involvement or a lot of people to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11377)|
| 3:09:43| because we're going to have a lot of people on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| So I just do feel pressured a little bit to make a decision about some of these issues before our March 23rd meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11385)|
| 3:09:56| when I know that not everybody's going to be here in town that would want to probably participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11396)|
| 3:10:02| because they've got family obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| They'll be on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11404)|
| 3:10:05| So I just wanted to make sure that that group understands that we're going to try to schedule our forums so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11405)|
| 3:10:14| and try to give everyone the opportunity to come that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| So I hope that they understand that we probably won't do it during spring break prior to this commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11417)|
| 3:10:23| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| I've got a question for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| You know, Frank Leuthold is really a good numbers guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| I trust him any time he starts talking about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11433)|
| 3:10:37| Who does the numbers in your organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| I'm looking through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| I think you all have claimed that 600 people were involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11442)|
| 3:10:47| And I've counted, based on your signing in sheets, so far I've counted 292.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11447)|
| 3:10:57| And I have not gone through this list yet to take off the duplicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11457)|
| 3:11:04| You know, I know Mark Harmon is on here a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| But there's some names that I just immediately have recognized, you know, that they're on here a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11467)|
| 3:11:13| So those would need to be subtracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| But, I mean, how do you get that an organization that had 292 people, if my math is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11476)|
| 3:11:23| and, again, I'm not a numbers person, that showed up to meetings, and we haven't figured out which yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11483)|
| 3:11:30| I'd say there's probably several that their names have been counted multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11490)|
| 3:11:35| because they showed up at every one of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| How do you get that that's 600 plus people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11498)|
| 3:11:43| And then I also look at your financial disclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| And John Smith has made, has really boasted in the media that they've got first 300,000 in pledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11505)|
| 3:11:53| and 150,000 in cash on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| And then I look at this, and it's a little less than $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| And yet this organization is claiming that they can save Knox County a considerable amount of money when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11522)|
| 3:12:09| so far, the numbers don't seem to add up on your other data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11529)|
| 3:12:21| If they don't want to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| I'm waiting for the chairman to recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| Brad Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11549)|
| 3:12:30| No, when Commissioner Lambert is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11553)|
| 3:12:34| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| I'm asking, I'm saying that there's, I'm seeing a lot of conflict in these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| yet you're saying that this would save the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| And I don't see how any of these proposals are going to be a significant savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11563)|
| 3:12:48| And, again, the numbers that you've given us in other areas, either I'm missing some data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11568)|
| 3:12:54| or those numbers are not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| You're not going to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| I was having respect for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| Brad Hill, 6712 Cochise Drive, 37918 Halls Crossroads, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11585)|
| 3:13:14| Well, I have a series of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| Of course, Mr. Pinkston and Mr. Leuthold were absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11596)|
| 3:13:22| It's not $8.9 million in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| If you go to page four in your workbook, the last section, the charter amendments themselves, page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11605)|
| 3:13:34| you will see at the bottom the change will immediately bring $8.9 million in fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11614)|
| 3:13:40| from totally outside the standard annual budgeting process into discussions by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11620)|
| 3:13:45| and county commission on budget priorities for the community year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| I recall last night, Kathy Hamilton detailed that exact figure at our forum last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| as how much money will then be brought under the supervision of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11636)|
| 3:14:02| under the, again, checks and balances and not outside the budget process where I don't remember the verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11642)|
| 3:14:09| but there's a filing made with the court for the budget itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11649)|
| 3:14:16| And it is not under the purview of county commission nor the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| And what we're saying here in that number, where that number came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| I wish this was just a little bit taller, where that number came from, who derived that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11663)|
| 3:14:30| I believe you can find that number yourself, if I recall correctly, according to Kathy Hamilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11670)|
| 3:14:35| under the 2006, if you total up those various offices under the year 2006, it will total $8.9 million, not savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11675)|
| 3:14:45| That's how much their budgets collectively are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| So that's the first, and I will get to Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11688)|
| 3:14:53| Do you want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| You're saying they take that much in fees, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| It is my understanding, according to this text and according to what we've been educated over the last six weeks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| that roughly slightly under $9 million in 2006 was not technically under the supervision of the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11704)|
| 3:15:13| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| I believe, Commissioner Lutho, I stand to be corrected on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11715)|
| 3:15:18| You work for the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11718)|
| 3:15:21| I believe that all their overhead actually is paid out of a lot of these fees, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| Well, for all fee offices, they operate their budget through the fees that they collect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11726)|
| 3:15:34| whether it's the clerk, the trustee, or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11734)|
| 3:15:39| And all excess fees are then turned over to the general budget, the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11739)|
| 3:15:47| And, you know, I'm not going to argue what that number is because I don't know what all the other departments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11747)|
| 3:15:54| and how much their salaries are, how much their overhead is because PBA does charge all the offices space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11754)|
| 3:16:04| If you're in this building, they're charged rental space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11764)|
| 3:16:10| If you're in the old courthouse, you're charged rental space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| So that would be part of, I would assume, that nearly $9 million that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11773)|
| 3:16:19| But I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| That's the way I was understanding it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| Well, you know, that brings up, why do they march down here like Kathy Quest had an additional sum of 53,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11784)|
| 3:16:30| But as far as the fees go, that goes into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| except the only one that I know that does not go into the general fund was the 10% that we increased the trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11793)|
| 3:16:42| That was earmarked for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| There's an additional 10% attorney fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11804)|
| 3:16:49| There's the first 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| And then there was an additional 10% that this commission passed a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| And that additional 10% goes straight to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| But this fund is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| Now, that is paid by the delinquent taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11823)|
| 3:17:07| And that only comes into effect once the tax has become more than a year delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11827)|
| 3:17:15| So I get all other excess fees, though you are correct, they do go to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11835)|
| 3:17:24| Which when we do our annual budget, the finance director and the mayor in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11844)|
| 3:17:32| we do account for an estimated amount of excess fees to come in that we budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11852)|
| 3:17:44| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| To answer Mr. Lambert's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| the fact is the number I've been using is 400 to 500 because that was the range I was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11868)|
| 3:17:55| I've never used 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| But as far as those who have signed in, I consider everyone a taxpayer and a voter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11876)|
| 3:18:02| whether you're an elected official or running for an elected office or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11882)|
| 3:18:07| I haven't taken those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11887)|
| 3:18:08| If you'll let me answer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11888)|
| 3:18:11| The fact of the matter is there's just under 300 and you vet those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| I think Mr. Pinkston threw out a number of 150 to 200, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| I think it was Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| To me, well, last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| So the fact of the matter is if you take that and you take those who did not register that showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11903)|
| 3:18:30| and participated without registering, and believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11910)|
| 3:18:33| there's a lot of people that don't like to sign up for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| and don't want to have their name necessarily associated either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| And then you take the Internet process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| You will have, I believe, between 400 and 500 persons represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11923)|
| 3:18:49| The fact of the matter is that's the number I've been going with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11929)|
| 3:18:52| That's the number that I understand to be true and valid, and we can debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11932)|
| 3:18:56| The fact of the matter is also you're throwing out another big number of 420,000 people represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| which, of course, 30 or 40 percent are children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| So that's not exactly accurate either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11945)|
| 3:19:06| We want to pick this apart as far as which people who in each district we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11946)|
| 3:19:13| It's a rather futile argument in that the process took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| It was well publicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| It was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| We're going to have more meetings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| If you want to keep going backwards to that, the Knox County One Question process was very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11962)|
| 3:19:28| Whether you're on commission now or you were in the past or you weren't in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| you knew it was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| It went in five different meetings in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| Throughout the summer, the data was collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11977)|
| 3:19:40| The research was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| And I know the research isn't appreciated by some, but some people appreciate the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11981)|
| 3:19:45| The beautiful thing is this commission, when there's a full dais here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| this commission is a beautiful representation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| The fact of the matter is we're going to have opinion on one side and opinion on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| The hearts and minds of who's in the middle, obviously, are what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=11998)|
| 3:20:04| Getting to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12006)|
| 3:20:07| Well, I'm not eliminating folks who are running for office or folks who hold office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12007)|
| 3:20:11| or folks who are even on your steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| They're still Knox County citizens and their opinions need to be weighed with everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12013)|
| 3:20:21| But it's just, you know, I haven't even gone through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12021)|
| 3:20:25| people that participated strongly enough that they were willing to acknowledge, yes, I'm a participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12025)|
| 3:20:34| The 292 people, some of these names are on here two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12034)|
| 3:20:39| Now, I understand that even though, well, he's already left, but my colleague Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12039)|
| 3:20:44| that his name needs to be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| He's a Knox County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| But should it be counted multiple times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| And it just looks like these numbers are inflated to show an overwhelming grassroots movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12053)|
| 3:21:00| Same thing on the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Why were we first told by John Smith, and I understand he's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| that you had $300,000 in committed contributions, $150,000 in cash on hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12067)|
| 3:21:15| and now we find out it's under $60,000, is this a complete financial donor list that we've received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12075)|
| 3:21:23| Or was John Smith throwing out numbers that were not, in fact, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12083)|
| 3:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| I'll answer two questions real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| Commissioner DeFreeze, did you have a sign up last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| No, we just had the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Did everybody complete the surveys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| It was about 53 people completed the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| We completed it from District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| And you had about 100 folks there, I think, at least, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| There was more than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| Now, first of all, my point is not everybody signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12110)|
| 3:21:54| The count that we've been using has been based on the folks who were at the sign up tables counting heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12114)|
| 3:22:00| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| And, again, if you want to debate it, it really is counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12121)|
| 3:22:05| But that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12125)|
| 3:22:06| Now, let me answer your other question, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12126)|
| 3:22:09| I mean, you want to continue to debate and pick and name call, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| But it's counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| I haven't called anybody any names, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| Now, secondly, I was not there when John Schmid was interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12137)|
| 3:22:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12147)|
| 3:22:28| John Schmid, I think, was interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| I assume he was quoted correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| I think I know what he was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12154)|
| 3:22:38| That was, in January, in January, we tried to determine the projected costs of running a full petition drive on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12158)|
| 3:22:52| multiple petitions and all the costs leading up to August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12172)|
| 3:22:59| We anticipated it could cost as much as $300,000 to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12179)|
| 3:23:05| We were not prepared to go forward until we had determined, to our satisfaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| did we think it was possible to raise that much in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12192)|
| 3:23:16| There was a fundraising committee, just an ad hoc committee that was put together to go out and ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12196)|
| 3:23:23| Do we think we can raise that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| We asked a number of folks who are funders, the kind of folks that you would approach for your campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12205)|
| 3:23:32| or anybody else on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| And we believe there was the feasibility of raising up to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12214)|
| 3:23:39| Well, there's a difference in seeing the possibility of raising $300,000 and boasting that you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12219)|
| 3:23:46| And also, sir, I want to correct you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| Would you like me to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12228)|
| 3:23:49| Sir, I want to correct you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12229)|
| 3:23:50| It does not cost $300,000 to run a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12230)|
| 3:23:55| We ran a petition drive on considerably less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12235)|
| 3:23:59| If it is truly a grassroots movement, it does not cost nearly that much to run a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12239)|
| 3:24:05| We did it on a few hundred dollars, mostly out of our own pockets, and most of the money was spent on copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| Now, it may cost $300,000 on a petition drive and a marketing drive if it is a top-down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12251)|
| 3:24:18| rather than a grassroots, bottom-up movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12258)|
| 3:24:20| But if this movement is legit, it would not cost you anywhere near that much to run a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12260)|
| 3:24:28| Again, we are being totally transparent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12268)|
| 3:24:32| We are a combination of a volunteer effort and a contracted effort to do two petitions at 40,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12272)|
| 3:24:40| When we were doing our feasibility to determine whether or not we could go forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| we went out and did a feasibility study on whether or not we could raise the amount of money we felt was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12285)|
| 3:24:50| We felt the minimum necessary was $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| We felt the maximum that would be necessary would be $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| I think that is what former Commissioner Schmidt was saying when he was quoted in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12299)|
| 3:25:06| We set up the bank account, I think, about three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| We actively started soliciting dollars when we set up the bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| We had to have a legal structure before we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12314)|
| 3:25:17| We set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12317)|
| 3:25:18| We went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12318)|
| 3:25:19| And in that three-week period, we've raised a little bit over $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| I hope that is an accurate answer to clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| But that's the truthful answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| Lauren, I just want to tell you, that was the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| There were more people turned in surveys, but she just pulled the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| My only point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| No, I just wanted to explain that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12340)|
| 3:25:42| There were more people than the 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| I thought the meeting last night was outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| My only point is I know a number of people that I was with did not fill out surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12346)|
| 3:25:51| Now, are you going to count me as being there or not, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12351)|
| 3:25:56| And I think every public meeting is like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| And so, the fact that we have sign-up sheets, the fact that we preserve sign-up sheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12359)|
| 3:26:06| the fact that we have presented those sign-up sheets to you, the fact that we have disclosed finances today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12366)|
| 3:26:12| even though we are not legally required to do so, this is an open, transparent organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12372)|
| 3:26:18| If members of this body want to operate in that way with us, we will operate with you in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12378)|
| 3:26:26| If some members of this body want to use behind-the-scenes ways to discredit individuals in this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12386)|
| 3:26:36| Sir, any behind-the-scenes activity that's taken place, sir, has been from your organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| threatening that, oh, if you don't put this stuff on the ballot exactly as we have written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| then we're going to make you look really bad in the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12407)|
| 3:26:50| That's what's gone on behind-the-scenes, sir, nothing from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| That's not been behind-the-scenes, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| That has been out here in a public meeting where we said this is what we intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12417)|
| 3:27:02| That's not behind-the-scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12422)|
| 3:27:05| I think you also, I think there are people on this commission who will realize that this report was publicly released on September 9, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12425)|
| 3:27:15| There was no lobbying of this commission, no arm-twisting of this commission to do anything about those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12435)|
| 3:27:23| Our hope was that you would take them on yourselves because many of you had actually been to the public meetings yourselves in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12443)|
| 3:27:32| Many of you had been aware of the Baker Center report in August, and all of you were aware when we finally published our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12452)|
| 3:27:40| recommendations in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| We have not tried to lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| We have not tried to arm-twist, and we've not tried to force you into anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12465)|
| 3:27:49| We have said, however, here's what we plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12469)|
| 3:27:53| And if you want to do something different, we would hope that you would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12473)|
| 3:27:58| With that, we have one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12478)|
| 3:27:59| Joe Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12479)|
| 3:28:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| Last time you only called me Joseph, so we've got improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12489)|
| 3:28:10| My name is Joe Minichiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12490)|
| 3:28:11| I live at 311 Lindy Drive in Knoxville in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| And the first thing I'd like to say is I'd like to congratulate the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12496)|
| 3:28:21| I'm not from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12501)|
| 3:28:22| I moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12502)|
| 3:28:23| I'm one of Lumpy Lambert's Northeast retirees who just recently moved to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| And I didn't realize what a significant event it was for you to become chairman of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12508)|
| 3:28:34| And I didn't realize that until I read the paper the next day after last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12514)|
| 3:28:41| Having said that, I find myself in a strange position of wanting the county commission to defend me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12521)|
| 3:28:49| And the reason I say that is because people are saying, well, let's put this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12529)|
| 3:28:56| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12536)|
| 3:28:57| Let's put this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| These people admit they can raise $300,000 just to finance the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12539)|
| 3:29:05| How much do you think they're going to raise to win the election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12545)|
| 3:29:10| The other point is I have no idea what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| You people have to vet these propositions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12554)|
| 3:29:19| You have to make me understand what is going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| As I say, I'm new to this government, but the consistency provision would take me 47 days to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12564)|
| 3:29:34| And I went to school, you know, and there are eight others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| They say, oh, we don't have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| We don't have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| Give them time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12582)|
| 3:29:43| Let's give them two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| Let's really, for such a radical transformation of government in this county, let's take the time to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12585)|
| 3:29:53| Nobody seems to know how much this is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| I don't think we should vote on it until we know what the prices for these changes are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| because that money is coming out of my tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12602)|
| 3:30:07| I had some things for Ms. Hamilton, but she left, so I just want to say she's very persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12607)|
| 3:30:14| And if she had 10 people in a room, like it seems the numbers work out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12614)|
| 3:30:20| if you divide the five meetings by even 600 people and then divide the meetings into three groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12620)|
| 3:30:26| she could persuade anybody of anything, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12626)|
| 3:30:32| So as I said, the county commission is my line of defense for special interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12632)|
| 3:30:37| Commissioner Briggs, to your point on throwing out some of the items, I think it's going to go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| I think people are going to see something they like, not bother to read the other four parts of it if it gets in as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12643)|
| 3:30:50| and vote for it, and boy, there we go, down that slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12650)|
| 3:30:57| They want you to think that they raised their $60,000 by nickels and dimes like they did St. Patrick's Cathedral with the immigrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12657)|
| 3:31:04| And then I find out if you add in the Seven Island contributions, they've raised $80,000 by 16 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12664)|
| 3:31:12| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12672)|
| 3:31:13| I don't have $80,000 to fight them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12673)|
| 3:31:17| I don't have $80,000 to explain to the voters what is going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12677)|
| 3:31:22| That's why I need you people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12682)|
| 3:31:25| And I just, okay, I think I'm not going to get into the number thing more than I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12685)|
| 3:31:35| but I think their argument that this is sponsored by the people or a voice of the people is totally ridiculous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12695)|
| 3:31:42| and shouldn't even be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| There are, even if you take the 35,000 people they need for the petition, and that's 15% of the electorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12704)|
| 3:31:52| there are 210,000 voters in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| And even if you give them the 600, I don't think that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| I'm tired of bad government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| I think everybody in Knox County is tired of bad government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| But like the proverb with Esau and his brother, he was hungry, and he was tired of being hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12726)|
| 3:32:14| And he sold his birthright for a bowl of porridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| I don't want to sell my birthright to people who are telling me what's good for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12737)|
| 3:32:22| So I just appreciate you listening, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| Commissioner Lutow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12748)|
| 3:32:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12750)|
| 3:32:31| You know, we've been at it for several hours here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| And I'm starting to see us go round and round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12755)|
| 3:32:40| You know, we can debate if it's 200, 400, 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12760)|
| 3:32:44| I don't know that it really makes a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12764)|
| 3:32:49| But I'm just going to make, you know, unless there's someone else out there in the audience that wishes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12769)|
| 3:32:55| I'm going to make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| Cut your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12787)|
| 3:33:08| Both can stay down here all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12788)|
| 3:33:13| Oh, I need to let you know one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| To the new commissioners that don't have their e-mail address set up, you need to call John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12795)|
| 3:33:22| What's his number, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12802)|
| 3:33:24| Get it from Jolie because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| Elaine Davis and I are going to discuss openly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12807)|
| 3:33:31| We're going to try to have our forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12811)|
| 3:33:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12812)|
| 3:33:33| So anyone that wants to listen, we're going to be here discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12813)|
| 3:33:38| We're going to try to have our district's forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| So we can't discuss that without announcing that we're discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12821)|
| 3:33:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12828)|
| 3:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=12829)|
