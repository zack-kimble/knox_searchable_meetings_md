| 0:02:30| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| For the mayor's report, first of all, I want to make sure that everyone saw the news release we sent out last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| with the link to our annual departmental year in review report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| We produce one of these every year, and you can find the report for 2017 at the city website at knoxvilletn.gov slash year in review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=165)|
| 0:02:56| It's a very long report. It's 81 pages, and that's bulleted items mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| It gives a great overview of the variety of projects that our departments are involved in throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| and the different accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| I'm never surprised, but I'm always impressed at the amount of activity that goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| and just how much our employees and our contractors accomplish each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| So if you haven't seen it, I encourage you to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| The website includes links to the individual departments, so you don't have to read the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| just certain ones that you're mostly interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Just click on the ones that you want, and it'll take you to their part of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| I want to thank the communications department for compiling and publishing that report every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| and for all the departments for submitting all of their data and accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| It's really a great way for us to quantify the services that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| and to take a look each year and see what's been accomplished and also what continues and is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| One of the departments that are included in that report is our Police Advisory and Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| or PARC as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| They also come to council this time every year to present their own annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| PARC serves a vital function in providing independent review of any complaints or concerns about the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| as well as helping build closer ties between KPD and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| This September will mark the 20th anniversary of the creation of PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| If you look at the trends over the last 20 years of community engagement with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| and the numbers and kinds of complaints that PARC has dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| you'll see a steady improvement in all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| PARC has made a difference, and so now I would invite the chair of the board, Rosa Maher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| to come forward and to present the report and to recognize your other members who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Good evening, Mayor O'Hara, council members, Chief Roush, and other guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| I'd like to introduce Clarence Vaughn, who is the PARC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| and Lakinya Middlebrook, who is the vice chair for PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| All of you should have a copy of the report in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| I'm not going to read the whole thing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| So relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| I just want to point out the table of contents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| In it, the most important part is the, besides my letter, just kidding, report of operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| which is a demographic breakdown of all the cases that we reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| I would like to then move to page four, and I'm just going to highlight a few paragraphs in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| In 2017, PARC received 88 cases, an increase of only one case from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| PARC closed a total of 86 cases, which included two cases pending from 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| Of the closed cases, 50 were resolved by the executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| four were resolved through mediation by the executive director and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| 13 referrals were made to the appropriate agencies, and 19 were resolved by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| Despite the ongoing turmoil surrounding citizen and police divisiveness in many U.S. cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| the similarities in cases from 2016 suggest that the police community has faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| that citizen concerns and complaints against KPD are being addressed fairly and comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Despite this positive outlook, PARC pledges to maintain its vigilance in resolving issues and complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| to improve upon the relationship between KPD and the community it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Moving on to page five, in 2017, the executive director continued his service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| on the Knoxville Police Department's training committee as an avenue for citizen input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| on future training projects, as well as to continue to update KPD's recruit and in-service training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| All newly appointed PARC committee members have participated in KPD's Citizen Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| thereby all current PARC committee members have successfully graduated from the KPD Citizen's Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=428)|
| 0:07:17| Moving down to the fourth paragraph, throughout the year, the committee and the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| strive to improve coordination and communication with the Internal Affairs Unit and senior staff of the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| KPD's participation in quarterly PARC meetings, coupled with their willingness to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| and meet with citizens because of issues brought up at the meetings, continues to be excellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| and frankly, in my opinion, are a highlight of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| PARC subcommittees monitor cases wherein racial profiling may be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| as well as the utilization and effectiveness of KPD's audio-video equipment, case referrals, and transient complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| The executive director meets with KPD's Internal Affairs staff regularly to view video and audio tapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| discuss concerns, and to get clarification on specific cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| PARC's quarterly meetings in 2017 have been held in various sectors of the city as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| Arnstein Jewish Community Center, City-County Building, Wesley House Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| and the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Citizen attendance and participation has been good, and the dialogue between the committee, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and KPD has been helpful and beneficial to all participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| On a final note, please be assured that PARC strives to ensure that its procedures, operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| and communications are always courteous, respectful, and in full compliance with the Tennessee Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| as well as other statutes and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| As always, the committee welcomes any input from the mayor, from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=537)|

| 0:11:42| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Okay. We'll move on to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 17-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Jim, do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| I think there's been a suggested amendment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| What you have before you is an ordinance that you read on first reading two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| There is one amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| That is to add an additional $66,850 to the city election budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| That's to pay for the councilmanic elections last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| And that is the only change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| I would note that given the size of this, this would, unless you choose to pass it on an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| this would revert back to first reading and the law director can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| That's right. That's what he told us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| And I would move that we do pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| So first I need an amendment to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Do I do them together or do I need them separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| I just need a motion to amend it to include the additional funds related to the city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| Then I will make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And then second that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay, so first we amendment and then we need to vote on it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Okay, so the first one is to amend the ordinance to include the $66,850 for the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=798)|
| 0:13:27| Okay, and we've got a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| And so now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I would move that we do this on emergency if we can get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Okay, so now we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| So then that means that once you vote on this, then the whole thing will be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| It doesn't have to come back next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Okay, so this is on voting on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Okay, the emergency passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| So now we go back to the original motion as it has been amended two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| That's what the law director tells me we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Okay, you're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=848)|

| 0:14:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=869)|

| 0:14:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quitclaim deed to Knoxville Habitat for Humanity Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=874)|

| 0:14:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| So could I, I guess if we have any questions for Becky Wade about this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Miss Wade can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| And I got some questions from constituents at the very last minute so I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to talk to you about it in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| So the work has already started on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Apparently there's construction underway there and permits pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Is that normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| No, that's not our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Sorry, Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| No, this is a vacant lot that was a city tax foreclosed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| It's been listed in Homemakers since February of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| The only applicant we got was from Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay, that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Somebody who thought that work had started there and permits were pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| We'll certainly go look, but we haven't sold the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Because it's still under ownership by the city at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Well, in light of our discussion just two weeks ago with Habitat, do you feel that they understand that infield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| or do infield guidelines or conditions apply on what they're going to build on this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| Yes, and they've already been through infield review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Okay, so they passed that and they have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to award a total amount of $544,153.60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| in historic preservation grant awards to support property improvements to eligible historic properties within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1007)|

| 0:16:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I'd actually like to have some discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Could you pull your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| I was just concerned about these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| There are going to be a lot more funds that are left over from the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| And I know that you had put the grant period out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Eight people applied or eight businesses applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Yes, we got eight proposals this year for the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| This is the fourth year of the Historic Preservation Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| These are general fund dollars allocated, approved by council, and it's managed by the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| So the way that we handle this process is we work with our purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| They issue a request for proposals, and we did this for this round in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| We received eight proposals, and then a committee reviews the proposals and grades those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| and we are recommending six be awarded this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| What I'm hoping is that in the future that maybe communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| or we can have more applicants apply so it can be distributed a little bit more fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| Well, in years past, we've had quite a few applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| I know our second or third year, we had well over 20 proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| So I'm not sure why we had fewer this year, but, you know, it was advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| And we had to work with the proposals that we received, and we feel like we have some good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Okay, so we had a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180213?start=1125)|
