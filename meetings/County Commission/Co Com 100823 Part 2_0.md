| 0:00:00| but it's by no means a last minute effort in any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| Chris, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:09| Deferring at 30 days, is that going to hinder your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=9)|
| 0:00:13| And if so, how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:16| Well, our new permit, the permit is a cyclical permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| and some of the requirements that are directly related to the software implementation come into effect January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:29| January 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:31| So our hope is to get the software in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| There's a certain lag time involved with once the contract is signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| and we actually get work in place that if we get the contract signed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| we have a very good shot at having the work in place and the software functional by January 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:53| where we really need to have it for the permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| We'll certainly do whatever the desire of the commission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| but we've been anxious about the delay being this late coming to commission with the product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| and certainly not be comfortable waiting even another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Dick Moran?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:23| I'm going to assume or ask you, did you hear some of the concerns that Ms. Cook brought forth as far as the interface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| between this system and some others, possibly in comparing it to the Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| No, I was back in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Well, she had some concerns as to how this will interface, I guess, with other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| I'm not sure if it needs to be able to, considering it's something specific for the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| at least that's what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| But I guess your department was involved in coming up with this software and, I guess, purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| We work with the engineering public works department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| They are the drivers of this based on their functional needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| We looked at it from the contractual standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| and some of the technical standpoint from the hardware platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| and also the interface with the GIS system, which is a very strong interface there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| So you don't have any problems with moving forward on this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| No, they've met all the contractual things that we asked them to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| They've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| The vendors have accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| It's met all the bid requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Hugh's here to talk about the contractual bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| There were three bids received on this when it went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| They reviewed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| We had no problem with them, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Do you think as far as, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| it might possibly have to use your staff in order to get this software implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| And do you foresee additional costs trying to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| No, they're contracting with a third party to implement this software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| So our staff involvement is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| We're going to support the hardware end of it from our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| but we have very minimal involvement in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| As far as the bid process and the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| and the company's responsibility back to us so that if we have problems with the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| is there some type of guarantees or some contractual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| that they're going to have to fix the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| It's a standard in all of our agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And the process was managed within the guidelines of the competitive bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| which is outlined in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Mr. Law Director, I assume you've read over the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| and you feel that it protects Knox County as far as the legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| I mean, it's legally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| It provides for remedies for breach for venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| It has all the protections we require and outlines with specificity the service provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:15| Dick, as far as you know, is this a reliable company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=255)|
| 0:04:23| Yes, it's one of the leaders in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| I think all three bidders bid the same software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| And I have to defer to Engineering and Public Works from the functionality standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| because it's a canned package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| It's nothing we're developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| And I don't know if Law Director or Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| are we under any time constraints as far as getting this passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Not from our standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| It's up to Public Works and Engineering, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Well, there's nothing in the contract in terms of the proverbial drop dead date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| that if they don't sign on a certain date, it's null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| But it will take effect upon execution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Yeah, the reconsideration gave me some time to look up some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| If you look at the contract we are signing and the one for a similar community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| I found one for Gahanna, Ohio, which is near Columbus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| They're almost identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| I mean, it's a boilerplate contract that appears in both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Similar communities, Indian Trail, North Carolina, Greenville County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| all seem to have very similar contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| And with the assurances just given by Dick Moran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I feel more comfortable having had a chance to look at those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Also, I will note that this company just recently merged with TEK Science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| a firm which has specific experience in the NPDES area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| So those quick Internet findings make me slightly more comfortable with what we are encountering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| If I could, Mr. Chairman, not to interrupt the other commissioners, but on that same note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| there is a danger in one-size-fits-all boilerplate contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| That's why we always meticulously review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| This one we made sure that, for instance, venue for any conflict lies within Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| that we don't indemnify or hold harmless the private vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| And oftentimes that language is in these contracts or mandatory arbitration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| none of which appear in this particular version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| So in other words, it falls within Tennessee state law, whereas Ohio law may be different, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| Yes, we insisted that, in fact, venue lies not only in Tennessee but in this county, in our courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| in the event of breach or any kind of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I brought the motion to reconsider out of fairness to Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| I felt like that, you know, what good does it do to let her speak on an issue that's already been solved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:12| But like I said, when I brought that motion, I have a lot of faith in our IT department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| and I have a lot of faith in our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| So now I'm going to bring the substitute motion that we go ahead and approve this as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| One of the things that I sort of got off track on this also is that there's an extreme number of pieces of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| associated with this, there's 113 pages in just our agenda talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| And I sort of got an impression to begin with that this is just stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| but this is a work order system in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| This is not just stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Am I, have I got this wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| This is signs and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| The driver and the timing all comes from stormwater and our EPA permit requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| but it replaces the functional work order system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| So that's the way we, it's basically a dispatching tool that we have now that's essentially a Microsoft Access database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| that's overwhelmed and failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| So it replaces all of what Engineering and Public Works uses to manage work orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| but the primary driver and the expanded component with the GIS tie-in is related to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| Okay, but this is still a large system that's going to do a lot more than just stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I thought that's what I had picked up and what I had read of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| So given the discussion from the various departments that have been involved, what would be your response now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| My response is that I don't think you understand my points of the process, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:23| The contract may be ironclad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| The issue is really that systems have an impact on an organization that is far beyond the processing of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:38| And if you are not familiar with and have not seen cost-benefit analyses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| if you have not had the opportunity to look at a document that says this is the expectation for this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:59| this is what we anticipate the results for this to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| and this is how we are going to monitor and measure to ensure that we get those results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| it is the global perspective that I'm talking to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| The way that business gets done within Knox County, you're spending a quarter of a million dollars for a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| but it truly impacts the way you do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| And I am not saying that it isn't, as I said in the beginning, it's not an indictment of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:41| but when you have an operation that has been functioning and has known that these are requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| these EPA requirements, et cetera, you have something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| You need to be able to identify what's it taking today to do this job that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=651)|
| 0:11:00| and what is going to be different if we spend this quarter of a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| because I don't think that you recognize that it is not just this quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| You will be impacted for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| People's daily routines will change, and things will be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| And I don't know that that's the direction and that's the way that the new mayor sees that organization structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:35| I'm just saying it's not about whether the contract is ironclad, whether these people are reputable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:45| It is more about how you do business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| So, you know, someday, some way, you'll see a document presented to you that has the specifics laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=712)|
| 0:12:05| and you'll say, hmm, that's how I can make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| Do you have anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I have a substitute motion on the floor to approve as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| We get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| From the beginning to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| We have three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| 16-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| Page 17, Resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| It's approving the acquisition of 4630 Asheville Highway property for park expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| with the purchase price of $225,000 split equally between the City of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Commissioners, this is the issue that I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| I began working on a contract initially because I was advised that the purchase price was a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:34| I then learned that the appraised value was $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| So I stopped working on it and was advised by the Parks and Recreation Department they wanted to put this on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| Clearly, it's such a disparity in terms of the price that has been assessed or at least offered for sale and the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:55| So at this point, it doesn't appear that this property is going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| I would suggest you defer this for 30 days until such time as we can better assess whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| or not this is actually a benefit to the bargain for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| Well, I guess first let's get a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| But then I think there's some additional information that you may or may not be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| So I'd like to move for approval on this and we can discuss the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Commissioner McKenzie, you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| And I feel strongly about the need to act on this in an affirmative way today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:46| I don't think we need to defer this in that as we were all out there today, we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| a picture is worth at least 1,000 words, and that parcel of property is really key to us having a nice kind of a gateway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| into the city from the county, from the east sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Again, I'll say, you know, this has been a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| This has been an eight-year or more process, and this is the final piece of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| getting this property, finishing this parcel out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| I think that, well, I don't think I know, that appraisal that the law director spoke of is currently incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| In fact, the county's appraisal comes in at 140 plus, 142 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| So, you know, those numbers are, you know, and generally speaking, I'll say generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| county appraisals have not been the highest, you know, not necessarily at the upper end of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| I'll also say that, you know, the owner I think has come down off the price somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| You know, and with this property, it's going to be a cleaner property than the last piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| There were some environmental issues associated with that last piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| and this one doesn't present itself that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| So the funding can go into finishing out Tanks Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| I just really, you know, I think now is the time to finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I think we need to do it under this commission, under this mayor, and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Yeah, I just wanted to address the amount for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| My family deals a little bit in real estate, and there's different ways to evaluate a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| The way realtors do it, they look for comparables, and they say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| where's a piece of property that's similar to this, that's similar size, similar type structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| similar condition in the same neighborhood, and you're going to get a value based on comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| But there's one thing that is seldom taken into consideration is how much income is this property producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| And my understanding of this property, and I don't know who owns this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| I know very little about it except one thing that I do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I know it has tenants that are paying rent, and it has billboards that are paying rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| Because of that, this property is generating an income for whatever entity, be it corporate or personal, that owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| And I can see where they would say, before I'm going to give up $1,200 or $1,400 a month income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| I'm going to need enough money to where I can come somewhere close to generating that kind of income for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| And I can tell you, interest right now, if you're lucky, and if you've got large amounts to put into CDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| are just slightly over 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| So if we, and I'm not sure, Doug, what is the current price that the seller is at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| I guess it's 216 is what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| 216.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| If you have $216,000, and I know that sounds like a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| and you put it into a money market right now, you're not going to draw $1,200 to $1,400 a month off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| I believe that this citizen, I don't believe that they could afford to sell it for less than this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| based on the economic climate of this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| So even though by a real estate appraisal, it may look like it's a bit high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| I don't think it's too terribly out of line, because where is this person going to put the money they sell on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| and they're not going to be able to replace the income that they're getting off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| I think that it's important that we finish this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I think it's going to be a great asset to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and the fact that it's slightly over what a real estate appraisal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| I don't think is that big of a concern, because when I look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I factor in that this is income producing property for someone, and they're going to be losing that income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| So that's why I support this motion, and I hope we all will today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| This is going to be a great part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Yes, I talked to Doug about that today, and he said it was down to $216,000, like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| I'm going to vote for this, because I really feel like what we've done out there has made this property even worth more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| since the appraisal, but here's the one thing that I have against this, but I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Here, several years ago, when we bought that other property, we could have bought this property for $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| I tried to get this commission to go ahead and buy that property for that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Instead, they voted that we would pay up to $225,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| and I said at that time, well, we've just set a price on what we're going to give for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| what the people are going to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| This, I'm leaving here, and I want to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| We are running a business up here, and you have to run it like a business if you want this county to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| Now, $50,000 may not be much in our budget to some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| but that's $50,000 more that we would have had to spend out there to make this park more attractive to the people in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| But I will vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| I appreciate it, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I've looked it up and kind of thought about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| and I think the price is a little higher, more than I'm comfortable with, but I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| But I look back, and there's $3,000 worth of taxes owed on the property, Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| if we discuss that with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| He owes the city taxes and county taxes for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| It's up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| No, sir, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Doug, who gets the income for that billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| The property owner does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| And that was, as Commissioner McKenzie talked about, that was a change in the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| The original appraiser did not have that income included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| But there's a lifetime on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| So we get to keep the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| No, not for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I think like five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Can we keep it up there, though, and have revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Well, I think that would be up to Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| We're up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| The only concern I have is bringing the taxes current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| And I don't think we should enter into an agreement until the taxes are current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| But I don't mind purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| And I'll vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| And I like keeping the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| It's income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| And the income from that billboard can serve as maintenance to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| You know, in this tough economic situation, the gentleman may not have $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| so let's just deduct it from the buying price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| As long as the taxes are paid, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| As long as the law director feels comfortable negotiating that way as far as contract-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| And I don't mind adding that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| I hate for the government to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| I'm sure you can't sell a property without becoming current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| But I don't mind adding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Can we take care of that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Well, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| You know, my concern was the last information I received was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| because I was drafting a contract and I was getting ready to order a title search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| I was told appraisal is a quarter of a million, or rather the asking price is a quarter of a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| the appraisal is $80,000, put this on hold, which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| You make a business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| As long as it's not an illegal business decision, I stay out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I just want to make sure you understand from that point on, I'll negotiate the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| but I want you to make sure you're making a business decision with all the facts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And likewise, until a few minutes ago, I wasn't provided with a lot of the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| No reflection on Doug, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I know some things happened at the last minute that we weren't appraised of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| but I was just concerned because of the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Because you can understand that even in tough times, if they want a quarter of a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| and the appraisal comes back $185,000, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| When it comes back $80,000, that gives me pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| I looked on the tax records and I think it was $142,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I'd like to offer a friendly amendment, if you don't mind, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| that no more than $216,000 minus the taxes, minus back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| You might want to add in their language that the taxes be up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and prorated as of the date of closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| That sounds better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| That's more legal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Yes, I would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| No more than $216,000 and taxes become up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| Okay, we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| No, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| And the billboard in terms of, because they expect income from that billboard for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| So you're going to agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Just so I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Who gets the income from the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Well, apparently, it's my understanding at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| the seller demands the income for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| That's why I said part of the contract is he retains the income for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| After that, that comes to us and we can dispose of that how we wish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| That changes my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I thought we were taking over the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Commissioner McKenzie, how long was that contract for the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Doug, I'm going to look to you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| I don't know if I have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I don't know what the information is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| My opinion is I can't vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| I can't vote on something that you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I didn't know we were losing income for the five years for the billboard that's going to be on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| And he's already getting $80,000 above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Is the seller here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| No, sir, I don't believe he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| I'd like to withdraw my friendly amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| The five-year handwritten note that I see in the agenda is the thing I was going to question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:14| But first let me back up and say if the seller is from $225,000 down to $216,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| and requesting the income off the billboard for five years, the expense to Knox County is just $108,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| Am I right in that math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Or is the city still going to pay the $112,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| I'll let Doug address that, but I think the city has already made their commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| and they're fine with whatever we decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| I don't think they're going to ask for additional income back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| The city has actually already given us half the money for the original $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| So are we only coming up with the difference to make it up to $116,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Excuse me, $216,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| I would actually defer to the city on their philosophy of that, whether we still split it in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| or whether we have the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| I would still be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| It's split equally on the deal here, so we'd have to give it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| But, well, splitting it equally would even be paying less if they still maintained their $112,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| I wouldn't be splitting it equally, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| It would be less for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Not if you split it equally, if the people are getting $216,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| You're all missing what I'm saying then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| The question I really have is about the five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| If on the five-year contract for the billboard they're wanting the income, whose property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Would they still have a property tax for that billboard since it's income producing for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| Would we lease them the spot for their billboard to stand on this county park property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Yeah, that's a tax question that I certainly could not answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Commissioner Wright, to follow up with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| the law director may be able to answer whether or not that would still be considered a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| and therefore be subject to personal property tax, would have to pay personal property tax on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| I don't know if the law director could answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| That might be where you're trying to go with that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| That's exactly where I'm trying to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| If they still have personal property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| even though they're getting the five-year income off of the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| if it's personal property, then they're still paying tax on it, which is okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Yeah, I mean, it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Again, I don't normally delve into commission business of this nature because, again, it's a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| But there's so many unknowns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| It's troubling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| You know, there's a lot more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| There's no reflection on Doug, but we've never negotiated face-to-face with the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| And that's what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| Could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| One last little pause from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| I think that I'm still comfortable with a $108,000 cap on passing the resolution today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| I serve on the board with Doug for Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Doug, do we have a billboard in any of our parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| And knowing the makeup of our board, I can't see that that would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I would think the committee over the years, they would want to take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Here's what I go back to what Commissioner Pinkston said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Folks, number one, guys in the first district, I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| I want to, to me, it's finishing the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I think it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| But when our law director comes in and says that it's appraised at $80,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| and our tax records show $42,500, guys, I cannot spend $216,000 on a 42,000 piece property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| $142,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Well, still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| That's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| I just wrote down $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| So it's $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| I can't spend that kind of money just like Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| You know, these are taxpayers' dollars that we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| It's not like we've got a magic person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Our money is unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Our constituents, things are tight for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| And I think it needs to be tight for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| And we act like we've got all the money in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| You know, Doug, I think we need to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I don't want to spend more than what something is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| So I'm not going to be voting for it, for monetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| Commissioner Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I feel this is a great park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| We were all out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| It is a great park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| It will be greater with this addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| Rarely in the two years I've sat here have we heard a law director say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| I recommend against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| I don't recall it happening, but I count it on one hand for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| And also, and I'm a real estate expert, but in a downed real estate market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I think that's pretty much universally agreed to pay almost triple the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| So it worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| However the billboard income goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| I see Jim York back there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Are you here for this, Jim, or for the urban forest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| I was going to ask if the city is comfortable paying three times the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| but I guess you're not prepared to answer that, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| I'm very uncomfortable with the numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| I want that park, and I will support the expansion of that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| but these numbers are a little bit out of line to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| What are the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Because I'm hearing three times the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| and $216,000 isn't three times $144,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I thought appraised was $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Let's stop talking about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| The appraised value is $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| As Doug said, the billboard issue wasn't taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| So let's forget about $83,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| The appraised value is $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| The county appraisal is $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Well, you're talking about just $74,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| So we're not talking about three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| I think the law director threw out an $80,000 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Well, initially it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| The last figure I received, it was $80,000 and a quarter of a million out of the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Then now we're learning that the $80,000 wasn't correct because we didn't factor in the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| but for the first five years the billboard revenues go to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| And I just want to be clear, Mr. Chairman, and I'll sit back, but I'm not against you purchasing a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| I just am not comfortable with you negotiating a contract as we go along in a public venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| The correct way to do it, and, again, no reflection on Doug, information keeps coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| you should have a cogent, negotiated contract, and then that's what you should vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| But we're negotiating as we go along with an owner who's not even standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| But in terms of the wisdom of getting the park, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| I mean, that's exactly what we're in the business for is to supply those kind of services to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| I'm just not very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| We're negotiating as we go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| and we don't even know if the seller is going to be interested in any of these terms and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| That's $15,000 for five years is all that billboard's bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| It's bringing in $250 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| So that's $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Five years is $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I believe that the park would look better without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| And I believe the owner of the property, if, well, I don't want to say if he had any sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:15| but if it was mine, I'd sell it and get rid of the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| And I think it would improve the looks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Let me tell you, I went out through there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| It's the first time I've been that way in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| That area right there has really come back alive on Asheville Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| And everybody here knows I'm a conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| And it's just a big improvement, even the park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| but not the park, the buildings, and everything out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| There were some issues that were brought up that kind of have to agree with Law Director Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| There are some answers that we don't have at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| For example, if, in fact, we end up being able to tax this particular billboard as personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| then the billboard itself will probably, unless negotiated within the four corners of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| belong to the person who actually has the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Then when that lease runs out, it's incumbent upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Maybe they may want to choose to move that billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| And we may not have anything, if we're wanting income off of it, to even have income off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| I mean, you're talking my neighborhood just right up the street, and it's a beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| I want to support it, but I have to defer to the law director right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| because I think there's too many unknowns out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| and we have to negotiate this within the contract to make it effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| And I'm not really sure what I'm voting on other than a dollar figure right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| What are we going to get out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| And what's going to happen with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| And who's going to own what when we're through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| And so it's just really not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| And it really disturbs me because I really think this is a really great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| I really do, and I want to see it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So I'm not really sure how I'm going to vote on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| That billboard, Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| You're in the tax office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| That won't bring in $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| You're in taxes, will it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Well, I'd have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Well, first of all, you'd have to have Phil Ballard here put an assessment on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| and then whatever that figure is will determine ultimately by 30% since it's personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| take 30% of the value and then you multiply that times the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| So I don't know how much of a value that the solicitor's office would place on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| Mr. Ballard, pardon me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Who does the billboard belong to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Well, it would belong to the property owner, but once you buy the property, I guess that's just a piece to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| The billboard actually belongs to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Now, you're sure he's not being paid for it being put on his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| What you would do on that, if he retains ownership and you want him to pay tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| then you just divvy out a little piece of the property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| and actually that's a commercial piece of property for radio signal towers, billboards, and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:26| So it would probably be taxed at 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| But what kind of value, you know, you can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| You know, it's always on income, cost, or market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| So you're not going to get a lot of money off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| The cleanest thing to do would be buy it, and then the billboard would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| He got a year off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| You know, could I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Could we consider this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I'm going to ask you all to consider this and make it easy for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Hopefully he's listening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| We go to 225, billboard issue goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Because I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I mean, all the issues come up with the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| That's kind of, could we go back to the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Because I'm assuming, I don't assume, I know that Doug wanted to renegotiate because we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| I am concerned with the original 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| So once, you know, I think we're in a better position now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| So let's, could we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| I thought we didn't have a substitute motion, or I would make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| You can change the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| So could we go to 225, we retain rights to the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| up to Doug and the county commission to handle the billboard how we handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| That way we get out of this taxing of a structure on the county property piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| There's not a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I didn't think so, but someone said that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| What you had is you had Brad Anders ask for a friendly amendment to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| and he withdrew that, which dealt with the property tax situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Can I, I guess I, can I make a substitute motion and I make the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| So could I ask someone else to do that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| No, Sam, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Well, what kind of motion are you wishing to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Sam, you have the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| You have the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Okay, here's what I'd like to change the original motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Again, based on this conversation, based on the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| and I think Commissioner Pinkston's calculations are right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| it ended up being a better deal for us anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| based on the $15,000 worth of income over the five years or whatever it ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Could I make the, I want to change my original motion to we offer $225,000 for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| It's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| I think the law director can clean up any of the contractual type issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| I agree that we did put in a bunch of kinks and loopholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So I think this cleans all of that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| We offer the original asking price of, I mean, selling price of $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| We've gotten $112,500 from the city, and we'll put in the other half and we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| Could you add in there the property taxes to be current and prorated as of the day of closing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| So if my second could agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Sam, there's one thing I'd like to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I don't know what kind of contract this gentleman has with Lamar or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| but that billboard may have to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| And if it does, the county should get the money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Oh, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| With this new one, no, that billboard becomes a property owner, which is not the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| I'll go along, Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Brad, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| If that's $3,000 a year, that's $15,000 less we're buying it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| And actually, if we give $225,000 for it, get $15,000 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| We're getting it for $210,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| But if there's any issue, the only problem I have is we're voting on a contract we haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| We need to write it up the way what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| We're voting on a contract that we haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So if it's anything besides us totally taking acquisition of the land and the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| the taxes being paid, and the $225,000, I want it to kick back to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| I want to approve this today for all of the reasons that have been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| I think we all agree this is a great project and this is the last piece that needs to be put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| Definitely we all want to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| This is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| My concern is that, the same as Brad's, that we're voting on a contract that hasn't been worked out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| I personally would prefer to defer this until we have the actual contract in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| And part of that is because I do have a problem with paying much more than the appraised price for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| because we've got people coming in here right now who want us to build them a school that we can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| We just last, a couple weeks ago, talked about a safety center, building a safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| that we can't afford to build and we can't figure out where the money is going to come to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| So this isn't the time, as much as we want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| and all agree that it's a very worthwhile, great thing that this community deserves and that we should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| this is not a time to be spending money that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| When we say that we don't have money to build a safety center, we don't have money to build a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| but we're going to pay more than an appraised value price for land for a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| And I just want us all to think about that very carefully right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| in terms of what else we have on our plate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| So I would prefer that we defer this for 30 days and see what kind of contract Joe and Doug can work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:18| and see if we can't get something that's a little bit cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| a little bit more in line with the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| And I'm not saying that this isn't important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| This is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And I absolutely am in favor of moving forward with this as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| But I don't want to spend more than we ought to for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| And this property isn't going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| And there's not going to be anybody else interested in buying it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| So I think that we could safely defer it for at least 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| and see if we couldn't come up with a better contract that we could have right in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| before we vote on it based on the other things that we have on our plate right now that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| And I really hope that the first district will understand that I am not opposing this in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| I want this park completed, and I want it completed as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| But I just want to make sure that financially we're doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| with the tax dollars that have been entrusted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Apparently from the discussion we've got appraisal issues, we've got tax issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| we've got income issues, and we've got contract issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| And it just seems logical to me to resolve some of these before we take the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| I would like to ask Mr. McKenzie if, you know, and everybody, it seems to be in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| Everybody seems to be in agreement about the park and the value of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| and how this is a valuable addition and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| I'm just wondering about the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Is that an onerous burden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And if it is, why is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| So if I could, I could just ask Mr. McKenzie that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Well, in my mind, I think that there are obvious reasons that I would like for this to be done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| I won't make any guarantees, but Commissioner Pinkson is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| We set the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| The former commission set the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Okay, so and we can't compare a $50,000 bump compared to an $8 million bump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| I think that's not fair to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| I think if we look back historically, you know, and I'm not saying anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| I don't want the county to be everyone's bank, and I don't think that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| If you look at the other piece of property, it ended up selling for one piece sold for $125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:15| but they were all $200,000, the other piece, and we had a bunch of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| So to say that something's going to happen in 30 days, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| As Commissioner Lambert said, you know, this gentleman, he knows the value of his price, I mean, of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:38| We basically set it for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| So what we have to look at is the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| We have to look at this is a vital cog to a lot of positive things that are happening in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:53| You know, so when we talk values, we talk, you know, dollars and cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and fairly small dollars and cents when you're trying to compare it to, you know, an $8 million swing here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| I think that's what we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| People, I don't think the appraisal, the new appraisal is the new appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| The county assessment is the county assessment, so I don't think there's wide swings left or right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I think there was probably a hastily done appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I don't know if there was a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I don't know all these things were left off, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| The new appraisal has come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I think we know what our new appraisal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| But, again, if we were out there today, if we looked at it, I mean, I think it's a vital piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| In 30 days, I know nothing's going to happen in 30 days as far as the financial aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:54| With that said, I'd like to ask Sharon Davis if she'd come and she can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Mr. McKenzie, I still have the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| The only other question that I have is for the law director then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| Mr. Jarrett, could you speak to the appraisal process that revealed the 80K number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| The only information I received, sir, that the initial appraisal came back at approximately $80,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| because it didn't take into consideration the possible revenue generating billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| I haven't seen an updated appraisal since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| But, you know, again, I'm going to move forward what the commission tells me to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| I'll order a title search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| We'll make sure there's an environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I'll draft a contract for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| But my only concern is there are a lot of unknown variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| and I owe it to you to give you a contract that's legally defensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and takes into consideration all of the variables involved in this purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Because, again, it's an oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| You've got a revenue generating billboard of the structures, et cetera, that you have to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Just based on that, and I think in deference to Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| I just think it would be, given all the things that we've got before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| I think it would be wise to have a 30-day deferral, and I'll make that a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:22| We have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I think that all of us have bought a house, we've bought a car, we've bought a boat, piece of property, something of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| When we did that, we had a contract, and we looked at that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| We either read it ourselves or we had someone else read it for us to make sure that it was what we had said it was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| and that there wasn't anything in there that looked a little funny and that it was fair to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| What we have before us here is we don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| We, frankly, don't know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| We have a resolution before us, but we do not have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| No one on this commission that I'm hearing is against purchasing the property of this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| I am in favor of having a contract in front of me to read and that has been reviewed by the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| and that has been negotiated with the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| So I am prepared to vote next month when we have a contract in front of us in favor of purchasing that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| I'm not in favor of voting on it today without something in front of me to look at and know exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| I will take a little bit different tact on the billboard, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and say that if it's possible for Knox County to keep that billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I'll look at the traffic count that goes on that highway every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| What an opportunity to promote what's going on in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| to promote what's going on with our parks and our recreation and events in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| So I would just make that as something to consider because you're looking at an advertising vehicle that could be beneficial to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=2993)|
| 0:50:03| I know that there are those who see billboards as an eyesore and I'm not going to get into that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| However, as a user of billboards, I do know that they are effective and that they work and it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| So I would just say that that's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| However, I'm going to support the substitute motion that we instruct the law director to negotiate a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| And next month when we come in, we'll know what the deal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Commissioners, I'd just like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Again, I want to apologize for some of the confusion here because it's not in my nature to bring you something that's not fully ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| However, the joint project between the city and county, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| I want to remind everybody that half the funding is coming from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| was put together with the community and in particular Councilman Della Vopi of leading the charge to finish off this one remaining parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| to really complete this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| When the original appraisal came through, we sent that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| We just had the reappraisal come through this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| As a matter of fact, we are out at the park opening, so that's why that information was a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| And unfortunately, the appraiser who done through PBA actually discussed this directly with the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| but he didn't mention the billboard at the time, and so unfortunately that was missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| So, again, the appraisal right now as it stands is $120,000, but the county appraisal was $143,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Councilman Della Vopi and I also went and met with the property owner to say, here's an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| We know it's going to come up some, but we didn't know exactly how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| We had a good guess, and we guessed right about on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| So coming down to $216,000 was the best he was willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| So I think in terms of any future negotiations, I think he is where he is on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| So I think maybe just in summary, there's three values here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| The appraised value is certainly something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| And as Commissioner McKenzie pointed out, we paid $200,000 for one of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| The difference in the appraised value is because all the land is about the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| The difference is actually the building square footage, which unfortunately we tear the buildings down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| so they have zero value to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| So you've got three parcels here that have had different appraisals, but to us it's exactly the same value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| So I think when you look at it from the property owner's eyes, as Commissioner Lambert would point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| you know, he especially looked at not only his income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| as well as the fact that we had paid $200,000 for an adjoining or an adjacent property that was about the same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| plus we paid money for an environmental cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| So I think just trying to sum it up there in a nutshell of what happened here and what's transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| And then, finally, I think the big issue is obviously the value of the parks to the community is a key piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| And, again, I think our negotiations with the landowner indicate that this is his price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| And I think the substitute motion at $225,000 I would certainly think would be acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| considering that's the original price, you know, if that's the will of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| Yes, Sharon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you. I'm Sharon Davis, 414 Hoston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| I enjoy living in East Knoxville, and I hope that I answered some of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| I can understand how you would be confused with all the different information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Let me add that the piece of property that adjoins the subject property did sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Some of you gentlemen on commission were party to that purchase, and I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| And it's important to go ahead and complete this part today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We only have half of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| There was three partials originally designed in this triangle that lays between Hoston Drive and Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| And I can tell you all how to clean it up, how we've done that, and how we got where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| But, nevertheless, the piece of property that is the subject today, 4630 Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| that piece of property adjacent to that just a few years back sold for $200,000, 207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| It may be on your record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| What I know that the appraiser didn't know and what I'd like to share with you today is that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| on your information, shows 3,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| This property, subject property, is 1,500-something square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| The appraiser didn't know that half of that 3,300 square feet property was a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| So he didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| There was no way for him to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| So I would ask you today to please consider completing this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| There's no need to put it off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| We have all the information that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| The seller has been spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| The contract has been negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Mr. Battelle spoke with him last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| He is where he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| The value is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| And there are several ways to come up with an appraisal besides comps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| The income, there are several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| So I would ask you today, do the right thing and complete this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| And I also want to thank you all and tell you I've enjoyed hearing these resolutions today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| to honor the commissioners and Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| It was an honor to get to hear that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| And I would ask you, as you commissioners are leaving today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| to finish this project that was started in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| This is the third piece to finish our park in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Is there any questions I can help answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| And I know that our law director can write up a contract in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| Miss Davis, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| I keep hearing this talk about no contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Now, Mr. McKenzie, you correct me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| My understanding is that you want the law director to draw up a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and present it to this man at X amount of dollars and if he signs it okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| And if he doesn't, okay, we start back over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Miss Davis, the billboard brings in $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| The property now is appraised at $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| The $3,000 brings it up to $145,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Is this property rented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| I don't know what to rent, but I would say it would have to bring $500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| It brings $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| There's another $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Plus the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Well, I've got the billboard in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| This property is a hundred and that brings it up to worth $167,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:38| and not giving the gentleman anything for his profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Now, when you take the $210,000, we get the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| We're going to buy it for $225,000, but we get the money for the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| which is $3,000 for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| That brings it down to $210,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| We're only paying about $25,000 more than the appraisal on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| Now, the contract, like I said, the way I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| everybody keeps talking about we don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| We don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Mr. McKenzie is wanting the law director to draw this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| With these figures, at $225,000, we get the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| and we have to give the man something above his property, what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Now, like I said, and I said this before, you set the price on it about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| and, Ms. Davis, you were here and you heard me say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I said we need to buy this property for $175,000 right now while we've got to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| And this commission, most of them here, voted to pay up to $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| Well, now that's what we're sitting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Now, we're either, and I would think, when we were talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I'm sure I didn't realize the property had this kind of income coming in on it and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| but I don't see any reason not to go ahead and vote for the law director to draw this contract up with these figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| And if a gentleman don't sign it, you start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| And he understands he has to pay his back taxes, and we all understand we're going to have a clear title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| That's the only way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Those back taxes probably have some penalties in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Well, it's just a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| But, I mean, I understand, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| He's going to pay 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| He's aware to pay those at closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| That's the way we all do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| I'm just still a little bit uneasy with this, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| And I'll do respect, Ms. Davis, what you're wanting to do in trying to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| You know, you're speaking on behalf of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| You know, and I told a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Well, you're talking about, you know, how much he makes on income for the billboard and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| You do not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| That's between him and the billboard company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| So, I'm just real uncomfortable with what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Larry Doug said $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Doug's the one that said $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| He checked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Doug said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Doug Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Well, I'm just uncomfortable with what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| I think you're going to get the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| But I think what we owe it to the taxpayers to make sure that we're doing the right thing, Ms. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| and doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| I'm not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| And I'll say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| As a member of the Parks and Recreation Board, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| unless they do what Mr. Hammond was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| I would think that the park board would take a billboard down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| We have no billboards in any of our parks here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Now, they may decide that's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| That's fine for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Doug may have a strong feeling about it one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Doug leads that group and, Doug, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| I got to remind you, that's an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| They don't set a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| But I just feel so very uncomfortable with spending, in this economic time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| spending money way above what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Well, I appreciate your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And I'm a very conservative individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| But the price is not going to go down 30 days or two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| It may even go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Well, if I want to go over and buy that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I'm going to look at what it sells for on the tax row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And if it's selling for $142, I'm not going to offer the guy $225 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Who else in Knox County is going to offer him $225 when appraised at $142?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| Somebody that wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| If you pay for the price, if what you think it's worth, you may never get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| Well, you know, we can go out here and buy stuff all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| But we have hardly any money in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| These are tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| And if we have to let that little corner go, we have to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| There's other things that Knox County needs too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I stand there and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| We have the motion on the floor to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| Commissioner Lambert, substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Yeah, I am still speaking on behalf of the original motion and against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| The price is not going to change on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| Everyone I've talked to, I've talked to Doug, I've talked to this lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| this person seems very firm on their price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| We have three choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We can forget the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| We can forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| We don't have to have a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| And a lot of us are sitting up here, well, it's not in my district, I'll never go to that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| I don't think that's a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| I don't think that's a good option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I think this is a good park, and while people in my community may not be using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| it is going to benefit Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| So I'm taking that option off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And I know I'm only here for a few more hours, but as long as I'm here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| I'm going to stand for these folks to have a nice park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| My community just got a nice park a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| and I'm going to stand for this community to get a nice park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| The other option is we could pay what the person, the negotiated price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| and I believe that they have negotiated it to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| And, honestly, if this was a piece of my property, I would prefer to keep the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| because it's income generating property, and I would rather have that income for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| rather than sell a piece of property and have to pay capital gains on any money that I made on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| if I'm that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| I would hope that this commission would do exactly what it's doing and not buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| because I believe I would prefer that monthly income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| That monthly income means more to me than that money in the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| and I'm sure it probably does to this property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| But we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| We can forget about the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| I'm not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| We can pay what the negotiated price, and we're not in the beginning of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| We're on the tail end of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| And, yes, we've done a little negotiating tonight, but that's just cleaning up the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| I think we're where we're at, and I don't think in 30 days it's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Now, the third option we could do, and I'm sure there's some folks out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| that aren't quite as against eminent domain as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| We could use eminent domain, and that is absolutely something that this government has the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| It will tie it up for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Gentlemen may get a stay of saying, well, you know, the property doesn't change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| No buildings can be torn down until this is settled, and we can push this off for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| And then when the person goes into court and they get to argue about what value it is, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| They can say they paid my neighbor this much for this property, and Knox County will ultimately lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| I am not a lawyer, but I know that based on the evidence that this person can give to a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| I'm making this much money off my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| They paid my neighbor this much money for the property, and now they're only wanting to give me this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| In a courtroom, we will probably lose and be forced to pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| probably not what they're asking for it now because there's a little thing coming down the pipe called economic recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| and that property may be worth more money by the time an eminent domain case is finally heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| So our choice really here today is do we forget about the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Do we use eminent domain for the first time in this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Or do we pay them what they're asking for it, which based on the income that it's producing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| I don't think they're too far out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| I'd like to get it for less, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for this kind of compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| for property that's generating this kind of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| And that's why I support the original motion, and that's why I'm going to vote against the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| because I don't think anything's going to change in 30 days, and I see no reason that we should punt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| I think we need to sit in these seats, and we need to do our job today, and we need to approve this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| First off, we don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| We can't write a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| We can make an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| And even if this commission does make an offer tonight that we all agreed upon, or at least ten of us do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| the gentleman that's wanting to sell this to us, the owner, would have to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| And then this commission would have to come back at some point in time and accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| So we're still back to next month, regardless of what we would like to do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| because we do not have a contract to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| This commission will have to come back and approve whatever comes back to us through the negotiating process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| So I'm speaking in favor of the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| I would like to probably maybe add to it, if the maker of the deferral motion would put in language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| to have Doug and maybe the law department to come up with a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| and have it negotiated and presented to commission at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| until we have it, we really don't have anything to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| We can make an offer tonight, but we can't offer a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| It's still coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Craig made the point that I was going to make and also wanted to make certain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| Mr. Davis, I understand what your community has gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| In our neighborhood, we've been working ten years on a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| and it's a much smaller park than what you all have got going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| I've been out there to see this property, and you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| And all of us agree this needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| This park needs to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| I just think that, and we've had comments on how we need to run the county like a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| and while that's a completely different argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| it's not good business to vote on a contract that you don't have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| So I really understand exactly how you feel on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| and I agree that we need to move forward as quickly as we can on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| and Commissioner McKenzie, I understand completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| We need to do this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| We all are in agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| But I just think we need to wait 30 days until we have that contract in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| As Craig pointed out, it's still going to be that long because we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| we don't have a contract tonight to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| We can make an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| It's still got to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| It's still going to take that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| What I hear you saying is that you don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| Would you vote tonight and have a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| if the man accepts the contract at a particular figure, that you would go forward on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Who said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| You can't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| You have to have a contract and vote on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| No, I don't know if that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Mr. Law Director, can you answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| I think I have the floor, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Do I not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| You have the floor, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| And I believe that Ms. Davis had a question that I think actually the Law Director needs to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| The Commission is going to have to approve the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| The problem is there are too many variables and too many potential to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| You can only, you can direct me to move forward to negotiate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| but you need to have a signed contract or an executed contract for your approval before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| before this becomes a viable purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| So the question is, could the Commission direct the Law Director to write a contract for a particular figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:14| and then have him to present that contract to the seller and come back then with a signed contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:24| How else could it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| That's what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Come back with a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| We would still have to vote on it again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| On the signed contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| But I would ask that you vote tonight for the Law Director to write a contract at a particular number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| and present that contract to the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| I would ask that you do that tonight on a particular figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Otherwise, we're nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| We're right back to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| That's what he's asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| That's what Ms. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I believe that's what Commissioner McKenzie has been trying to get done for the last 45, 50 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| I mean, he's wanting them to draw up a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| If the guy doesn't sign it, okay, nothing lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| That's all he's directing the Law Director to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Because there's no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| I mean, the variables are the price, paying the taxes, plain title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| What else is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I did have another question, though, for Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Has a study been done on the environmentals yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Are we going to have to do any cleanup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| No, the tanks have already been removed, and we have a letter from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| I am still in favor of I want to see a contract before I vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| I want the Law Director to negotiate the contract, and I want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| I don't want to set a price tonight and say go send this contract and then bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| And I really hope that I'm not going to get a whole bunch of ugly e-mails saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| why don't you support our park, because I think everyone up here supports this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| I think what we're saying is that with everything else on our plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| we want to make sure that we're doing the best thing we can for all the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| I appreciate that, and we don't send ugly e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| I would like still, I mean, when the Law Director goes to the gentleman with a contract to negotiate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:29| he has to have a figure on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| The seller has been talked to for years, and this is the first time that he has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| this year, since February, has come up with this price at 225 and keeps the five years on the sign, the income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:52| Then he came down to 16 just last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| The Parks and Recreation Division spoke with him, talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| and as Doug stated a moment ago, he does feel like the seller is very firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| There's different ways to come up with appraisals and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| I think we've been all through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| It is a fair price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| He has a good income producing property, and he, you know, if you want the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| then you need to go with the 225 to the gentleman and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| The $225,000, Doug, the county's parts, 112,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| One of the things that's not been asked, where's that coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| That is in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| It's in the county's capital plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| It was included in the budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| I would ask, what difference does it make whether we say we cap at 112,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| or whether we defer for 30 days and wait for the buyer or the seller to come back with a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| We're still in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| If we indicate our intentions to be at 112,500, I see no problem with us doing that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I, you know, as Sharon said earlier, this isn't a 30-day negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| This has been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| This is not a motivated seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| So let's get that fully understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| And I think Sharon said in the audience, I mean, 30 days, it may go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And where are we then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I'd like to comment on two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| And that's one, and I do appreciate Commissioner Pinkston trying to say that's what I've been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| All I'm asking, we write up a contract that sets a price at 225, we get the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| we do whatever we want to with the billboard, and we walk away from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| I think having a contract that the Knox County Commission has given a number to is a motivator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| So why do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Why do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Because chances are you'll come back next month with a signed contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| You don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| You go back in this nebulous negotiation phase and, you know, everything comes back on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| The price was set three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Guys, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, that's going to be the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| And then the second part is, you know, Commissioner Smith said, well, we just forget about that little corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| And we have to look at this thing in its fullness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| And, you know, that community, my community, when we were building libraries all over the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| I think Hall's got a nice library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Powell has a beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Carnes has a nice facility, as well as Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Carter would get new senior citizen centers and new libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| My community and we have done a good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| We got a Walmart and a Payless shoe store transforming into a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| And it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| No complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| But that's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| We got to reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| We got a John T. O'Connor add-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| We'll throw some money in and we'll reuse that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| So to throw away that little corner, when this community has sacrificed and waited and said we'll get what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:47| maybe not the Cadillac, but we'll take those lemons and make lemonade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| And that's what that park is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| That was two night clubs and a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| And so we've really opened that community up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Things are looking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Things are positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| So I don't want to throw that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| We can talk numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| The numbers aren't going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| What's going to happen is this is going to go away and we'll be trying to do this two and three and four and five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| So I strongly urge you all, let's act today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| We've been through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Numbers have been thrown left and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Here's a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| 225 or we walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| We come back next month, we approve it, or the law director wasn't able to do it and he doesn't bring anything back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| So, you know, that's what my original motion is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| Let's act on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| I do think 30 days, one, it won't do anything with the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| We set the terms in the contract, 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| We get the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Soup to nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| He pays his taxes and comes home at whatever date we close on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| So, please, consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Consider what I've said today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Consider everything that you've heard today in its fullness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Just a quick question for the law director or just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| And, Doug, just to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| I don't own a billboard, but I know several of us here advertise on billboards at election time and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| And I know it's a lot like our campaign signs was up for months and months and months, even after the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| even though we weren't paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| They just didn't have anybody to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Before we sign a contract, I'd want to know from the billboard company, if they're not receiving income from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| do they pay the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Do they get money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Because if it's for 12 months and only actually nine months somebody pays on that billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| would we get nine months of income off of that or do we get the full year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| I'd want that answered by whoever, if it's Lamar or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Do you own a billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I've owned them before and it's for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| I owned one back in 1980 and it was $2,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| I thought this billboard would probably bring in more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Well, this is 30 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| It's 30 years later, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| I'd like for it to be checked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| I get to do due diligence what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| They will pay you for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| That's the way it's contracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| That's part of the law director's negotiation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| If we give him a figure, that's what he goes to, and no more, and then bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| We can't just take it and do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| We've got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| My light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| It's been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| We didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| We didn't get a second to this call to the question, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| What I was going to say is this property's appraised at $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| This property's bringing in $15,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| I hope whoever owns this property is not listening to this county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| because I feel like if I owned it and hearing this going on after it's jogged my memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| that I'm bringing in $15,000 a year, I wouldn't want to sell it for the $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| You can't make that kind of return on your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Now, what you have to look at is this gentleman's not going to be getting $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| Regardless, we don't know how much capital gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| We don't know what he's paid on this and what his capital gain is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| He may just be walking out with $150,000 or $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| We're just guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| I don't know what he bought and paid for it, but I would suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| and, Lord, I was against this, you know, that we voted on it several years ago to pay up to $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:45| So you know the gentleman's not going to take any less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| And I think Commissioner McKenzie has addressed this properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| The things have been ironed out that he's asking the law director to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| and all he's doing is asking him to draw up this contract that we pay no more than $225,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| and we keep the billboard and the taxes are paid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| To defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I thought this was to give the law director a chance to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| It's just a full deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Which would defer it 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Put it off 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Well, the motion is defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| I asked the maker of the motion if they would include within their deferral that this be negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| and brought back before this commission next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| So who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Would you accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Will the second accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| That the contract comes next month to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| That the contract be negotiated and brought back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| That converts it to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Sam, is that what you're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| What's the difference in the two motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Because we have to have an executed contract versus just making an offer that we then have to then try to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| or not approve at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Either way, it's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I'm just asking if the second is willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| And Tony wants to keep it open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| And Tony, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| This isn't open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| And you guys not get together because you're so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| I mean, if you think about what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Do you have a problem with the offer that Sam wants to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| I've already made the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And given the reason for the substitute motion, I'm staying with those reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| And you accepted my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| And did the second accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Will you accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Let's hear the motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| I've heard so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| It's just a deferral for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| But it's asking that the park and the law departments negotiate out this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:03| and bring back a contract next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Not tell them the terms or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Just bring back the contract so that this commission can then at that point consider a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| Not tell them the price or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Not tell them the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Negotiate it out and then bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| And then we vote on it next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| And then the commission votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Is everyone clear on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=4957)|

| 1:23:56| Motion fails 11 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Would you like me to restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Did you say that, Commissioner Hannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Restate it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| The original motion is to drop a contract selling price of $225,000 to be written up by our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:19| and hopefully signed and bring back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| That's the county keeping the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| That is the complete sale of the property, and all taxes and things need to be brought up to date prior to sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:36| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Now, you all understand that if they change one word of that, he still wants five years on the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:53| He wants to own that little parcel of the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Anything, it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| So we're basically back to what we just voted against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| This is a strong statement to the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| You're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| So, like we said, the second appraisal, the details just came in this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| So it's entirely possible that something as unyet foreseen may pop up in the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| Now, if that happens, are we going to give the law director and the parks department latitude to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:32| or it's just going to null and void the whole thing and it's all going to have to come back again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Oh, just one quick question to the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Does your motion include about the property taxes being current and prorated as the date of sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| Yes, he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Yeah, I just want to make sure that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| And we, meaning the county, get the proceeds from the billboard, not the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| The way we get the property, soup to nuts, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| There's no terms and leases or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Amy, you're talking about the appraisal that came in this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| What did that appraisal, what did it appraise at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| No, 142 is the county assessment appraisal done by Phil Ballard's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| That's the 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| The appraisal that came in this morning came in at 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| The county's appraisal is 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| The original appraisal that did not include the income from the billboard was the 80-whatever that we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:47| that's not even worth considering at this point because it was a completely flawed appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| So, the county assessment is 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| The appraisal that came in this morning is 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| But appraisals are for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| They do not include a going business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| That's what needs to be taken into consideration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Yes, appraisals do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| But the going business will be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I'll offer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| I just can't in good conscience give double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| There's been a call in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| But I still had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| With a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I don't think you ever had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| He had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Ross had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| You know, Sam, I want you to have your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| And I think you're going to get your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| But I just, you know, in good conscience can't give 225 for something bad at 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| And they talk about a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| You know, Mr. Pinkson talks about, well, we've got $15,000 coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| What's it going to make from the stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| That bill is going to be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Is that not right, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| I mean, so how can you count that we're going to get $15,000 out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| That's what he's getting out of it, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| That's what he's getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| We're getting ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Doug won't be keeping that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| He'll be tearing that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| I certainly hope so if he's going to put a partner in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5283)|

| 1:33:22| 5-H-10-RZ is an appeal by Laurel Investments LLC of MPC's denial of rezoning from A Agricultural to CN Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:33| The property is located southwest side of Choteau Road, southeast side of North Shore Drive in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5613)|

| 1:33:49| Seeing none, 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Mr. Chairman, I was going to ask from the 5th District if we could hear MPC's report on this because MPC voted to deny, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| If we could hear that report, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| Commissioner, this is a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| It's an appeal of an MPC denial of rezoning from A Agricultural to CN Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| The location of the request was property that is at the intersection of North Shore Drive and Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:28| This came up to MPC back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| There was a sector plan amendment, and if I may, I might take this time to explain a couple of things before I proceed with the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:46| If you're so inclined, you can proceed with approving or substantiating the denial of MPC's request of the CN Neighborhood Commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5686)|
| 1:35:01| In other words, deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| The state law that was approved a couple of years ago with regard to planning and approval of general plans and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:13| laid down some specific requirements with regard to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Any zoning that comes before you has to be consistent with a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| In this case, MPC chose to denial the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| He cannot appeal that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| He can only appeal the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| So one choice you have tonight is to deny his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| If you're inclined to give any weight at all to amending the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| you must initiate that with a request that will go back to MPC for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:50| Plan amendments can be initiated by the Planning Commission, and in this case they chose not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| or they can be initiated by the legislative body, which in this case is you all, County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| That would go back to MPC and both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| That would be considered, and the recommendation would then come back to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and you could choose to affirm that recommendation if it happens to be in approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| or you can ignore that recommendation and approve the sector plan amendment and then approve his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:25| So this is one of those situations where he could not appeal the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| because MPC chose not to move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| So I'll be glad to proceed, but just kind of keep that in mind in terms of the procedural issue here involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:44| The zoning case, as I mentioned, is at the intersection of North Shore Drive and Shadow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| Previously, the Planning Commission had approved a large rezoning to the northeast of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| on another quadrant of the Shadow Road-North Shore Drive intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| That property included approximately 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| That property is under the process now being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| We have had one internal individual plan approved in addition to an overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| We had one plan approved for a convenience market at that intersection within that NC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| At the time that MPC staff and the Commission considered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| it appeared that that had a lot of merit by virtue of the fact that, first of all, this is a crossroads intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| There was a lot of interest in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| We felt like that because of the inadequacy of this level of commercial services in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| that it was appropriate to think about locating those kinds of low-intense, low-impact commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:58| that could serve the immediate neighborhoods in the immediately surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| This does a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| It cuts down on automobile traffic, having to go long distances to get a small amount of commercial goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| It also can reduce traffic if you have to go to an office use that might be low-impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| or other kind of uses that, again, have a neighborhood orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| That site was large enough where you could do some detailed site planning and appropriate site planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| Also, you could look at buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| And at some point in time, you could look at possibly beginning to make some connections to the surrounding residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| With regard to this particular case, you have one acre of land that is adjacent to a developed residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:57| This particular case was the case of some interest some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| I believe it was denied by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| Let me double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Yes, MPC denied a commercial plan designation zoning in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| And similar requests were withdrawn in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| And in both cases, as I recall, there was heavy opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| At that time, we might have looked at using the CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| But in hindsight, after this request on the north side was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| we felt like that that was the appropriate location for neighborhood commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| The site that you have in question is essentially too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| We don't think that you can incorporate the design criteria in the CN zone that would make sense with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| Access would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| And the fact that it has such a close proximity to an existing residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| without the benefit of providing that buffering that could be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| we felt like that in hindsight, again, in taking another look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| the CN zone would not be appropriate for the property you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| nor would any commercial zoning that would generate the kinds of uses and traffic that this site would encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:24| So the Planning Commission took a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| There was some leftover opposition to this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| from the previous neighborhood commercial request that was on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| So with all that information in mind, the Planning Commission voted to deny this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| which was based in part on the denial of the sector plan amendment to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:53| Will you finish, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you very much, colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| I urge you to look at pages 2240 to 2247 of our very long packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| It's at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| I want you to take note of what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| Our very willing-to-help business and developers, MPC, said no to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| The staff said no to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| And they gave good reasons, reasons associated with traffic and related problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| A group formed in this community, they even have a website, protectchotto.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| and they have 400 signatures against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| There has already been some lenience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| But here we're asking for a sector plan when the staff wrote as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| This site is in the development stages with only a convenience store approved and to be developed at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| Establishment of additional neighborhood commercial uses is not necessary at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| Additionally, this site is small, unlocated, directly adjacent to an existing subdivision and residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| The opportunities for appropriate buffering are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| The full MPC wrote the subject property is small, too small to adequately meet the CN development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| and establish appropriate buffering to the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Access may be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| And they mentioned traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| This is a clear case where we shouldn't be making a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| because the staff has done a very thorough review and the MPC has done a very thorough review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| And both have told us that the neighborhood group was right on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| The 400-plus people who signed a petition on this one know that this one's a traffic mess and an unnecessary change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| The change that was already made has left an area that is not filling up rapidly at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| We don't need any more NC there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| And we don't need any more NC changes that create a traffic hazard for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| I realize another group is here with another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| But let me speak on behalf of those 400 people who signed that petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| If there's ever a time to uphold the MPC and deny a zoning appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| 2240 to 2247, lay it out clearly and distinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| And I hope as we go into the discussion you'll skim them or read them and realize that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:31| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| None of the 420 has or anybody has contacted me in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| So I'm not saying they've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| Just no one has bothered to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| Wayne, could you, I guess I feel like we ought to give your side at least an opportunity to present your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6231)|
| 1:44:05| So if you'd like to go ahead and then I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| My name is Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| I'm here on behalf of the appellant, the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| I'm at 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| I'm their attorney and contrary to what Commissioner Harmon is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| this legislative body has already said that NC commercial zoning is appropriate for this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| This one acre lot sits on the other side of Choteau Road at the crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| This is the last of the four lots on the corner of the intersection of Choteau Road and North Shore that will or could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:47| And it is an out parcel from the neighboring subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| It is a one acre piece of property that was left out of the Buffett Mill subdivision because it sits on the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6293)|
| 1:45:03| So they carved it out for purposes of anything other than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| And back in 1990, as Mr. Johnson was saying, and again in 1994, there was application for commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:17| but that was before the NC zone existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| And now we're here because this body has said this intersection is appropriate for NC zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| and we're asking that our one acre lot be also designated appropriate because it sits at the same intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:34| Traffic concerns should not be of paramount importance because everybody is slowing down to go through the intersection anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:42| And the restraints and the constraints that this body put on the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:49| which if you recall, back in January, this body said, yes, NC zoning is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| and yes, we would approve along with MPC a sector plan change and a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:03| In this case, you have to say, okay, NC is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| but we're going to send it back to MPC for further consideration on the plan amendment because you can't do that the way the new statute is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:17| So for all the reasons that this body said it is an appropriate intersection for NC development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| we're asking for the same treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| My client only wants to put one building on it, a 5,000 square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| We do want to put appropriate buffering between this commercial enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| which has to be in concert with the neighborhood commercial zone, and the neighboring properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| by putting layers of evergreens enough to satisfy the buffering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| Also, the NC zone is appropriate because you have to follow the mandates of MPC's zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| That means you have to go on a use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| There's architectural concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| You have to build your building that's appropriate to the architecture and the aesthetics of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| and you have to keep your commercial enterprise within the mandates of the NC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| things like barbershops and daycare centers, and that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| So there's not really any difference between this property and the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| which this commission has already approved, except size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| And we can take care of the size by putting a small building on it with enough parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| and that's all we want to do, and put an appropriate NC, a neighborhood commercial, enterprise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:41| So I'll answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| So, Mr. Kline, your client is willing to put up some evergreens or some type of buffering between, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6464)|
| 1:47:54| the back and side of this building and the backs of those homeowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Three layers, if necessary, between the back of this lot and the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| And it's only on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| It doesn't need it on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| And as far as access, would you be accessing North Shore or Choteau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Choteau only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Choteau only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| And there would be sufficient distance between the access for egress and ingress on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| and the entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| Just stay right there, but I have a question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| Back in January, and although I recused myself of this, I paid attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| one of the arguments, and Commissioner Harmon just brought this up about it being too small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:49| is that the opponents of the Huber property argued that 15 acres was too large for the NC designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:59| So what is the appropriate size parcel for the NC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| Is it somewhere between 1 and 15, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| There is no magical amount of area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| but the larger track certainly allowed Mr. Huber to preserve the buffering to the stream that existed on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:29| to provide larger than minimal setbacks from the perimeter of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| and allowed him some flexibility in design to shield the parking from view from North Shore Drive and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6577)|
| 1:49:47| So the larger site has allowed some flexibility in the design that will be beneficial in our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:54| But if I recall, those people that opposed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| I think they brought forth the MPC's information of how large an NC zone should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:08| and this was quite a bit larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| The 15 acres was substantially larger than what they were saying that you all recommended for the NC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:23| So I guess I'm still a little confused as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| I mean, are we talking it should only be about five, six acres big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| unless there's circumstances that allow for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| or I'm just getting a little bit of a conflict here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| One's too big, one's too small, but somewhere it's just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| It depends on the site, the location of the site, the topography of the site, the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| All of those things play a factor in the decisions that this body has to make when rezoning property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| The other concern with the Huber property, and I have with this one here, is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| And where are we on North Shore being fixed as far as the hump that was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:19| That was a big part of the discussion, and the Hubers were supposed to take care of the hump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:26| that's right there, right just east of this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| so that you have better sight when you're trying to either approach that intersection from either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| Right now it's a little bit of a hazard because of people heading westbound on North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| when they come over that hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| They can't tell if someone's pulling out in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Likewise, if you're on Choteau pulling out onto North Shore, you can't see an approaching vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| Where are we on that being fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| Has engineering, and I don't know if there's anybody here from engineering that can answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| where are we on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| Because I'm not willing to approve anything at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| until the road has been fixed as far as that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:16| Mr. Kline, do you know where we are on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I drove out there yesterday, and it hasn't changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| but the hump is back where the Huber property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Our property is at the intersection after you turn onto Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| It's at the western side of that intersection, the southwestern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Well, I guess my problem, though, is that we would be adding more traffic to that intersection possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:45| coming on, I guess, south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| It's in the southwest corner, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| So those that are going to be trying to turn off, they'd be heading north on Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| trying to turn either east or west on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| and not being able to see traffic coming from the east, heading westbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| So that needs to be resolved because hopefully if you have a successful business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| then you've got more traffic trying to turn onto North Shore from that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| Commissioner, as I see the intersection and that hump, that is west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| And yes, you've got a hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| I'm sorry, it's east of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| Yes, you've got a hump there, but it's not going to impact the site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| for this intersection corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| And neighborhood commercial traffic takes traffic from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| You're not going to bring people from East Knox County to a barber shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| that's at the corner of Choteau and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| But the goal would still be to pull some traffic off of North Shore, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| Well, the goal would be to have a successful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| And then it would draw from all four directions, east, south, north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| Yes, I mean, let's talk practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| I wouldn't deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| So all I'm asking is that my concern, before I found out I ended up having a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| because I had a relative working on that that I didn't know until the night of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| my main concern was that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| Right now all we have is a flashing yellow light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| which is not adequate for as dangerous of an intersection that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| I would like to see there be something done to that intersection before we approve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| And I think that's what a lot of commissioners that night were concerned with as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| that that intersection be improved before we start putting commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| I don't have so much a problem with the right restrictions to approve something down this line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:57| provided that the intersection has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| And I guess that you're being held hostage in my mind until that hump has been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| I think this commission also said we want that as part of the Huber deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| And Huber said that as part of their development they would take the hump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| or participate in a plan to take the hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| And we would not be adverse to you saying, well, CN is appropriate zone for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| and we'll change the plan, but you can't develop CN there until that hump is taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| That's sort of where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| I'm just asking where are we in getting that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| And I guess engineering is not here to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| But the problem as I see it is that this is the last available use for this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| And to hold it hostage to something that really is part and parcel to another development would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| It would be appropriate to say you can't make it more or less safe, and that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| But we're here to talk about a zoning and plan amendment in concert with a neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| and what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| And as I say in my letter to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| we would be willing to submit to all the conditions this body placed on the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| including what you're talking about, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| I just had a question really for the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| I know that they would have to come back if we went through this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| and changed the sector plan and the neighborhood commercial zoning was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| But when you go back and look at a use on review for a lot this size, can you really manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| or can you put together a concept plan, I guess you would call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| that would suit all the needs and desires of a neighborhood commercial with the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| the size of a parking lot, the size of a, you know, taking into consideration a 5,000-square-foot building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:10| I'm glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| This particular zone for most of the uses, a use on review is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| I thought I saw that in the letter, that whether that would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| There are some uses that would require a use on review and a review of a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| but not for most of the uses that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| Well, let me ask you this question for the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| I beg to differ with you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| We're willing to submit to a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| and almost every use that we want to put to this building is required to have a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:51| And I'm sorry, Dr. Briggs, I interrupted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| But I guess, as Will, again, directing this at the NPC, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| Will, the type of business that they're planning, you know, under a neighborhood commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| can that be done with what the intention is of that zoning designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| To me, an acre lot is pretty small to run a business, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| especially if you try to do the things that's required by a neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:34| I can respond while they're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| We've looked at it, and we think we can do either a 5,000 or a little bit smaller building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| and meet all the requirements, including the setbacks and the buffering requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| without damaging the aesthetics of the neighborhood and violating the purpose of the NC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:56| You know, I guess, and I'm just going to speak here before this comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| I know there's other people have questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| But, you know, we approved that other, you know, the other lot at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| and that was with NPC concurrence because there were really many restrictions put on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| where each part of the plan, as it was put together, had to come back for NPC review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| There was a lot, to say the least, of neighborhood resistance to that, but it passed the commission unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:30| I know that one of the arguments that the neighborhoods made out there was that this would just open the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| for extensive commercial development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| I'm still listening to get more information on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| but I do have some concerns that before we approved this because NPC said it was okay to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| and the way it was brought forth, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| I think that after it's all said and done that the residents out there would, I think they'll like what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| I do have more concerns, though, when the NPC says, you know, this may not be a good idea out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:11| you know, particularly where there is some resident opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| Yeah, this particular zone for uses that are permitted, and that uses, that list is fairly lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| those uses, a site plan has to be prepared, but it's reviewed by the Department of Code Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| So most of the uses under the zone are commercial in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| There's some office uses, other kinds of uses that are permitted as a neighborhood commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| The application listed commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| That's what the staff report said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Now, the list of uses that would require a site plan, child daycare centers, adult daycare centers, restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| fueling stations with or without convenience stores, any permitted use listed above, outdoor storage of materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| and cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| But my understanding is that use on review occurs when someone wants to have a project that's not on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| but may be appropriate, but it needs to be reviewed before it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| Is that generally correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| One of the conditions that was approved with the Huber rezoning was that they do submit a use on review development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:29| for all development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| And with regard to the size, one of the benefits of having a larger size was that they could plan the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:42| so that there was shared parking located internal to the site so that they were bringing buildings up close to the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| and also had adequate space and landscaping buffers to adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| With the smaller site, that becomes more problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| You'll see the site plan that's been attached as part of the rezoning request puts the building to the rear of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| adjacent to the established subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| What we wanted to do was just give the MPC an outline of where we might put a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| What we wanted to do, we didn't want to put two or three buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| The conditions that you placed on the Huber property were three, uses limited to permitted uses in the CN zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| all outdoor site lighting must meet the strict cutoff luminaire standards of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| and three, as you're discussing, Commissioner, the entire development shall be subject to a unified architectural plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| that meets the intent of Knox County's general plan for a village-like appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| consistent with the development policy 9.9 of the Knox County 2032 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| We are willing to submit to that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| And I must say, again, we don't have anything else to do with this property because of what it is and its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:15| You're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| You know, we spent quite a bit of time on this back in January on the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| and I'm not sure that we've even covered all of the wherefores and why causes that we brought up at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| But even though that is a 15-acre, almost 15-acre site, from what I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:42| only a little over half of that is going to be developable because of stream and forest constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:50| This is one of the reasons why I think that it was passed as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| Granted, that is seemingly a large parcel for neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| but as I say, when you look at the usable part that they're going to wind up with, it's a lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:09| At that time, we also talked about this lot that you're bringing up here across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| and the fact that it would cause additional problems if that corner was also commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| and that's one of the reasons why that I did, and I think maybe some others voted for the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| because we were sure that that would not be happening on the other corner over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| And now we're coming back to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| So that is a dangerous intersection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| I'm familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Even though I live on the south side, I know very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| I've been down there several times and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| But I think that with the center that's been approved there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:55| that is going to be big enough to take care of any neighborhood small commercial businesses that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7495)|
| 2:05:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| My first question would be, is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| I don't know which side I'm putting tally marks under yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| There's not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| That might be something that we might like to move along to so I can sort of keep up with where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| The second thing is that this intersection, I know we're talking about the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| and we're trying to do it irrespective of the hump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| but when I read the information that's contained on page 2244,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| this intersection is the fifth most dangerous in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| and it's six times more dangerous than the state average for intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| And that has nothing to do with the hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| I guess you're trying to tell me there a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| And then the last thing is that I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part2?start=7563)|
