| 0:00:59| Clerk, would you go ahead and read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| Discussion and possible action regarding the Knox County Commission Committee and board appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=65)|
| 0:01:16| I'm going to turn this over to our law director, the locket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| I requested that I be able to give this presentation from here so I could see each one of you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| respond to questions at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| Let me first point out the mission statement of the Knox County Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| I drafted this before taking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| On the first day, I handed it out to my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| It appears on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| I would like to draw your attention to the second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| And I'll read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| It says, and it being the duty of the law director to execute and administer all of the legal affairs of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| and to advise and counsel the various officers thereof, it shall be the policy of the law director's office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| truthfully and completely proclaim the law to all county officials, regardless of personal considerations or untoward consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=136)|
| 0:02:31| The statute at issue that was the subject of my memo to the commissioners regarding the issue of serving on boards or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=151)|
| 0:02:42| committees over which this commission has the appointing power is Tennessee Code Annotated Section 5-5-111,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=162)|
| 0:02:52| and the pertinent subsection is subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| If you look at the language, it's clear, and I have highlighted, underlined the appropriate provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=178)|
| 0:03:09| And it reads, if a member of the county legislative body is subsequently appointed to the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| position in this case being one over which this body has appointive power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| the member shall immediately resign from the county legislative body upon accepting the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=205)|
| 0:03:38| This provision was signed into law by the governor in May of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| In connection with performing research on the issue of membership on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=228)|
| 0:03:59| we encountered this statute and did additional research and found the attorney general opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| which is numbered 08-144.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| The attorney general has interpreted this statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| and the attorney general's advisory opinion was attached to the memo that was circulated to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| As you can see, the attorney general says, interpreting that statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| we think a court would conclude that a county commissioner must resign once appointed to an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| over which the commission has appointive authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| And then the attorney general came up with an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| an exception that I'll stress to you is not contained in the statute itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| but it is one that the attorney general is giving an opinion to the effect that if there is a separate statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=296)|
| 0:05:08| that is in conflict, irreconcilable conflict, with the statute that we just went over a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| and that statute requires that commissioners serve on the body over which it has appointive power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=317)|
| 0:05:28| that commissioners could serve or members of the county legislative body could serve on both the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=328)|
| 0:05:37| and that separate board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Keep in mind, and I tried to make clear in my memo, that that is an advisory opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| It's not contained in the statute itself, and it does not have force of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| The next page deals with the issue of irreconcilable differences, as set forth in the attorney general opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=356)|
| 0:06:07| That last sentence, I think, is the key one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Whether the requirement of resignation under the new statute applies to other county offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| over which the county commission has the power of appointment would depend on the particular statute creating the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=381)|
| 0:06:30| For example, the statute creating the Beer Board or the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| Dealing with the issue of legislative intent, what did the legislature mean when they enacted this statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=398)|
| 0:06:49| And we'll talk about that at some length, and I'll be happy to answer questions at the end of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=409)|
| 0:07:00| But as a resource, we look at different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| In the first instance, as lawyers in the law director's office, when we're trying to glean the intent of the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=429)|
| 0:07:19| you look at the language of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| If the language of the statute is clear, there's really no need to look further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| But because we want to give this body as good legal advice as possible, we do go to other sources, the resources that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=452)|
| 0:07:44| One of which is an advisory opinion, and it was already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| We didn't ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| It was already out there interpreting the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| And as you can see, the attorney general agrees with our interpretation of the language of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| Or vice versa, however you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| The attorney general agrees with our interpretation of the language of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| Or vice versa, however you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| The attorney general issued this opinion before we looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| But it says, by its terms, and it's referring to that subsection C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| By its terms, therefore, this provision applies to any position the county legislative body is authorized to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=503)|
| 0:08:43| Both the attorney general and the county technical advisory service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| There's been some discussion, and there was an article in the newspaper about a field directive sent by one of the CTAS attorneys out to its folks in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=528)|
| 0:09:02| It might interest you to know that CTAS, which is an excellent organization that does a great job for counties just like MTAS across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| but its resources are not monumental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| It has four attorneys to cover the entire state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| It has a staff of 31 to cover the entire state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| But it mentioned, as does the attorney general opinion, this decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court, which is still good law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=564)|
| 0:09:34| It was a 1952 decision, but it addressed public policy in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| And we have shepherdized the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| It is still the law in the state of Tennessee, and it's still relied on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| As you can see, if you read the attorney general's opinion, and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| It is contrary to public policy to permit an appointing body to appoint one of its own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| Now that public policy, and since this is a court decision, it gives way if there's a specific statute that will allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=606)|
| 0:10:20| that requires that an appointing body appoint its own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| But the general public policy is to the contrary, as you can see from this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| A moment ago, I mentioned to you in deriving the intent of a statute, where do you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=633)|
| 0:10:47| You start with the language of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| This is what the Tennessee Supreme Court says you do in the first instance in attempting to interpret a statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=651)|
| 0:11:03| And this is what the court does when it reads a statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| It presumes that the legislature says in a statute what it means, and means in a statute what it says there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=668)|
| 0:11:19| So if the language of the statute, the plain meaning of the words employed, is clear and unambiguous, then you look no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=679)|
| 0:11:30| You don't look to what happened on the floor of the House or the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| You don't look at anything other than the language of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| If the language of the statute is ambiguous, then you can go beyond and look at other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| I respectfully submit to you that the statute in question is unambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| You can read it and see what it says and what it addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| If, however, and the argument can always be made, and it's made by those who would prefer to look at legislative intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=720)|
| 0:12:15| If, however, one assumed for the sake of argument that there was ambiguity in this statute, then you can look behind the language and go to legislative intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=735)|
| 0:12:31| Senator Tim Burchett was a sponsor of this legislation in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| And he has publicly stated that he felt that banning commissioners from serving on boards with members appointed by county commission was part of the intent of the legislation that he proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=760)|
| 0:13:02| I mentioned CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| When this issue first came up and my office was requested to begin examining membership on the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=791)|
| 0:13:22| and whether it was required that members of this body serve or not, and exactly what the law was, we began our research and that's when we found this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=802)|
| 0:13:35| And that's when we found the Attorney General Advisory Opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| But again, in an effort to glean from as many sources as possible, I asked my Chief Deputy, Mr. Jarrett, to contact CTAS and see what experience they had with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=819)|
| 0:13:55| And here is the email traffic between my office and CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=835)|
| 0:14:06| An attorney named Jeffrey Michael Metzger on January 28th sent this email to my office in which Mr. Metzger said that we, meaning CTAS, have always opined that members of the county legislative body cannot be appointed by the county legislative body to boards unless there is a specific law authorizing such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=846)|
| 0:14:33| Otherwise, such appointment would contravene public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Now that's relying on the case that I mentioned to you a moment ago, the 1952 Supreme Court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| Mr. Metzger then went on to reference the statute in question and the Attorney General's interpretation of it and talks about the Attorney General's exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=883)|
| 0:14:59| Once the memo that my office sent to the lady and gentleman of the commission informing them of the results of our research, once the recommendations that we made became public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=899)|
| 0:15:29| we were contacted by various counties across the state requesting copies of our research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=929)|
| 0:15:42| And as we all know, there's been a lot written about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Other counties have made various recommendations and there is now a bill in the legislature proposed by members of the Blount County Legislative Delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=947)|
| 0:16:18| That addresses this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| And you see that proposed legislation on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| The pivotal part of this legislation, proposed legislation, I think for our purposes and that I ask you to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=987)|
| 0:16:54| is in the fourth line from the top, beginning with the word if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1014)|
| 0:17:05| If such member could have legally accepted such appointment prior to May 6, 2008, without resigning from the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1025)|
| 0:17:17| That begs the question of the effect of the State v. Thompson decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1037)|
| 0:17:29| That decision says that it's contrary to public policy in the state of Tennessee for members of a legislative body who have the power of appointment to appoint its own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1049)|
| 0:17:47| Unless there is a, and I believe what that means is that unless there is a specific statute that requires otherwise, just like the Attorney General says, that it violates the law to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1067)|
| 0:18:06| There is no question that it violates the Tennessee Code section as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1086)|
| 0:18:18| Now this proposed legislation also in the last sentence says that, and the intent there obviously is to validate any action taken by any board or committee since May 6, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1098)|
| 0:18:40| And that is winding its way through the legislature and we'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| I'd like to address three main areas of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| I think they're the ones that have the biggest impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| First, let's talk about the Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| The state statute that deals with beer boards and empowers the creation of beer boards at the local level in terms of membership and what it says about membership is Tennessee Code annotated section 57-5-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1152)|
| 0:19:33| It says that those who request an application, file an application for a permit, file with either, number one, the county legislative body or a committee appointed by the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1173)|
| 0:19:55| So, either the entire county commission can sit as a beer board or county commission can appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1195)|
| 0:20:11| The statute says nothing about the committee being comprised of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| Therefore, the statute does not require that the committee be comprised of county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| Therefore, if you decide to appoint a committee as beer board in order to comply with state law, you cannot appoint your own members to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1229)|
| 0:20:46| If it's the will of this body that commission serve as beer board, then you can, but it has to be the entire legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1246)|
| 0:21:07| The Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| The only thing that the state statute says regarding BZA is that in charter counties, you have three, five, or nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1272)|
| 0:21:27| It does not require that commissioners serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| It gives county legislative bodies the power of appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| Therefore, under the terms of the statute that we've been talking about here today, under the terms of the Supreme Court decision, you cannot appoint your own members to the BZA without violating that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1300)|
| 0:22:03| The same thing with the Vacant Property Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1323)|
| 0:22:17| Depending on the will of this body, my office has prepared proposed resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1337)|
| 0:22:35| I think you can act by resolution in this regard on an interim basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| The procedure that we put out for your consideration is that you can, as regards beer board, you can by resolution appoint the entire commission as the beer board, or you can by resolution appoint a citizen committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1362)|
| 0:23:09| Either one of those options is legal and would comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| With BZA, we have a resolution for your consideration to appoint a citizen committee with appointees to serve the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1396)|
| 0:23:40| To appoint a citizen committee with appointees to serve the remainder of unexpired terms, and the members would be designated to occupy seats one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1420)|
| 0:23:58| The Vacant Property Review Commission, per Knox County Code, is to consist of nine appointments made by the mayor, subject to approval by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1438)|
| 0:24:24| And I'm open for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Mr. Chairman, with delight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| Well, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| First, I want to thank you for the thoroughness of your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| During your presentation, I got on and I shepherdized the very case you cited, State v. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| I found 33 citations, two by the Supreme Court and six by the Court of Appeals, and all seemed to go in the direction you've indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Does our status as a charter county in any way affect or modify or potentially affect or modify what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1499)|
| 0:25:09| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| The other thing is, you said internal committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Let me just run through some of these and make sure that we're on the same page about what are internal committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Cable committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Would that be an internal committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I don't believe that it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| It would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| So we should appoint citizen or do something else on cable committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| I believe that that's the case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| The ad hoc committee we've created to examine county vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Would that be OK to be an internal committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| The insolvency committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| You may not be aware we had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| I didn't know that we had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I'm totally unaware of the insolvency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| No, we had one until I found out I was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| It's actually not in the there is, I believe, an appointments notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| I'm not sure the insolvency committee is in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| If that's an internal committee like finance or intergovernmental, it would not be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| And so it would not be an internal committee, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Better check on insolvency committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| And audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| The audit committee is most definitely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| It is affected in such a way that it's not an internal committee or is an internal committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| It is not an internal committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| So of the ones I've mentioned, cable and audit, we would have to find a new way of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| But vehicle and probably insolvency, we can continue as internal committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you for those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| So, Bill, there's more than three committees, the beer board, BVA and vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| So there's other committees also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| These are the ones that I think come up the most and have the most impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| And I wanted to address those today so that whatever action you might deem prudent could be discussed and taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1620)|
| 0:27:13| because the beer board and the BVA are scheduled to meet at their regular times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| And that could possibly take place depending on what action this body deems best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| Or it may be that those have to be delayed a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| It just depends on the will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| I would have liked to have dealt with all of it at one time, get everything out on the table and deal with it and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Lockett, on the BVA board there, we had three citizens on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I don't know if all of them resigned or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| One has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Well, would the other two still be on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| In other words, we sent letters out to them telling them they need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| You're saying that's not true now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I didn't send letters to them telling them they had to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| I'm sorry then I misunderstood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Some of them got a letter that they should resign because Mr. Daniels came up here, I think, and talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| I think Mr. Daniels came up here to address the issue that had been raised because it was being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| But my office has sent no communication to anyone other than sitting commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| But those two that are still on there could still serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| We would have to point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| We could possibly, from your understanding, appoint one more on there since it's three, five, or nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Although we also have an ordinance that addresses BVA that speaks in terms of having nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| So I would recommend that whatever action you take, that there has to be nine members on it to comply with our ordinance as well as state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1743)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Well, what I was getting to, I was thinking, you know, BVA, the agenda is already set for this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| that if possibly we could get one of these commissioners, I'm going to say Ms. Davis or Refreeze or somebody that's familiar with the way things work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1760)|
| 0:29:31| appoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| That could get us through until we could see what the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| But you're saying with the ordinance that wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I would not recommend that you attempt to operate the Board of Zoning Appeals with only three members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| One of these resolutions that you passed out that we would appoint citizens to the beer board, you have only seven Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1794)|
| 0:30:06| but there's been nine commissioners on beer board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Could we not have nine citizens on beer board instead of seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Is there a reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| It's a Scrivener's error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| There should be nine instead of seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Yes, Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Getting back, is there a listing of all these committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| I mean, we've got a lot of different committees and task force like Judicial Committee, the Tenure Homeless Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| What about these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Are these affected by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| The Judicial Committee would not be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| It is an internal committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| We're in the process of addressing all of these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Some do not meet on a regular basis, and the origin of the committee is the important aspect for us to ascertain in the first instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1854)|
| 0:31:09| is whether a particular committee over which this body has appointed power, whether the genesis of that is state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| or whether it's an ad hoc committee created locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And because of the sheer volume of those committees and the rapidity with which this issue has arisen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1882)|
| 0:31:33| we simply have not been able to perform the research to find out on every one of them whether they exist by virtue of state law or local ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1893)|
| 0:31:49| or simply are internal committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| But we are in the process of doing that, and I anticipate having that complete by the full commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| and I will communicate that information to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Could we pass one of these on an emergency basis today so that, for instance, the Bureau Board could continue its operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1929)|
| 0:32:19| It wouldn't require that it be done on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| If you do it by resolution, it would require a two-thirds vote to place it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| and I think you could either do that today or you could do it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Our agenda today says discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| Would that not already place a resolution to that effect on the agenda for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Well, I don't know that it would require a two-thirds since we said or possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| So someone could make a motion, and I think it's already on the agenda as long as it pertains to what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| I'd like to make that motion then that we adopt the resolution that the Knox County Bureau Board shall consist of the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Does anyone have a question on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Seeing none, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Everybody's lights are on from previous, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| I've heard from a lot of constituents since this came about who approve of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| and are very excited that there are more opportunities now for citizens to be directly involved in their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| And I think that we need to think long and hard before we decide that we're just going to all be the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| As much as I have enjoyed being on beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| I know that appointing citizens to these committees gives more people an opportunity to serve their communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| and I think that's something that's very important and that we should look at very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| For instance, we had in the 7th District seven or eight people who wanted to fill that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| We could only appoint one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| This gives us more outlets for letting people serve their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| And like I said, I enjoy being on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| but I also am very much in favor of giving our citizens opportunities to serve their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| But a citizen's board's actions are still going to have to be approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| Is that true, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Same thing with the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Are there any other questions to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Actually, the question that Commissioner Brown just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| that of what happens when the citizen's body rules on something, which I personally like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| and then that is not reviewed by the elected persons, us, to include the beer board and the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| And I don't know what other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| The BZA and the beer board are quasi-judicial bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| And when they make a decision, if one of the parties to that decision does not like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| their resort at that point is directly to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| How does that come back to County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Well, I would suggest at some point, sooner rather than later, we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Now, we may or may not want to change it, but I think we at least need to bring the question up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| And I don't know if it can be redirected to us for appeals prior to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| How is that established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I mean, what makes it not reviewable by us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Well, now, does that just apply to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Well, because that's not the way the other governing body in this city works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| It's the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I'm not sure what you mean when you say the other governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Well, I knew you were talking about the city, but the BZA is a creature of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| And it adheres, obviously, by its very title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| It is the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| So matters that come to the BZA have already been decided in one forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| They're appealed to BZA for a final administrative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| And in order to appeal that administrative decision, you go to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| Same thing with the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| But that initial forum may not be this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| It may be MPC, which is also appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Well, then, Commissioner Brown, do you intend for this to be temporary until we can deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| and perhaps consider putting citizens on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| No, I intend for it to be permanent until it's revoked by another ordinance that would do that to supersede it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Any more questions on Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I have questions on some other things, but I want to address the Beer Board in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| Bill, I asked the County Commission Office to send me a copy of our beer ordinance as it stands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| And unless it has been changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| it says the County Beer Board shall be consisted of seven members of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| selected by the commission, et cetera, et cetera, during committee reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I want to go back to your comment before that our charter is not applicable here, but we have to go by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| Could you give me a little bit more information on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| as to why, if we have passed this, that this is not valid, that we have to go now by state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| The interpretation by the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| and I think the language of this statute that we're talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| the one that was signed into law by the Governor in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| refers to and it specifically uses the word statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| And it says the statute that creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| And we've done some research trying to determine whether or not that means a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2331)|
| 0:39:03| passed by the General Assembly or a local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| And I'll be very forthright and tell you there's not a definitive answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| as to whether or not the conflict that's referred to in the Attorney General's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| the irreconcilable conflict, whether it can be created only in a statute passed by the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2361)|
| 0:39:31| or it can also be created locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| So the risk that you take if you pass or rely on a local ordinance as creating a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2376)|
| 0:39:50| is that there is no exception in the statute itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| You would be relying on an advisory opinion from the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| Now as much respect as I have for the Attorney General and the staff and the research that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| Knox County probably more than any other local government in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| knows the danger in relying on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| We passed term limits in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| The Attorney General in an advisory opinion said that term limits were not constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2427)|
| 0:40:39| And so for years and years we proceeded as if the term limits that were passed by the voters didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2439)|
| 0:40:49| And then the Supreme Court in the Bailey decision out of Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| threw the Attorney General's advisory opinion aside and said the Attorney General's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| Term limits are constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| So that's just one example of the risk of relying on an advisory opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| Again, I'm trying to in the capacity of law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| and let me be as forthright as I can and tell you that these are uncharted waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| and I'm trying to steer us through them without becoming involved in litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| and to reduce the risk that this body will take an action that can later be challenged in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2493)|
| 0:41:45| That's why I keep defaulting to what I call the safest course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| The safest course of action is appointment of citizens because that way there is no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2512)|
| 0:42:04| Now on beer board there is also no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| If this body wants to serve as beer board as a body, there's no question that state law authorizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| So that creates that irreconcilable conflict mentioned by the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| Again, I've got some other questions about other things, but to relate to this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| I'm in favor of having the legislative body serve as the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| And again, I agree that that's the safest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I know that there are different interpretations from whether you're in O'Brien County or Weakley County, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| but you're our guy and so we're listening to your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| And the reason I say that, as you mentioned, this is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| The beer board can impose fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| The beer board can padlock a person's beer sales and just say you can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| They can deny licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| And I believe that we, the buck has to stop with us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| And, yes, there is court action that could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| and I believe that we're the body that would best be able to defend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| And I just believe that we need to make the decisions about the livelihoods of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| I'm not saying a citizen body couldn't do that and would be very capable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| but I'm saying when you look at the whole legal realm of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I'm in favor of this body having the buck stop with us since we do have to do those licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| we do impose fines, and we do affect a person's livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| So I'll be voting in favor of Mr. Brown's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| And state law, there's no question, does authorize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| And I'd also like to thank the law department for their really good work in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| and keeping us out of harm's way as best we can in these uncharted waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| I'm going to have to agree with Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| While I, you know, strongly endorse citizen committees where appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| I think the Bear Board is not an appropriate place for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| because ultimately if this thing, if there is a mechanism where it goes to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| and then we create something where we're the final review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| then we're just creating another step that's really not necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| that we're ultimately saying yay or nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| If we don't do that, we're talking about probably significant legal fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| and who will be responsible if a citizen has his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| or business is padlocked and he takes it to chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Would that be your department representing us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| That committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| So I think we'll just end up getting ourselves into a tailspin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| And the final reason is ultimately, you know, that citizen committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| they'll be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| We hope we're going to choose good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| But ultimately, you know, the ballot box is our ultimate, you know, responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| And if we're doing something on this Bear Board that people don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| that they have a means and a mechanism to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So that's why I'll be voting in favor of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I have to agree with Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Citizen participation is a very, very important item that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| But you also have to balance that with the responsibilities of being an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| and the consequences that these committees and boards have on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| We have been elected by the people to be their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| And we have a fiduciary responsibility to this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| And we were elected to make these tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| And I just think that the gravity that the Bear Board has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| I think that is something that we, as being the elected officials, need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| There are other boards and committees that I think would be best served by citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| but I think the Bear Board is best served by the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Is the city council, does it serve as the city's Bear Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Well, that does give some precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| And you all are making some very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I just want to make sure that we do, wherever possible, make it both possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| and important for our citizens to serve when and where they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| And I really enjoy being on Bear Board, but it's not, I would consider BZA to be a trickier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| more likely to result in legal action than Bear Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Bear Board is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I'm not as much concerned about what we do with Bear Board as I am with what we end up doing with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| I think that's going to be the tricky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I hope when we make appointments, because clearly there will be some new citizen involvement in committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| that we remember the people who applied for various openings and positions before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| some of whom we like but just didn't have room for, as was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| I would also ask, I thought of a couple, at least one other committee, the Greens Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| We recently had to make some appointments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Is that internal or is that another one we're going to have to make some changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| I need to go back and look at the recent action that was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| which was when we reorganized and the county took over management of the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| I think I have to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Point of order, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| We have a motion on the floor, and this does not relate to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| It doesn't relate to Bear Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| That's correct, and I'll hold that question for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| I've got a speech planned, too, and I'm waiting for later on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| All in favor of Commissioner Brown's motion that all 19 commissioners on the Bear Board say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| I guess we need to deal with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| To set your recommendation, let me get it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| You're going to look at all the committees and see if it's internal or it's something that we need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Yeah, Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| Could we, through an ordinance, require the entire commission to serve on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| creating that irreconcilable conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| That's the unknown, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Whether or not a local ordinance does create the irreconcilable conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| and the reason I say it's unknown is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| Number one, the exception to the statute created by the Attorney General uses the word statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| and it talks in terms of the statute that creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Now, state law authorizes BZA, and it says that you must have a Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=2999)|
| 0:50:14| So it begs the question whether or not the irreconcilable difference has to be in the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| that would require county commissioners to serve on BZA or whether it can be created at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3022)|
| 0:50:32| Well, here's my issue, and here's why I believe that we need to do, that commissioners need to be serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3032)|
| 0:50:44| Members of this commission are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| We all go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| We run campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| We run campaigns in different districts, and then we're chosen by the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Some of us have very different opinions on land use issues that may come before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| Myself, I often have a different opinion from Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| I was chosen from a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Point of order, Dr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Dr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Don't get us confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| We were chosen by districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| We were elected by districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| We ran campaigns, and part of the reason why we were elected were our views on certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| Now, to go to a citizen board where folks are not elected by the citizen, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| while it looks like we're putting the citizen in it by appointing someone, we're actually taking the citizen out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3096)|
| 0:51:46| We're turning this into a political appointment, you know, that's not as binding as an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| I mean, of course the citizens elected me, and I would have some say in who accepts a BZA appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| but it's not the same as their direct representative that they voted for serving on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| Now, other counties agree with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| There's already a move afoot within the state legislature to correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| They say regardless of what Senator Burchett says, they say that when they voted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| it was certainly not their intent to limit commissioners from serving on this, and there's a move to repair this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| And that's why I think the temporary measure that we should take is to let this entire commission serve as BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| because I believe we do have a legal leg to stand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| It's a very legitimate challenge, and by the time this makes it to the courts, and, folks, this is Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| as long as the sun rises, Herb Monsier is going to file lawsuits against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| That's just a fact of life around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| But we do have a legal defense to that action, and by the time this gets through court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| it will be a mute point because the state legislature will very likely have repaired this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| This board, the Board of Zoning Appeals, affects folks' lives just as profoundly as the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| It affects their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| It affects their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| It decides whether they can exercise their right to the pursuit of happiness to put a swimming pool in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3202)|
| 0:53:31| It's a very important task that the BZA has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| and I believe that that task should be handled by elected officials like us, elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| And that's why I want to propose, and I'm making this as a motion, and I'm sure there will be some objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| but I'm making this as a motion that we appoint this entire commission to serve as BZA pending action by the state house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3227)|
| 0:53:59| to correct this injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Commissioner, the state – I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| The state law that mandates the creation of a Board of Zoning Appeals specifically says that for charter counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| there can only be three, five, or nine members to a Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| So this entire body cannot serve as a Board of Zoning Appeals and comply with that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Can this body, through ordinance or resolution, determine that those nine members must be elected county commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3269)|
| 0:54:41| Again, and I understand they can appeal this to the court system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| but you've got to understand this is an appeal process that's set up if someone is unhappy with a decision made by another appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| board, the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And I think MPC works really hard, and I think that for the most part they make very good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| But I think that the citizens should be able to appeal those decisions to an elected body rather than an appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| And that's why I believe that those should be commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| because if we do not have the BZA comprised of elected officials like commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| then the citizen who has a grievance with the Metropolitan Planning Commission will have to go through two tiers of appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3318)|
| 0:55:27| bureaucracies before they get to the judge who is an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Now, I understand what the law says, but I also understand that that law is most likely going to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| And what I don't want to happen is in the interim I don't want us to create a bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| That is another step that people have to go through before getting to that elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Can we through ordinance or resolution say that members of BZA must be members of this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3350)|
| 0:56:03| I would recommend that you not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| And the reason that I cannot recommend that you take that action is because I think it subjects Knox County to the likelihood of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3367)|
| 0:56:19| And I don't believe that it is legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| That's why I've recommended otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Even though you know that this will most likely be changed by the state house this term and that we're going to have to go back and start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3390)|
| 0:56:42| I can't speculate on whether or not the legislature will, in fact, pass the proposed legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| It could be changed at some point during the deliberative process in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| It could be changed in the other chamber of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| Furthermore, again, going back to the presentation I made, that proposed legislation says that, again, going back to that fourth line from the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3422)|
| 0:57:22| it's only going to affect things to the extent that if such member could have legally accepted such appointment prior to May 6, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3442)|
| 0:57:33| we still have that Supreme Court decision that was out there even before this law was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3453)|
| 0:57:44| And that Supreme Court decision says that members who have a point of authority should not appoint members of their own body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3464)|
| 0:57:55| Mr. Lockett, and I do respect your opinion, and I read the law and I see it simply right there on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| But I've talked to two other attorneys that have said that it's a defendable position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| We're not going to change his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And that's not even the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| If those lawyers, are they going to come in and defend Knox County and pay the legal expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| And I have the court decision here with me, the State v. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| And on page five, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| It is contrary to public policy to permit an officer having an appointing power to use such power as a means of conferring an office upon himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3515)|
| 0:58:46| or to permit an appointing body to appoint one of its own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| It goes on to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| The common conscience of mankind revolts at the idea that a group of officers holding the power of appointment should confer such a position or office upon one of their number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3534)|
| 0:59:08| That's our Supreme Court stating the public policy of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| And it is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Even if this passes, it's not going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I don't remember if we've got a resolution now, but I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Real quick, does the Ethics Committee fall under this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Because I'm on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3575)|
| 0:59:44| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Mr. Law Director, I'd like to at least take this moment to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the work that you've done on this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| I think you've done a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| I think you've done a scholarly job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| I think you've done a prudent job in advising this body as to what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| And I recall not too long ago I stood before this body and the people of Knox County who were present right here in the middle of this floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| And I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| And I took an oath to uphold the laws of the state of Tennessee and the charter of this commission and of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3620)|
| 1:00:29| And we now stand before us arguing about whether we're going to uphold the law of this state, the Constitution of this state, and the charter of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3629)|
| 1:00:41| Whatever we resolve here, I can tell you what Bud Armstrong is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Number one, I'm going to keep my oath and my promise to the people of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| And I will not serve on any board or any commission whether we vote on it or not that is in contrary to the Supreme Court of this state, to the Constitution of this state, to the statutes of this state, and to this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3650)|
| 1:01:07| So where I'm standing on this is we probably need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| I think we've killed enough time debating about whether it's the law or not the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| The current state of the law is we can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| It's pretty simple to this old country boy that can see we can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And our law director has made it real clear, and I think in a very scholarly way, to advise us as best he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3684)|
| 1:01:32| And I think we need to move on on this issue and deal with it legally, prudently, and responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Bill, I want to ask you some things about BZA that you brought up at our BZA meeting with regards to the makeup of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| You said that we would have to appoint like seats one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Could we do District 1 would have a representative, District 2, or is it just kind of open that we would just have nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Could we do it by district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Also, you had said that you believed that these BZA people would need to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| So regardless of what we do, whoever does it would have to be actually sworn and take a legal oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| And also the staggered terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I think you had mentioned that BZA, that our charter or something, calls for a staggered term like number one would serve for two years and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| Have you looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| The charter doesn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| The ordinance talks – what we did when we passed the enabling – the ordinance acting on the enabling legislation was provide that the first member would be appointed –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3753)|
| 1:02:53| the first members would be appointed in September of 1993 and that they would change membership each year thereafter, which would result in some people serving for a lengthy period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3773)|
| 1:03:08| I think what you propose in terms of appointing members to represent a particular district is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3788)|
| 1:03:23| There's nothing to prohibit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| The state law prohibits anyone from serving a term that exceeds five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3805)|
| 1:03:34| So what you have to do to comply with state law is either have three, five, or nine members, and our ordinance says nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3814)|
| 1:03:43| And no term can last more than five years, and they should be staggered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| With regards to the BZA, and I understand what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3829)|
| 1:03:59| You're advising us to not go to court and to try to resolve this in a way that is legal and is the path of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| And I understand that and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I was ready to go to war over the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I'm not ready to go to war over BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| In fact, I've already resigned from BZA because of the things that we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| I would just like to point out a couple of things to my colleagues here, having served on the BZA now for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And that is I would like to recommend that we not have the BZA meeting this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| I would like, if we're going to consider putting citizens on, that we take our time and look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| and that we find qualified people, good people, to serve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| And let me take just a moment to explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| The things that you look at on BZA is everything from somebody wanting to put a swimming pool in their backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| to a developer who needs to have a variance of some setbacks because they're trying to build a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| and they find out it just doesn't work because of topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| We had, just at our last meeting, a very contentious thing over the definition of a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| What is a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Landscaping has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| We've had neighbor versus neighbor set here in BZA, and there's a lot of legal ramifications here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| Again, this is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| This is the last chance that people have before they go to chancellery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And so I would just like to recommend that we cancel BZA this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| And I realize it may have some impact on some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| But if we hurriedly do this, and if we hurriedly just put a bunch of people on just so we can have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| I don't think that's in the best interest of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| I think it is in our best interest for, for example, a reason I ask a thing about the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| I'd like for Commissioners Luthold and Briggs and I to sit down in the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| perhaps invite people to come and meet with us who would have an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| and let's come up and let's look at people, their qualifications, because, as I mentioned, this is important to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| The two most important things is family and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| And when you're dealing with somebody's property, you better get it right and do your due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| So I would just like to recommend that, I guess I'll make that in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| that we cancel BZA this month and that we look at these staggered terms, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| but that we also look at each individual district, maybe come back with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| And I'm open, Mr. Law Director, to anything you might advise us on, on how we word this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| But I'm just thinking that if we try to do BZA this month and hurriedly put citizens on, that's not in the best interest of our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| Bill, do we have authority to cancel BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| We have the authority to schedule it or not schedule it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| When that, this bonding, because that, like you said, that's a separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Well, right now, I don't believe there are enough members on BZA to constitute a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| So all you're doing in effect is canceling a decision on filling the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=3999)|
| 1:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| And I would point out that in line with Commissioner Hammond's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| state law recognizes the importance and the technical aspects of serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| In performing our research, and I think I mentioned this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| state law actually requires that a county pay for and send the members of BZA to annual training concerning the matters that would come before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4027)|
| 1:07:22| So state law recognizes that it is very, at times, involves technical questions regarding land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4042)|
| 1:07:32| and that the members of that board should receive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| And in the memo that I sent to members of the commission, simply as a suggestion, this is obviously, as I've said before, your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4056)|
| 1:07:51| I'm here just to try to state the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| But in other areas, folks are chosen as members of the BZA because they might have particular expertise by way of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4076)|
| 1:08:10| or training in matters that would further qualify them for serving on a board such as BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4090)|
| 1:08:19| I'd like to second Commissioner Hammond's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| I want us to be mindful of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| We have intergovernmental and some of us still have to go to pension board at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Now, if we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| If I might, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I want to clarify my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I guess what I'm hearing is I'd like to make a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I guess the BZA is already canceled because we don't have anybody to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| But I would also like to make as part of that motion that we come at our March meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| with recommendations on who would fill the nine positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| And this gives us time in our districts to meet and to bring forward some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| Can you specify that that's one recommendation per district in that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| Yes, that would be part of the motion is it would be one recommendation per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| And these would all be done in public hearings in each individual district so people can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| But anyway, that's that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| You have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Can we go ahead and vote on that today or the way the law and where our ordinance is written right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| Or do we need to amend our ordinance in order to comply with what Commissioner Hammond is proposing in order to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4175)|
| 1:09:46| to appoint the citizens in this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| I'm in favor of I just want to make sure that we're doing it in accordance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| I think we've provided for the things that are in our ordinance in terms of members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4193)|
| 1:10:02| There being nine seats and staggered terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Those are the most important things in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| I believe we're trying to comply with both our ordinance and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| So I think what Commissioner Hammond has proposed in his motion will cover both of those bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| And my other question is we already have some citizens serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| And as far as I understand, they would continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| And so those districts are would not need to bring forth a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| And I also would point out that we do at some point need to address this issue in terms of amending our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4237)|
| 1:10:50| And that ordinance might follow in lockstep with the action that's been proposed by motion by Commissioner Hammond today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4250)|
| 1:11:02| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| But we will need a more permanent solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| And I guess maybe that's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| This may be a temporary, but we may need to come back in a more formal resolution or, I guess, ordinance to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4270)|
| 1:11:21| I think even the staggered terms because I don't even know District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| We asked someone to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| How long are they being appointed for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| And that's all of that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| And that, I think, is Commissioner Hammond has, if I understand what he's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| is that we'll come back with a more formal recommendation that achieves all of those ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| And let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| We're having to cancel or BZA is going to have to cancel this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| And if we don't make appointments until our regular meeting in March, which would be on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4314)|
| 1:12:03| normally it's that on Wednesday of that week is when BZA meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Will they be ready to have a March meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Yes, it depends on who you appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Aren't they required to have training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| I believe they are for the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| That's what I mentioned a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Well, if they're required to have training, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| and we can't make these appointments until the Monday, two days later they're going to be coming back to have BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4348)|
| 1:12:36| I'm just curious as to if we may not be able to have a quorum in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| What I'm going to suggest today, and I think that this will work, but it just occurred to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| but if you make appointments in March at a Monday meeting and there's a BZA scheduled for Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4371)|
| 1:13:00| then those new members could, in my office, could prepare an orientation session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4380)|
| 1:13:12| Tuesday morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I mean, to be familiar with what is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| I mean, they're going to get hit up with two months' worth of BZA agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| Well, I'm assuming that the folks who you appoint are ones who come forward and are willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| They're going to be testing under fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Mr. Lockett, what did you, cable TV, was that internal or could it exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Could it exist or not exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I thought we were discussing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Don't forget me in a minute then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Mr. Lockett said that he's going to come back with a whole list of all the committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| and tell us if internal is something we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I'll try to be brief as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| I guess I hesitate doing anything at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| I think we'll be spinning our wheels if we pass this motion that really doesn't give any of us any real understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4458)|
| 1:14:28| of what we're supposed to do when we go back to our districts, when we're looking for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| Because one of the things that I'm concerned with, I agree with Commissioner Armstrong, that this is a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| The Supreme Court spoke out and spoken out loudly, but Commissioner Lambert's point is valid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| We need to get qualified people that understand this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| And is there a way, because this does have like beer board kind of far-reaching judicial tentacles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4490)|
| 1:15:01| and the fact that they're going to take an oath of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| is there a way for us to standardize the qualifications for the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| I mean, they can be fairly vague, but if we could somehow get a template for the type of person that we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| I think it would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| There's nothing to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| And, you know, I hate to throw the word task force, but somehow we need to have a meeting on this to figure out the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| District four will have X number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| District one will have X number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| That way, when we're approaching these people, we know this will be a three-year appointment for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| then you come back up, or this will be a seven-year appointment for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And it doesn't matter to me whichever way we go, but I just hesitate us stepping out and doing this and then having to backtrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| I think if we do nothing, the BZA is canceled for the month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| There will be two members, so they won't get a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| And I think we also realize we're going to get one per district, but that's all we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| So I'm just concerned that we're doing something that might confuse us even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| My question, Mr. Law Director, was can we – there's no way that the charter –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| I know the Supreme Court decision is the ruling law of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| but our charter doesn't give us any benefit of making the BZA all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| We don't have that opportunity with our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| My questions are not to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| I've got more general questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| I would just like to ask the law director, and I guess Jolie, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| If me and Commissioner Brown are either going to meet the first or second week in March to take applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| then I just wonder if it would be possible to get every applicant a copy of the agendas to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| to where they can study them before they'll be on the go when we appoint one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| There's no – that's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| There's no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| No, but I mean we need to get it to them so they can look over the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| A lot of people maybe don't have access to a computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and, you know, that way like if there's five people in the 9th District, all five of them can be studying the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| then we appoint them, whichever one we appoint, and they go Tuesday for your schooling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| and that makes them qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Actually, the schooling I think is not a legal – it is a legal requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| but it has to take place within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| It doesn't have to take place before they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| They could meet without – I was just suggesting that it would be fairer to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| to have a small orientation session before throwing them in the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| But to answer your question, Commissioner, you know, depending on how many applicants you get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| you could just tell the commission office and we could make the agenda available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| copies sufficient to provide to the number of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| Well, the reason why I'm saying that is we're going to have a very large agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| like Commissioner Lutho said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| It's going to be two months, and these people are going to be new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| and we don't know which one the commission might appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| so all of them need to have a copy of the agenda to be going over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Mr. Law Director, are there certain requirements such as residency within the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4716)|
| 1:18:45| Must they be a registered voter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| Are there certain such – in order to run for election, you must meet these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| I was just wondering, are there certain requirements on these BZA members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Does they be a resident of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Do they have to be a registered voter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Is there any other requirements that they must meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| The state statute does not set forth requirements about being a registered voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| I believe it does have a requirement that they be a resident of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| But other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| If you could just research that, just in case there are any requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| so that as we go through and try to make these selections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| that we stay within what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| You're light, if not to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Could you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| The motion is basically that we let the public know that there will not be a BZA meeting this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| and that between now and the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| each individual district commissioner will hold public hearings to ask people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| or I guess to accept applications from people who are interested, go through an interview process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| and then at the March meeting perhaps come forth with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| If the commissioners can't agree, then maybe there will be a couple of people that would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| But we would spend the time at our meeting in March asking any questions of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| that would be up for Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| As far as the meetings are concerned, I like Commissioner Pinkston's idea that those who are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| they go ahead and get a copy of the agenda so that they're kind of familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| We could do an orientation session on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| This would just be known for the people that were interested in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| But I think we need to put out a call for interested individuals to come and meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| so that we can fully gauge the interest and also get qualified folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Well, that would be easier done if everybody, when you set your meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| clear it through the office and let the office make one general announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| District one is at such and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Two here are running down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| Is everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Put me down as a no too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Sixteen to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Is there anything else, Duke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| We can, the Vacant Property Review Commission, we can deal with that when we deal with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| But I think we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| I just heard, I'm authorized to state, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| the way the Vacant Property Review Commission is supposed to work is the mayor appoints nine members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| subject to approval of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and I'm authorized to represent that the mayor will appoint the nine members who this body chooses for BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4895)|
| 1:21:47| to the Vacant Property Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Oh, the same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Commissioner Norman, you said you had something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Mr. Lockett, there's still a lot of questions for some of us about which committees we need to resign from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| Do you have a comprehensive list of committees that we've been appointed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| So is it our responsibility to contact you and ask you individually about each committee that we're on if it's in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| No, he said he's going to get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Isn't that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| You're going to research it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| I'm going to obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| Now, I encourage each of you, if you have questions, to please come to my office anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| because I'm happy to sit down with you and discuss these individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| But I'm in the process of obtaining a complete list of which commissioner is on which committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| and then determining whether that committee or board is one that is affected by the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4966)|
| 1:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| And we're trying to, everybody's trying to be as compliant as we can be with this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and we do appreciate your all's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| And one question would be, for me, I'm still, would it be wise for me to resign from the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| since I've been now reappointed to the beer board by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| Should I have resigned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| I haven't resigned, and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| Let me tell you what I think you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| I think you should resign from the beer board because now, really, pursuant to the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5006)|
| 1:23:35| we don't have a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| We have the county legislative body, and that's who the matters come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| That's what the state statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| It says that the permits and the reviews can either come to the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| or a committee appointed by the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| You are a member of that committee, the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| You should resign from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| And now, by virtue of your membership on commission, that's where these matters come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Again, I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Mr. Lockett, you may have mentioned this in your opening remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| How do you differentiate between an internal and a non-internal committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Why is audit, which is very important to me, an audit committee, and corporations have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| cities have them, counties have them, states have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| We have a multitude of other committees that I never heard of some of them before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| but I got on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Because they're members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| An internal committee would be one that service on goes hand in hand with being a member of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| like intergovernmental or finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| They're members of the audit committee who are not members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Therefore, it's outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| And so by it being a hybrid, having citizens as well as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| that would make it exclusively non-internal then by having other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| And if the overview bill that I guess Commissioner Lambert and others were referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| if that does work its way through the legislature and it removes these prohibitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| then we could come back and reappoint ourselves to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| I know that's hypothetical, but that would legally open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| I assume, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| In my opinion, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Unless there is a statute that requires you to appoint your own members, it doesn't fit the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5142)|
| 1:25:57| And the reason I don't think the overview bill addresses that is because it's limited to what could have happened prior to May 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5157)|
| 1:26:07| And prior to May 2008, we still had the state V. Thompson Supreme Court decision to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5167)|
| 1:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I regret that in regards to the audit committee, which is Mr. Wright and Commissioner Saunders and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| and two very true hardworking professionals out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| They're seeing what we allege be cards abuses and grants and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| Not that we would have found all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| but having a functioning audit committee with the emphasis of having commissioners that can bring it to the meeting every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| I think the citizens will be disturbed by not having that forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| But thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| I'm not going to make you all listen to my speech again because it would be very similar to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| I just want to point out that the Blighted Properties Committee is every bit if not more important than Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| because the Blighted Properties Committee has the power to declare someone's property blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| and set them up for a government taking through them in a domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| And we've just given away that power from elected officials to an appointed bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Bill, pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Can commissioners serve on pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| You just mentioned it, and that's what prompted my interest in getting an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| And that will be part of the research that we're performing that was mentioned by the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| And some of these boards, as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5267)|
| 1:28:01| some of these boards that have an enabling legislation in the legislature set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| that its membership will be constituted of X number of members of the county legislative body and X number of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5289)|
| 1:28:22| I think in those instances, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| And that's part of what we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| And I'm not prepared to give a definitive opinion on the pension board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5313)|
| 1:28:42| I realize the importance of getting you that information in short order, and we are going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Just real quickly, I've submitted my resignation immediately when I received the notification from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| but I wasn't exactly sure of the proper and legal mechanism to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| Because the ethics committee is covered under the Sunshine Law, I can't communicate directly with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| I sent a letter, a mailed letter, to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| I posted a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| I can't give it to the chairman, our chairman right here either, that I wanted to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| So I posted a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I sent a letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| I posted a letter on the commission forum, and then I sent it to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| I mean, can they distribute that, or what's the proper mechanism to resign from these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| That's acceptable, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| That's not a Sunshine Law violation, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| No, it shouldn't be the way I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| I mean, will you or who will send the letter on to the chairman of the ethics committee so he knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| My office will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Motion to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| We have one more light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| That's probably what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| The law director just spoke to enabling legislation about some committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5397)|
| 1:30:09| And I hear to me that sounds like there's controversy involved in we can't sit on certain things because there is no enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5409)|
| 1:30:22| But now if there's enabling legislation which allows us to sit as members of the retirement board or whatever, that pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5422)|
| 1:30:31| I think I'm hearing one thing out of one ear and I hear another thing than when you've moved to this chair over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| It's his evil plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| But, really, that's not the reason that I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| The reason I had my light on was sort of in response to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| Let's flesh that out, though, Commissioner, because I'm not sure exactly where the confusion lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5447)|
| 1:30:57| If there is enabling legislation to allow elected county commissioners to sit on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5457)|
| 1:31:06| then what would the difference be if there is enabling legislation which allows elected county commissioners to sit on XYZ board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5466)|
| 1:31:19| I don't see the difference right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| But you can explain that to me at some future date because there are things that need to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| The thing that needs to go on right now is in sort of response to Commissioner Briggs' question about how do we resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5487)|
| 1:31:36| I publicly and in this forum resign from all committees, boards, commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| whatever we're having trouble with except county commission and except the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5502)|
| 1:31:49| I will retain those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| And I resign from everything else that I have been appointed to here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5511)|
| 1:32:00| Mr. Chairman, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| Craig, on the TTCDA, it's legislatively enabled that I have to be on that as a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5523)|
| 1:32:11| I would ask the law director, but it's my understanding because the TTCDA was set up by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5531)|
| 1:32:21| And there had to be one Knox County commissioner on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Well, I would double check that with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| Commissioner Wright, you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| The TTCDA is Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| I do make a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| I've made a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| I see everyone at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Twelve-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Oh, nineteen of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| Mr. Chairman, I think the luncheon originally scheduled for noon at the East Tennessee History Center has been scheduled for 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5576)|
| 1:33:06| I'll check with Ms. Henderson to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Mr. Chairman, intergovernmental meeting, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| PMBAR, they may want to move that up a little bit, even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| They might want to move it to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090217specialcall?start=5604)|
