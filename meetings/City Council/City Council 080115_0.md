| 0:02:08| I'd like to withdraw 12A, the election ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| 12A, subject of a workshop last week, with really good discussion, the motion and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| is to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=143)|

| 0:02:28| Motion error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| The item is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Anything else to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| First, item 11B for revision for two weeks, and then item 12E as an echo for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=158)|
| 0:02:47| The second one is the senior citizen property tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| I think that's something we probably need to have folks from either the trustees or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| the property assessor's office to give us a little more information about that and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| that works, and maybe we should do that in the form of a workshop and put that in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| with the other workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| So, 11B was for two weeks, and 12E was for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| Let's consider those separately just for clarity's purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Any discussion on 11B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| The motion is to postpone for two weeks, and I see lights, so just, excuse me, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| a second on 11B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Raise your hand if you'd like to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I know the lights apply to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Ready then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| All those in favor of postponing 11B, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| It's postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Now to 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| If you'll raise your hand again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| None?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| The motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=224)|

| 0:03:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| It is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Councilman Becker, and then I'll go to Ms. Fila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| I'd like to postpone 12J for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| This is the rezoning up on Mettler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Some interest in the neighborhood about this affects the recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| We want to have some discussions about how to do that well, so we'd like to take some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| time to talk about it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Seconded by Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| This is 12J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| I think we've all received emails about that, so the motion is to postpone 12J for four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=255)|

| 0:04:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Now, it's rather confusing to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Ms. Pilo and Vice Mayor Brown seem to have swapped their name tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I keep getting them confused, so if you all would swap those back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=293)|

| 0:05:26| Any items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| I don't believe Councilman Bailey says anything else on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| I don't think we have any consent items tonight, so I think that takes us through five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=333)|

| 0:06:24| is developing its 2008 Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| The plan includes projects and activities the City will perform from this July, or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| coming July of 2008 through June of 2009 to address housing, infrastructure, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| and other community needs in the 2005-2009 Consolidated Plan, which I know you're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| used to dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| But there will be a public meeting 530 Thursday the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| That's 530 a week from Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| In the community room at the Kansalowye, 530 Thursday the 24th, Kansalowye MCA Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| That would be a good opportunity for community members to give staff, the point of all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| is so that staff can give input into the plan as it's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| So obviously if you have any contact or questions there, you can contact Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| She's at 215-2120 or by City email as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| I'd like to right now call on John Troyer who has a presentation to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| Please, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Mr. Mayor, thank you, Councilman, thank you for the opportunity to come and address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| Today I represent the Tennessee Government Finance Officers Association and I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| on to recognize Knox, City of Knoxville's Finance Department for the Certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| Achievement for the Excellence in Financial Reporting for 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| Just to let you know that the Certificate of Achievement is for the public finance profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| to an opportunity to recognize those governments that have succeeded in preparing a high-quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| comprehensive annual financial report and this recognition can be viewed as a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| factor by the credit rating agencies and by others interested in the professionalism of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| government finance function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| So anyway, on behalf of Tennessee's GFOA, I'd like to present this award to Jim York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| and the whole Department of Finance of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=500)|
| 0:08:30| If you will indulge me for just a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| This award is actually the result of a lot of hard work on a lot of people in the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| department, people outside the finance department including the internal auditor, our auditing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| staff and we actually appreciate the good work of the audit committee because their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| involvement also helps in achieving this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| So again, on behalf of my staff, I gladly accept this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| I might make a couple of quick notes here if I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| It's my understanding, I hope I have my facts right, I think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| This is the 20th straight year that the city of Knoxville has received that award so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| obviously preceded any of us and Jim's been here most of that time for us but it's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| significant as I understand it, to put that in context, that's longer, that's more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| in a row than any city government in the state of Tennessee has won the award so this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| just one of those things that automatically you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I think we've set a new record for the most consecutive years and I think it's a tribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| to all those folks that Jim mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Also, I want to thank John for coming, a lot of you all know that John is the county finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| director and has been great for us to work with and we really appreciate the spirit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| he brings to the relationship and they're obviously key partners with us and John has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| been great for us to work with and we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| We know you've got a full-time job and we appreciate you taking time to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| tonight and represent the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| You need to be proud of your finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Thanks a lot, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| And Jim, congratulations and please thank all your team for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Okay, the only other report I have is two weeks ago, Councilman Frost asked us to update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| him on the McClung Warehouse situation and I think Bill Lyons has a quick report to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Right, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We were asked to provide an update by Councilman Frost and we're glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| Basically, this has been a concern, obviously, of the cities even prior to and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| since the unfortunate fire that took place on Jackson and what we've done is proceeded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| The buildings, the old one-story blighted buildings that are on 514, 523 and 525 Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| have been referred to the Better Building Board for their action and the other buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| of course, are the remaining McClung Warehouse buildings, the taller buildings that I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| to, we're having that still proceed under the KCDC redevelopment plan, so I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| to call on Dan Tiller to explain what KCDC is doing with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Mr. Mayor, City Council, without reading the entire two-page letter that we sent Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| to Mr. Saroff, please allow me to summarize what's in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| The redevelopment proposals that Mr. Saroff originally submitted were not approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| the advisory board because they did not comply with the redevelopment plan and then subsequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| revised proposals for the redevelopment of these properties was not approved by the advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| board either, again, due to noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Our CEO and our attorney met with Mr. Saroff and his attorney to try to establish a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| framework for redevelopment of those properties and based on these discussions, our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| sent a letter dated April 3rd, 2006 that outlined a process to remediate the visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| blight that affects these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Mr. Saroff responded on May the 8th confirming that several tasks would need to be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| but requested a lengthy time frame and given this positive reaction by him and his attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| and based on this information, we proceeded to begin preparation of a redevelopment agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| Soon we were told that Mr. Saroff was in the process of selling these properties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| we wanted to give the prospective purchasers time and opportunity to submit an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| plan and then shortly thereafter, a fire destroyed two of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| Our letter states also that those properties are vacant and blighted but do not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| an imminent threat to the public as the remaining structures do and that it is imperative that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| redevelopment of the remaining structures commence immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| Finally, Mr. Saroff has been informed that although a satisfactory proposal has never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| been submitted and has not shown a willingness to cooperate with KCDC, we've concluded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| one final opportunity to submit a revised proposal due to the change of circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| as a result of the fire is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| So he has been given 30 days to respond to our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| If we do not receive a satisfactory response, we will ask the KCDC Board to authorize staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| to issue a request for proposals from third parties and to begin acquisition of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| properties as permitted under applicable law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| There are questions from Mr. Tiller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| So is that 30 days from last Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| 30 days from last Friday, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Only the second week of February action will be taken, whether he submits a plan or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| Board acts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Those are other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Maybe this is better for Chief Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| What's the status of the fire investigation on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I mean, you know, it sounds like, you know, Mr. Saroff said people came in and set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| place on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Is there, I mean, where do we stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| The investigation is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Our fire investigation unit, along with the Knox County Arson Task Force, is still looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| They have people of interest they're looking at, but I can't comment other than that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| the investigation is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| But it was certainly arson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| It was certainly arson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| They're looking at that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| I can't comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Ms. Pillow, and then we'll go to Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Well, I want to comment on something that occurred last weekend, and I'm going to preface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| it by saying, you know, did you ever just do something that was just so good that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| turned out to be a disaster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Did you ever just do something that was just so successful that it was just a mess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Well, you know, I want to congratulate everyone who was involved last Saturday in the recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| effort with computers and cell phones and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| It was like a UT football game, and you were giving away the tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| It was incredible, the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| I enjoyed an hour and 10 minutes sitting between Kingston Pike and Goodies on North Peters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| And I called some people to tell them what a good time we were having and how wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And so I just want to really congratulate the community and neighboring communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| and probably most of East Tennessee for their understanding of the environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| that caused us to need to be patient in line and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| I want to commend all the volunteers and everyone who helped with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| But I'd really like to challenge the powers that be, whoever they might be, to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| We really, we actually aided food workers, because I felt so sorry for those folks because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| people couldn't get to their restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| But it was just such a wonderful thing that it turned out to be a bit of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| But again, I want to thank everyone who was involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And I understand, I think Mr. King, you told me it was about midnight when everybody pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| up stakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| They were supposed to quit at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And they stayed with it and took care of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| So it's such a good thing that now we need to find out how to do it on another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| We have definitely noted the need for a new, that's a fair request and it will definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| They asked me if I'd had complaints from businesses or something, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| And I said, no, I am the complainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| I'm sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| We will find a better location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| We're happy it was so successful, but we definitely need a better location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| First, we had a very good workshop here recently about the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And out of that workshop, one of the charges was that we put together a, quote, subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| to talk about the civic participation, I guess is, for lack of a better term, at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| And I had asked for a couple of councilmembers to indicate to me their willingness to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| so that that committee could go out, help capture the issues, help formulate the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| and collect some data to come back for a larger workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| And I'd like to report out that I've had three councilmembers who have indicated they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| And I'm going to share Chris Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| And he's agreed to chair the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Councilman Holquist, who volunteered that night, has come back and told me he definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| wants to be involved, and also Councilman Becker, with regards to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| And as council wanted, we will actually bring back their data and issues as they put them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| for the full vetting of the full council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| So we do have that process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And I will leave it to those fine gentlemen to get themselves together and review the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| and go forward with their charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Also, I'd just like to report out, with regards to the P&I appointments, we hope to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| by the next council meeting, all the council-recommended appointees to the P&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| We've had ZAC meetings from the West ZAC involving the councilmembers there and the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| the North ZAC, Central ZAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| We've got another Central ZAC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| We've had Northwest meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| We have appointees that have been designated, but we'll bring those names to the full council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| those appointees from the West, the North, and the Northwest ZAC have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| I'd like to thank Director Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| She's been in every one of those, been a fine trooper, right with her map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| and her data and information for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| And we actually, both of us, feel very excited about what's coming out of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| and it looks like we're getting some good involvement and going to have some geographic diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| and also have a good group of individuals that are going to move forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| And then, as last, I'd like to point out that please remember that this weekend is Martin Luther King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| There are a lot of activities going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| I don't want to send someone to the wrong place, but do realize that there's a luncheon on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| There's a youth symposium on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| There's also the march Monday morning and also the noon program at Greater Warner on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| For more information, I'm sure there will be advertisements in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| and other folks you can talk to with regards to those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| But I encourage all Knoxvilleans to participate and come out and support what I think is a great function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| and a great activity for all Knoxvilleans to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| It's also on the city's website at cityofknoxville.org, all the schedules on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Excellent. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| I just wanted to call Councilmembers' attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| In your mail pack, either tonight or sometime this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| you should have found information from the Tennessee Municipal League District 2 meeting that took place earlier this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| and Councilman Hultquist and I both attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And I was impressed with the breadth and the detail of the information they presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and asked our staff to make copies of the agenda and the accompanying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| In particular, there are two packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| and one gives a single-page update on each of the legislative priorities that TML will be lobbying on city's behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| during the upcoming legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| The second packet deals with legislative issues that are kind of out there still pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| that they are not necessarily lobbying for or against during this upcoming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| And those in particular are some issues that we have spoken about in this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| There's an update on the Open Government Study Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| There's an update on the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act that is set to expire at this point on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| We've talked about that with Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Freeze, which we talked about earlier this evening, is addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| and also red light cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So it's a real wealth of information, and I would encourage you to peruse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| It was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Did you want to say something about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Just to follow up on that, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I think it was a great meeting, and I would say that I think, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| you were at one in the past at Sevierville that you and I went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| They've gotten much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| They really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I agree with Councilman Roddy that they're very, very good meetings now and very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| The TML staff has really come a long ways with those meetings and what they present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| If you will recall, toward the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| we had some lively conversations about charitable solicitations at designated intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| and I guess what we did was we tabled it, which basically means that it's still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| It's something we want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| and Vice Mayor Brown has asked me to chair a committee of willing participants to come up with some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1317)|
| 0:22:11| or some shared vision around perhaps continuing this practice and taking into consideration safety considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1331)|
| 0:22:22| Actually, I'm getting a late start, and I just wanted to apologize for the late start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| I wanted to inform my colleagues that I will be convening this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| I believe Councilman Becker is the only person who wants to really sit in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Everyone else is welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| You would like to also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I'd like to join you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| I've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| I'd like to know about it and come if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| You'd like to know about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| I'd like to know when it is so I can come if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I thought I was telling you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I'm sorry for the late start, and I'll get busy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| We'll convene in the next couple of weeks, and you will know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1387)|

| 0:23:09| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Just a reminder, early voting starts January 16th for your federal and Knox County elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1390)|

| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1404)|

| 0:24:16| I don't believe this is something that has been done in recent memory by the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| but we had an excellent meeting in December where we were in receipt of the draft financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1461)|

| 0:24:28| We had a lengthy two-and-a-half-hour meeting, and I think it was the best audit that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Audit Committee has received, at least in my tenure with the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| We were so pleased, both of the cooperation of the Finance Department and our auditors'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| ability to finish the audit in a timely basis by December, which is always our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| We extend our congratulations to the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Once again, it was an excellent year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| The findings in the audit are very minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| They were very forthcoming in discussing with us any small areas that might have been of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| concern, and such a great deal of work goes into this not only by our outside auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| but also by our own Finance Department to get all that information to the auditors on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| a timely basis and to work with them in providing that public information that we thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| was worthy of a resolution tonight just to recognize the work of all involved and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Council to formally accept this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| And if any other members of the Audit Committee would like to chime in, I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I'll just chime in as a member of the Committee and second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| And I'll just say, Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| And I would just like to say that I appreciate your leadership on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| You run a very efficient meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1545)|

| 0:25:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1547)|

| 0:25:50| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1550)|

| 0:25:59| the management and implementation of the Empowerment Zone Small Business Loan Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1559)|

| 0:26:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| I actually wanted to just take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| It's impressive how much has happened in a year, but we're still a smidgen short of our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| I'd like to ask, I don't know if Ms. Nichols or Mr. Adams, somebody to talk about what sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| of the next, looking back, what should we have done different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| What's the next thing we want to do so that we can really make this program fly and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| get a little reflection on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| Phyllis, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Phyllis Nichols, 9711 Valley Woods Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| A different agenda this year, and it is really our pleasure to come and talk about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I think we have provided Council a detailed accounting of what has happened over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I think we all started seeing it was hard work and we knew there was a big rock in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We didn't realize how heavy that rock was, but we got that rock moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| I think that because the program had actually been stalled, it took us a while to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1640)|
| 0:27:29| momentum going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| One of the most encouraging things for me and our board and also the staff is that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| we have been doing for the last six or eight months has really produced some results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And so we think that with that momentum and also developing partnerships, getting a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| in place, now it's about full implementation of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| We're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| We are getting great public response from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| I think we have adequately marketed the program that it is a loan program, and it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1686)|
| 0:28:16| our endeavor to market the program throughout the Empowerment Zone so that throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| 16-square-mile area, residents, business and potential business owners, people are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| of this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| What does the future look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| For us, and one of the learning curves for us, is that we had 29 applicants who came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| and they were ready to get an EZ Loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| And these were people who had everything from people who had a great idea to thought that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| you know, they lived in the Empowerment Zone and this was something easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| But what we know to have sustainable results for this program is that we have to educate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| about being a business owner, about entrepreneurship, and about sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| And that's not done overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| We started an entrepreneurship class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| The first class we had, I think we had six to register, and, you know, a few showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| The next one we had 10 to register, and eight came, and more importantly, eight completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| And so these are people now who have some understanding of what they need to do in order to position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| themselves to be business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| And so one of the core competencies of the Urban League and what we have brought to the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| is this education component, preparing people, providing the technical assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| and aligning ourselves with people like the University of Tennessee College of Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| to make this a sustainable program for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Thank you, Phyllis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Let me say that I'm real glad to see how this is progressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| and I hope that I want the record to reflect that while it was pointed out that maybe some of the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| I think early on when we had the meeting at the Urban League, when we had our initial discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| you know, that was one of my concerns, that we make sure that we not set our benchmarks so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| that it would be very difficult for the Urban League to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| And I thought they were high then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| I think we lowered them a little bit, and they may still be a little high for my liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| But I commend them for what they've done, you know, and how close they really got to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| So I hope we see this as not the glass being half full, but the glass being more than, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| not being half empty, but being more than half full here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| And I commend it's very difficult to do this type of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| And I was very concerned about the impact it would have on the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and the goals that were set there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| And you guys have done really a great job in these first couple of months of getting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| and I'm glad to see we're renewing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| I was glad to hear that it was going to be recommended to be renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And I think if we continue to set realistic goals in light of all the barriers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| and the difficulty and the educational curve that we have to come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| I think we'll see that goals will be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| and we'll see that this program is going to bring great benefits in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| And I'd also like to just say that we appreciate the technical assistance that's been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| by the Community Development Director and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Ms. Pilham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| I was just about to ask the Community Director herself, Ms. Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| if she had any comments she would like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Well, we're very pleased to bring this to you again for renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I wanted to add, though, that the Partnership for Neighborhood Improvement Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| looked at this contract last week, and they voted unanimously to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| Well, I just want to congratulate you all on what you've done when this came before us earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| It was obvious a lot of hard work was going to have to go into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| to make a report such as you've given tonight possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| And just thank you for staying with it and wish you the best in the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| where I think maybe the direction is a little clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| I appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| I just wanted to make sure before I get misquoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I wasn't implying that the work is only half done or it's only half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| I think the glass is 95% full, Councilman Becker just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| I just wanted to point out that we should look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| and what they've done is just being very, very, very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| And I'm very proud to be an Urban Leader, and good to see you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1965)|

| 0:32:48| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=1968)|

| 0:37:33| I wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| This is actually a really exciting location close to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| and the applicant originally asked for a plan amendment and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| to be in the downtown district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| and MPC staff recommended the C-3, the mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| And looking at the downtown north I-275 corridor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| this is sort of an area that, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| we're going to be developing some new zonings on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| and I wanted just sort of to give us a timing on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| and where we're going with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Well, we're currently working on some new form-based zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| for the Central Avenue corridor that's a part of that redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| When we complete that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| we'll then turn our attention to the area that's generally described between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| railroad and the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| and I think that presents some opportunities for what I would call kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| hybrid form district where you have both industrial opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| and opportunities for some mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| This particular site probably has some real mixed use opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| but we weren't quite ready to declare it a part of the central business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| and grant the C-2 zoning, which has virtually no limit to height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| waives parking requirements, and allows some residential mixed use right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| But once we complete the Central Avenue districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| we'll turn our attention to the others in that redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| Just real quick, I'm excited about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| and I think this area does have a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| And when you say when you finish Central, as timing goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| is this something we're getting in another year, another two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| We have some drafts currently for the Central Avenue districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| and we'll be going public with those very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2379)|

| 0:40:17| Yeah, for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Generally, it was basically started out as a beautification of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| He sort of looked at it as something that had been forgotten about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2423)|

| 0:40:31| and all this activity that could be moved down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| So with the electric ballroom having so much history that it did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| which is at 1213 Western Avenue, it's a 10,000-square-foot facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| there's a lot of history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| There's a lot of musical history there, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And the area just kind of fell into ruin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| and for years he admired the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| and always dreamed about what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| So when he purchased the building and started renovating it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| and spending 14 hours a day down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| he realized this whole area has potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| These warehouses have potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And when he knew that Braden's was selling the warehouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| he wanted to make sure that he could be a part of those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| So that's kind of how it began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Mr. Hoeklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Is the current owner still Chazen Holdings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Did you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| The applicant is different from the current owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| It's Chaz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I'm trying to remember the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| It's a mixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| B-H-A-Z-E-N Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| They purchased the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| and I think that it's his partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| but I'm not totally sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Because Taraz Investments, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| is the people that purchased the whole entire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| the electric ballroom and the Braden's buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| and those are Gary Mitchell's partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| So it's Chuck Williams and Teresa Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| A lot of different things can be done under C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I'm just concerned, as Councilman Frost was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| about exactly what they had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Is Braden's going somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Braden's is going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Most likely the buildings are going to be used for storage for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| and then eventually, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| we can refurbish them and make them into event facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| where you can rent and have weddings, receptions, proms, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| And then the electric ballroom, we've already renovated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and it's just a very large event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Mr. Holquist, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I mean, Mr. Donaldson, based on what you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| do they need a rezoning at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| The current zoning of industrial wouldn't allow that sort of commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| I mean, the electric ballroom is continuing use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| so they wouldn't need a rezoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I mean, it's not called the electric ballroom now, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Wouldn't that be preexisting nonconforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| I'm not familiar with the history of that particular building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| but the zoning request, the district expands beyond just that single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| Okay, but, I mean, if Braden's isn't going anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| and they're using them for warehousing right now, just…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| But if we start renovating the buildings in April and May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| and we wanted to put another music hall down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| or we wanted to have weddings and receptions down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| would we need to have the C3 to start doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| or would we have to go through the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| I believe it's likely that you would, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| if a use has been changed during the course of a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| So from what I understand, he's been working on this for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| so I think we just need to follow through with what it's all been agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| I think that we have to do the C3, so we just have to go through the process all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| I just wanted to say that I know Gary Mitchell, who's one of the partners in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| and it's my understanding that he has reopened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| what was formerly known as the electric ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| It's called the Valarium, and he spent upwards of $600,000 refurbishing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| to make it the kind of, and I believe Ashley Capps is booking a lot of the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah, AC Entertainment's doing all our booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| So it's a venue that's heading in a very different direction than before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| and I know that the Braden's building, I'm convinced after talking to Gary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| that they really want to do something that is consistent with downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| I don't know what that is, whether it's art studios or a restaurant or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| but there's just a lot of, I think, responsible attention that's being paid to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| and it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| It's unfortunate that Gary couldn't be here, and I know you're being put on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and you're actually doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Honestly, I really do apologize for not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| I mean, Gary is much more eloquent than I am, and he...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| No, you're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| He puts a lot more, I mean, he thinks about 30 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| and I don't know how much time he's put into everything, and so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Anyway, I think they're doing good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Councilman Huqquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Well, it sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| I'm just going back to, I think, where Councilman Frost was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| If you're moving in the direction that the form-based code or some hybrid of that would be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| I don't have a problem with rezoning it in the sense of I think there's some level of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| We know where you all are going with this, but it would be great to know that you'll work with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| and with MPC on further rezoning that might even be more conducive to what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| and where we'd like to see the area go as the MPC is ready to take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| Oh, no, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| I mean, from day one of this project in August, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| we've been working with the city and researching about how you can work with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| and what they're looking for and what we're looking for and what the community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| And so, I mean, nothing's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| No step is going to be made without Chris or anyone else knowing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| what's going on and being able to put in their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| So we need all the help we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2843)|

| 0:49:14| I don't know if she wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Come on down, Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Terri, would you prefer to speak first or would you like – I think some of the developers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I just – Terri is the only name I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| If you all want to come down and speak to that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| I think Chris Martin, who is with the developers and along with Jason Chandler are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| Jason, if you want to go ahead and pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| My name is Chris Martin, and I live at 408 Sundown Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| Jason Chandler is one of the principals of the developer, North Shore Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| Basically, this petition of rezoning principally relates, if you look at the color-coded zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=2991)|
| 0:50:02| to what we refer to as the hole in the donut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| This property is located on the east side of North Shore Drive in the Bearden-Humberg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| It has previously been rezoned 03 and 01, and there was a small house at the end of B Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| which is a dead-end street and has no through access at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| and because of topography really can have no through access at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| And Mr. Chandler's company was able to acquire that little square dot there that's zoned R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3035)|
| 0:50:45| and there was a dilapidated house on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| There was also a dilapidated house adjoining it in the 03 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| Those have now been completely raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| And so what we're asking is to make R1 03 so that it's consistent with all the commercial zoning around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| And at MPC's suggestion, just to make it consistent to make the 01 zone 03 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3064)|
| 0:51:14| And the attachment on the back of the zoning map will give you a flavor for what the architectural design is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3074)|
| 0:51:25| This is not finalized, but it is going to be a traditional look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| It will be office condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| It will be a very high-quality finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| My client already owns all of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Project funding is in place, and they are ready to proceed as soon as they get their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| And then we have the one other item, which Ms. Pelow was kind enough to get passed for us one additional time on the final closure of B Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| We're going to take that road completely private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| In fact, Mr. Chandler was out at the property a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| and noticed that the city had a repaving crew out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| And we made some quick calls and waved them off because there was absolutely no reason to repay B Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| We're going to do that for the city as a part of the redevelopment of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| And generally, we think that the property is going to have an extremely low impact on the neighborhood because of the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3139)|
| 0:52:30| The property slopes very sharply up east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| And if you actually stand on Agnes Drive behind this property, you really can't even see anything because it's an immediate fall off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3154)|
| 0:52:44| And we submit that the plans for the development of this property are entirely consistent with what has been going on around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3164)|
| 0:52:56| And we welcome any questions you may have, but would ask City Council to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Mr. Martin, when I looked at it, I mean, it's interesting you said you can't see down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| But from B Drive looking up, you're looking at people's backyards and you're seeing the back windows on the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| And I'm wondering, is this you're going to cut out some and have a steeper slope there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| And what's your plan between the back of your building and the houses that are up on, is that Agnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| There are actually two homes on Agnes, as you will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And we have been in contact with not only those two property owners, but also with Ms. Williams and Ms. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| who live on Agnes across the street from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| We have also been in contact with the owners of Cambridge Arms Apartments, which are immediately south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| We have also been in contact with the Toole family, who owns the property immediately to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| and with Ed Campbell and groups associated with him who did the development immediately to the northeast of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3236)|
| 0:54:06| And all of them, I think, have been fully informed on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Now, to answer your question directly, there will be terraced development in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| and there will be a heavy landscape buffer back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| No offense whatsoever to the people whose homes are back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| but they really don't want to look at us and we really don't want to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| And if you have specific questions about landscaping, Mr. Chandler is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| and I'd be welcome to surrender the podium to him because he has spent hours and hours and hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| with the engineers and the architects addressing that very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| You okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| In the same vein, what are your plans for lighting of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| You know, frequently council looks favorably on office as a transitional zone between a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| and a commercial area because the lighting is less intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Will any of the lights be hooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Will buildings be on all night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Because, as you said, the backs of these houses do look directly down on this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| and if it's terraced going up the slope, I would be concerned about light shining in the back of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Jason, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Because I don't have a direct answer for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| We're working with an architect, but our goal is to be a residential-esque office park, a little boutique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| something that really doesn't draw your eye at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| It wouldn't be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| It wouldn't be desirable, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| If you look at just the simple rendering on the front, you'll see it carries a very sort of low visual impact thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| and we're not looking to make it a commercial office, you know, industrial-esque look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| So that being said, do you anticipate that any of the lights will be hooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| I mean, I assume there will be some security lighting that's on all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Will accommodations be made so that those lights are not glaring into the windows of the adjacent homeowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| We'll do whatever the building code requires for safety from an architectural or civil engineering point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| And we have awnings over the entrance that face the road and the parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| so I'm not sure you'd actually be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| If it's hanging lanterns, it's going to be a residential type of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| So there's no large movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| I was just going to comment, Mr. Chandler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| In my conversations, I will just tell counsel that I have met three times, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| quite at length with Mr. Slade, who is Mr. Chandler's partner, and he cannot be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| He is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| He left town this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| But that question came up, and in our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| I realized that this is of interest to the Agnes Drive residential area and the neighborhood behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| and they have asked questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| It's my understanding from Mr. Slade that you plan to have meetings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| They have some questions that had arisen since the MPC approval, 12-0, of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| And a couple of the ladies were at MPC and expressed some of their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| which Ms. Roddy has alluded to this evening, and one of those was lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| and the other, I think, was a very specific plan for the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| So Mr. Slade had assured me that if such a meeting or a gathering is desired and would be attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| actually, Ms. Williams and Ms. Davis, I believe, met in your office yesterday, or Mr. Slade's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| I don't know if you all work together or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| But they met there and discussed some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| And there were a couple of other things they were particularly concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| And I will have to say this development group has been very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| spent a great deal of time giving consideration to the fact that this is a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| I think Ms. Faulkner will speak to it in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| but the Bearden Council has also been very concerned about the appropriateness of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| and whether it is consistent with the vision plan for Bearden Village and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| And the historical aspects of this little neighborhood are really of a great magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| because this was one of the original settlements in the west area beyond the city of Knoxville downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| So a lot of consideration is being given to how we're going to preserve that historical aspect of a little neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| which right now is just kind of going to ruin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| So I'll let Ms. Faulkner speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But can you confirm the comment I made about Mr. Slade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and you being willing to meet with the neighborhood groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| We are and have and will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Terri, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| I'm Terri Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| I live at 4178 Ridgeway Lane and 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| And I'm happy to have the opportunity to speak about this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| I've been working as a board member of the Forest Heights Homeowners Association since the mid-'80s on beautification in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3570)|
| 0:59:40| And in the last four years as the chairperson of Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| And I have given Barbara Pillow a file of over 90 businesses, 20 developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3585)|
| 0:59:55| and other resources that we have called upon to help us with in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| And this group, we generally have to go to people and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| will you support what we're trying to do in Bearden with good pedestrian access to your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| with landscaping, with money so that we can improve other areas besides the one you're building in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| And this has been a group that came to us and said, can we meet with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| And they have been the most concerned about being adjacent to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| They called me to find out the history of the Lyonsview neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| so they could continue our documentation of historic sites in the Bearden Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| And we met with them at Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| We talked with them about, although they are, the borders of the Bearden Village plan do not include this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| They wanted to participate and try and achieve the goals in that MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| So we've had two meetings, I believe, with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| And I have total confidence that because of their track record with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| and their intentions to work with the neighborhood to document the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| and be a good neighbor that they will do what they have said they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| And thanks for the chance to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| Thanks, Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Yes, just a question for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| How much cutting are you going to have to do into the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| and how high on the slope do you anticipate the building pads, padder pads going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Because under 03, I think the maximum building height is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| It looks like you're probably from the more or less low-slope area adjacent to the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| and B Drive up to the backs of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| On Agnes, it looks like maybe 60 feet in vertical elevation, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| So I'm just trying to get a feel for where you're going to end up on all that slope and that continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| The slope of the property pretty much drives you to have your building on the lower half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| And we're using Robert Campbell and Associates to do our civil engineering site design right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| and we work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| A good mental image is going to be something like Franklin Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| where you see very residential-esque kinds of buildings that are accessed from a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| and upper parking area, and it's very much in line with what you see in the rendering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| in the attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080115?start=3760)|
