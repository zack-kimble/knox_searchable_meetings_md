| 0:00:00| the Knotts County Insolvency Board meeting, looking at, would you like to call a roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| Is that proper or do I, can I say all members present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=10)|
| 0:00:15| Okay, all the members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=15)|
| 0:00:19| First order is the approval of the previous meeting which should have been emailed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=19)|
| 0:00:24| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| It's been properly moved and seconded that we approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| All those in favor, let it be known by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=33)|
| 0:00:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| Those opposed have the same right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=36)|
| 0:00:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| The main point of our meeting today is to evaluate and potentially recommend the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=41)|
| 0:00:49| of the method of disposition, either public auction or negotiated sale for the delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| tax surplus property owned by Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| And approving this will be for less than the taxes owed pursuant to the Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| listed and fixing the offering price of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| So I think, Ben, you want to say something about this or, you all should have a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=71)|
| 0:01:19| of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| So we, just for the record, Ben Charble, Supervisor of Property Development, Asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| Management and Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| We started doing this two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| We took a, state law changed and we took on managing delinquent tax properties where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=91)|
| 0:01:40| purchase at the tax sale and Daniel can describe that process more in depth, but basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| we've had an auction each summer where we take previous properties that we quote unquote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| purchase at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| We don't purchase them, we just inherit them and we go to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| The first auction made approximately $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Last year we made almost a half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| We have an agreement with the city to where we pay pro rata their portion of taxes owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| and basically the way I understand it, we get a lot of questions about is why do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| get properties in the city and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| It's basically whoever owes more taxes, that's who it comes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=139)|
| 0:02:26| We have a group here, 95% of these are delinquent tax properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| There are a few of them that may or may not be, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| We try to be all encompassing so we have our approvals, dot our I's, cross our T's, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| We've been very successful in turning over property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| There are three or four here that the city has requested to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| We will be bringing that before you later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| Properties in flood plain, there's one on Lay Avenue right in the middle of Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| There's no reason for us to own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Others that may go up against, back up to a city park, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| We try to sell all of these through a public auction online process, through Pal Auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| Realty as our current contractor and that process has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| We do have to do a rebid process and a bunch of other stuff like the tax sale per the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| law and that can be quite cumbersome but that process is what it is unless we want to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| to change state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| We will do negotiated sales from time to time but we only do that if the property is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| no one else would be interested other than a neighbor such as a property that's land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| locked, doesn't have good access in a flood plain and the neighbor may want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| There are properties in here in flood plains and we may keep those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| We haven't made all of those determinations yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| We work with Jim Snowden and Public Works, Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| We work with the city, their engineering folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| We try to do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| If you all as commissioners have any suggestions on any of these properties, we are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| willing to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| Now, in terms of selling these properties, we only give a quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| It's very difficult to get title insurance on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| It is quite costly so I would always encourage people to seek out an attorney when they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| to but our goal is ultimately to get these back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| Daniel, anything you want to add about the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| Unless you all have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| One more thing I would like to add is we are going to probably put a, well we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| to qualify our sale a little bit and say put qualifications in there to where a prospective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| bidder or purchaser has to either qualify or cannot be someone who has been delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| on their tax prior because we have had a couple issues where somebody has let a property go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=321)|
| 0:05:30| they have come to bid, they have bidded somebody up, then they haven't paid and we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| go to number two and there are all sorts of fairness and other types of issues with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| that we are trying to deal with so ultimately, like I said, our goal is to get these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| So at what point can't the owner settle up and pay their taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| Has that ship sailed when we get to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| That ship has long sailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| These properties have already been through the one year redemption period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| When they go into Knox County's name, when the deed is recorded by the clerk and master's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| office, that ship has sailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| And again, what we're, please correct me if I'm wrong, we are recommending that the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| commission approve the method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| So does this committee, and this may be to Daniel, this committee has to recommend, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| the full commission will vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Right, there's a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| This committee looks at each property, fixes the price and makes a recommendation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| full commission and then the full commission can do what it pleases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| And then it sounds like, and there may be some difference in the list before it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| No, this list goes to full commission, but where the differencing in the list is we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| you to approve for us to sell these, basically it's called insolvency committee because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| are insolvent on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| People owe taxes, so to speak, we're delinquent, we're not getting our revenue on these taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| That's why it comes before this board, then goes to commission, you approve for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| sell for less than taxes owed and then we, our method is A or N auction or negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| If it's a public auction, it will start at $50, which it's very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| I think the lowest we've ever sold one for is $60 something and the highest is $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| And then if it's a negotiated sale, we won't take any less than $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| That's what this is stating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| We will bring back any sale to you for approval and that's where the list, you know, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| we will bring back negotiated sales individually, or maybe as three or four to one resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| and then like the public auction would be one main resolution of all the transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| and then if there were any intergovernmental transfers to the city, that will come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Or if we just decide to hold on to it, there won't be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| What is the value of taxes owed that comprises this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| I don't have that in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| It varies from probably several thousand dollars all the way up to, I think on 825 Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| Road it's $15 or $16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| To get the full amount, we'd have to go to the city as well and ask them for their values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| But it's, I mean, if we've got 71 properties here, I mean, you know, if you wanted to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| at an average between $5,000 and $10,000, I mean most of these properties you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| going to get anywhere near what taxes are owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| And that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Otherwise they would have sold in the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Is that, do we sometimes wait too long to take a piece of property to tax sales where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| the tax owed has generated to a point that is beyond the value of the property, keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| it from selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| That's more of a question for the trustee's office because they make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Daniel's part of that as a delinquent tax attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| The issue that we have is I believe there are, what is it, 11,000 pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| that we could go declare delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| We just don't have the capacity to, I mean, we also have to manage these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| We also have to make sure they're taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| You know, we've, you know, I know one or two constituents in the first district that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| know, have gotten a hold of us and we've really helped them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| They've not been able to get anything done and we've tried to get their neighborhood's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| properties cleaned up and, I mean, we do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| But we don't take over the management until it gets beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| We take it over as soon as it hits our, we will manage it within the redemption period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| as well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Oh, you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Because there is nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| This was actually an issue, well, at this point it was probably several years ago, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| we were wondering, and it wasn't that we were waiting too long, we were holding onto the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| property too long, but state law was making it really difficult for us to move these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| as soon as we wanted to and we had a group that worked on that for a while and weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| you part of that group, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| And we actually got some state laws changed that made it easier for us to move these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| through at a more reasonable, at a more reasonable rate and was that like maybe five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| that we did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| This process that we're going through now is an outgrowth of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So it's actually much more, it's much quicker and more streamlined now than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| Before the trustee's office was responsible for doing the tax sale and the surplus sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| which is, and they're not really equipped to manage property like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| It was confusing and it was time consuming and state law had all these hoops you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| to jump through and it's just, it is much better now than it was then, but we worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| on it for quite a while, if I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| I would also just make the observation, if there's a piece of property that you or one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| of your constituents would like to see in the tax sale that they know is delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| there's a process by which they can enter an agreement with the clerk and master and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| it will, basically it's an agreement to bid and they'll pay the amount of taxes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| owed into the court and that piece of property will then go into the tax sale process by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| You know, the way it normally happens, we have a set of criteria and those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| go into the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| It may or may not include the one that you want to see, but if you'll enter an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| to bid with the clerk and master, that will automatically put a piece of property in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| And, you know, tied to that, the more we push this process, the more people understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| hey, I've got to pay my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| You know, and we'll do, we work really well with the city, you know, we'll take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| a property, we'll demo a property if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| We try not to do that, but, I mean, you know, we don't want to take someone's home, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| at the same time, you know, there's a reasonable, they have to pay their taxes, they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| I mean, that's a codes issue, but we will work with the city and our codes people will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| waive liens, we'll do a lot of things to make sure whoever's purchasing these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| can get in them for, and be free and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| Now they won't have a warranty deed, they won't have title warranty, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| they'll, you know, we'll make sure they don't have to pay back taxes or back liens and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| So, I'll make a motion that we recommend approval as per item number three on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=782)|
| 0:13:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| It's been properly moved and seconded that we approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| All those in favor, let me know by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Those opposed, have the same right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Is there any other business before the Insolvency Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| The only other thing I would like to add is not only myself, if there are ever any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| with property, I mean, you can certainly call Hugh if you're comfortable doing so and he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| get it to me, but also Joe Williamson is our property coordinator, one of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| managers that works in the property management warehouse, but his specifically role is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| work through these, so if you can't get me, you know, and there's specific properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| that any of commission wants to, has questions about or wants to add, if you can't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| trustee's office or you have constituents that have questions, just have them call us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| and we'll be happy to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620Insolvency?start=846)|
