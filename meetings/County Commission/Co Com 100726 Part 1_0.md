| 0:00:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| We've got her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| Before we get any further, Chairman Tank Strickland couldn't be here to start the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| He is at a funeral of a close friend of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| And he plans on being here as soon as he can, but it might be a little while before he gets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=74)|
| 0:01:22| So I'm sitting in his spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Do we need to swear you in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| I've been sworn at and sworn in, but hopefully not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| But we're going to go to our next order, which is the devotional by Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| In the Book of Luke, we read where Jesus was looking over Jerusalem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| And as he was looking over Jerusalem, he began to weep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| And he was weeping not because of the buildings, but he was weeping because of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| He had a tremendous compassion and love for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| And so as we gather here today, we should be mindful of the fact that we, too, need to have a heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| and compassion for the people of Knox County as we go about our deliberations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| So if you would, would you bow with me in a word of prayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Heavenly Father, thank you for the opportunity of living in the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| where we are truly a free people and we have an opportunity to gather here to express that freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| through our votes and through our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| And as we go forward in that discussion today, we pray for wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| We pray, too, that our tongues would be civil to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| and that what we say and do would reflect positively on the people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| I also pray today for our troops overseas and for their families who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| and for those personnel that protect us every day, our law enforcement personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| our fire department, our rescue personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| We ask that you bless them and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| So, Father, as we gather in these hours to come again, we just ask for your wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| and we ask that you, again, give us that heart for the people that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| For this we ask in Jesus' name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| And our Pledge of Allegiance today is going to be by Commissioner Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| Join me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:27| All right, do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Thank you, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Two items on your agenda, numbers 905 and 906, I respectfully submit, should be pulled for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| Item 905, dealing with a resolution, deals with your fraud, waste, and abuse hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| And that's going to require the commission to determine whether or not they want to sit as an entire body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| to make certain decisions or to appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| And some of the things that the commission or the committee will have to discuss are the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| the structure, the function, the branding, et cetera, of that hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| And item 906, likewise a resolution, this deals with the audit of the outgoing county mayor's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| and to whom you want that item to be referred, either the internal or external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| Again, that is a decision the commission should make and not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| They'll be taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Yes, I would like to pull, defer 102, the resolution honoring Dr. Walker until next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| to where his family can be here, where it can be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| So we're going to defer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Ordinance 101, I would like to move it to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| A gentleman from the sheriff's department here wants to talk on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Carlton Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| And that's on second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| And Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| I would like to move my discussion item on facilities somewhere around either around public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:13| or four o'clockish or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I've got four special guests that are coming to address that issue on their own time and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| If that's possible, I'd like to at least move it somewhere in that time zone if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Well, hopefully if we can move this along today, we can do that at the end of our regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| and before zoning instead of doing it after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| It would be super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Instead of doing it during public forum, which would just limit them to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I just want to make sure that number 202 is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| 10-7-202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I believe that's because there's no recommendation for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| It probably did not go to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| It wouldn't be on consent if that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I don't see it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Yes, I just want to go ahead and disclose on the resolution R10-7-502 with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:21| with the Knoxville Academy of Medicine and also with CAPA, Project Access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| My husband and I are both members of the academy, and I work a lot with Project Access with CAPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:35| So I don't receive any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| We don't receive any payments for any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| But I just want to disclose it because it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| You're disclosing it, but you're not recusing yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| It would be best if I both disclose and recuse since I'm a former president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| and a participant in CAPA, which we do for free, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| Mr. Law Director, if that item is on consent, can he recuse himself off of just one item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| out of the whole list, or will we need to pull that in order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I mean, the whole idea behind that is to make a public disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| He's done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| He can go forward with any other item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| So, Clerk, if you'll have that noted, that if he votes aye on the consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| he has recused himself of that one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And I would also like to disclose that I work for the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And even though the contract on the agenda is with the College of Social Work, not my college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I think it would be appropriate for me to recuse from that one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Which item was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Anybody see handy the one with the University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you, Mr. Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| We've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=472)|

| 0:08:05| I'm not a youth athletic official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=485)|

| 0:08:14| Mr. Ivan Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Yeah, I'd like to pull item R10-7-101 off the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| and move it up to the front as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| There's about 12 or 14 people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=505)|

| 0:08:41| Mr. Vice Chairman Mike Arnold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| I'd just like to announce that a month from now, our next commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=524)|

| 0:08:55| And since our chairman's not here today, and I hope everyone can keep a secret for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| we want to dedicate that park to the first African-American chairman of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| and make a little surprise for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| So I hope everyone can make it at 1130 a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| Everybody in the room will be held to silence, but we are on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=550)|

| 0:09:25| So that will be a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| And we're scheduled on a Monday to get some federal and government officials from Nashua in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| So that will be right before we make the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=574)|

| 0:10:29| First, let me say thanks to Knox County Commission for their support to the Knox County Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| You all do contribute a lot of money to that, and we do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| If you could, I'd like to have this resolution read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Whereas on May 2nd, May 3rd, and May 5th through May 7th, the members of the SWIFT Water Team from the Knoxville Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| Emergency Rescue Squad traveled to Middle Tennessee to assist the citizens of Davidson and Cheatham Counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| during the massive flooding that occurred in that region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| And whereas these rescuers included the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Ed Kaye, Chris Lawhead, Josh Sanders, Craig Shaver, John Criswell, Armand Mendez, Matt Jenkins, Matt Lawheed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:10| Brian Mize, and K-9 Lexi, Steve London, and Colin Isaacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| And whereas the volunteers rescued persons trapped and overcome by raging waters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| assisted in the evacuation of homes, and searched for missing persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| And whereas one such noteworthy rescue was performed by Matt Jenkins and Armand Mendez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| an elderly couple who had been swept away in their automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| The rapid waters carried the vehicle away and turned it upside down in the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| and the rescuers responded in their boat, broke the windows out of the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| extracted the two victims, and began CPR, and transported them by boat to the awaiting National Fire Department personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| And whereas the selfless efforts of these rescuers resulted in over 200 rescues and evacuations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| of persons from trees, rooftops, and attics, and submerged cars and homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| And whereas each of these individuals committed heroic acts of bravery beyond the call of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| and during times when they are fiscal safety and willing, exposed to danger in order to save the lives of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and applauds the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| for their many efforts in response to the recent flooding in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| We trust that the members of the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| will continue to strive to provide superior emergency rescue services to the Knox County community and all Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=758)|

| 0:12:57| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| I think talking about the rescue squad, you know, it's ironic we're honoring them for something they did in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| I can think back just in the last few years when we had an infant dropped off of a bridge on Christmas Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and the mudslide at the apartment where we had a citizen trapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| and when we had the train derailment in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| They're there every day, any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| And it's just great to honor these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| And, you know, when you look at money that goes to an efficient organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| the number of volunteer hours they put in, it's just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| I think they have one paid executive and just literally hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours over the last term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| So, a great group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| And I know you all honor them very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I'd just like for Chief Cate, if he would maybe introduce the guys that are here, let them do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| He wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=842)|

| 0:14:26| These are the guys that went out and did the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I just kind of was the flunky that coordinated everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| They did all the work and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=872)|

| 0:17:25| On page 15, this is ordinance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Knox County Code, Chapter 12, Article 2, Section 12 through 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| definitions by replacing definition of the term solicitor with a new definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| Ordinance 0-97-5-101, adopted July 28, 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We've got a gentleman who wants to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| If you'll just introduce yourself by name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| My name is Carlton Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I work for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| And we have actually been meeting with the clerk's office over the solicitor and permits portion of our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:24| and had some suggestions about how to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| I found out about this second reading Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| My concern is that by changing the definition of solicitor to what it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| who has no permanent regular place of business in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| at this time you can go to the business tax license office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| provide an address in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| They don't have any ability to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| And you can get a business license for $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| You would then be excluded from the rest of this statute or this code ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| We at the sheriff's office have a large problem during the summertime with door-to-door solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| I need to make one qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| I sold books door-to-door for four summers in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| So I'm not against door-to-door sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| But some of the problems we have are people who don't register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| people who we're not aware of with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Then they'll get inside your house and say, may I use your restroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| And they go into your prescription medicine cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Or they will ask, just kind of look around and, for lack of a better term, case the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| We had wanted to, along with the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| present a number of ideas about how we could make our community safer through this solicitor and peddler's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| In fact, we just met with members of Mr. Arnett's office last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| On Friday, I became aware of, Friday afternoon, I became aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| And I think it's imperative that this county commission be aware that by changing the definition as you propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:18| no regular business in Knox County will be required to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| We have one person who applied through the ordinance the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| And on his application, it showed that he had a theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Further investigation showed that it was a robbery reduced to a theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| We have a number of proposals about making it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| And, candidly, we were going to wait for a new commission to come along because it's a number of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| And we would like a better way of doing background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Right now, the way the ordinance reads is they apply, the permit is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| and then the application comes to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Well, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And I'm merely asking the commission to consider passing this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| so that we can further discuss this matter and make it perhaps a little safer for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I appreciate what he's saying, but I think there has been a misunderstanding in actually what this says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| And I'm going to defer to Joe, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| He's the one who actually wrote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| And it doesn't have quite the effect of what has been implied here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| That's not how Joe wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| And I've asked Joe to elaborate on that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| To begin, this is the first I've heard that there were ongoing issues relative to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| I wish we were included from the beginning since our office is charged with actually drafting a law of this effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| But, nevertheless, this is a narrow part of your code, which deals with peddlers and solicitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| And the way the language is crafted now, it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| it means any person, firm, or corporation who has no permanent regular place of business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| So it does preclude the transient solicitors from coming in with no established regular place of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| Now, there's always going to be an enforcement difficulty there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| I did discuss this with Mr. Arnett, the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| But that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| If there are other issues that the Sheriff's Department wants to raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| I'd love to certainly hear those because they may be something that we can put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| But the way this is drafted, in my opinion, does not now preclude businesses in Knox County from having to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| Additionally, and I understand that there may be some misunderstandings with this on the part of the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:06| but deferring this for 30 days, the people that this is affecting are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| the reason we changed this is because the people who have a physical business address here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| who are Knox County residents and pay Knox County taxes and work and earn money here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| are having to pay a $30 fee to the clerk's office every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| And it puts a financial hardship on someone who's not making a lot of money to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And so by deferring this, we're going to have them pay one more month of that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| Now, I'd like to go ahead and pass this on second reading today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| because it does not have the effect that there's been this misunderstanding about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| And I think it's great that the clerk's office and the Sheriff's Department has some ways to strengthen the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| and I definitely want to undertake that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| But I'd like to go ahead and pass this today and relieve these local business people who are working so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| in the heat out there every day from this unnecessary burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| and then get to work on some stronger language and bring that back as a separate ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| either next month or after the new commission is seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| whichever way the Sheriff's Department would like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I think Joe has been very clear that this does not have the effect that's implied here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| I think Commissioner Burroughs may have underestimated the amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| It's not one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| It's more likely three because we can't defer on second reading because things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| ordinances require two consecutive readings of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| So, in effect, if we don't act on it with second reading today, we have to skip a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| and then we come back and it's like three months down the road before this is finally passed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| Mr. Law Director, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Well, I suspicion what they're going to be suggesting are substantial changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Substantial changes bring you back to a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| So that's going to be the practical effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| You can always come back next month with yet another revision, go on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| but if you want to move forward today, this would preclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| If it came back in the August meeting and there were not any substantial changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| could we vote on it at second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| But if it came back with substantial changes, then you're back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Then we're back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| And it sounds as if, again, this is the first I've heard that these negotiations are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| but it sounds as if there's going to be some substantial changes offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| If I may be heard, Mr. Jarrett, we met for the first time last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| so we weren't trying to do anything behind anybody's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| No, I'm not suggesting that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I'm just saying that normally when it comes down to an ordinance of this effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| it's good if we're there on the ground floor because then we can preclude a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| from being misconstrued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I'm not making any assertions that there was anything nefarious going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| And I'll ask you, does the definition mean that any business in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| does not have to get a solicitor's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| No, it's saying that if a business is established here, has a physical established business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:23| then they don't fall under the auspices of a solicitor in terms of a transient vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| And we have one example, just so commission can be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| we have one example of actually a very good business in town who had an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and it was the robbery example I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I've made my concerns known to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Again, I would say that your concern about the background check isn't even part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| That's a totally separate issue that I agree we need to do some work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| and we should definitely do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| But the concerns that you have, I think Mr. Jarrett has said that this does not mean what you have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| that you think it means and that it's not opening the barn door or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| This is just making it easier on or less expensive for the people who are doing legitimate work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:29| and keeping them from having to give more of their hard-earned dollars to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Is it your opinion, Mr. Jarrett, that they would still have to submit themselves to a background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| The idea is, let's say, friends, let's just arbitrary business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Let's say you have ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| They have a physical presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| They have an office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| They have employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| That's different than a business sweeping them with a van,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| disgorging a bunch of people, sending them through the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| That's the purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| What I'd love to see is your subsequent ideas to further this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| But a local business, a business doing business in Knox County would not have to submit background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| Is that under the way you've written this definition of solicitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| No, I mean background checks, again, that's a separate and distinct issue, and this doesn't cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| They're still going to be required to undergo background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| They're still going to have to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| They're still going to have to have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| What this does is keep them from having to do it every single month, 12 months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| That, we feel like, is an undue burden placed on someone who's working really hard and not making a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| I absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| But the definition of solicitor now does not, under this proposal, does not include a business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| Well, our law director disagrees with you on that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| And he wrote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Okay, I think we all get your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| I have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| If they don't have to do it monthly, do they have to do it annually as far as the background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| You know, I was involved in this in the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| And I think we certainly need to do something where we treat local businesses that are here like the security businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| and, you know, the Domino's pizza people that hang the thing on your doorknob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| You know, I think we definitely need to treat these local folks differently than we do these transient door-to-door salesmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| And I understand that the way the law director has written it and the way I interpret it and, Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| the way you interpret it, that it doesn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| But this gentleman is coming to us with a concern that it may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| And we're saying that it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| And the truth is, we're not the ones who would make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| It would depend on what a judge thought if this was challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| And there's a thing called unintended consequences that happens far too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| We pass a law intending to do one thing, and, in fact, we wind up doing something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| And even though our intentions, you know, are to make things easier for these local businesses to conduct their businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| I don't think it's going to hurt anything to postpone this for 30 days just so we can have another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| You know, the law director has made a call, but he's made a call on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| He hasn't sat down and talked with this gentleman in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| I just don't think it's going to kill us to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| We may wind up next month with a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I sure hope we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| But we also may wind up opening a whole can of worms by passing something in haste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| without examining the possible unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So as much as I'm for this and I'd like to vote for this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| I'm going to make the motion that we postpone this for 30 days so that the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| and this gentleman from the Sheriff's Department can get together and the clerk can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and make sure that we are not opening the door for some very harsh unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| So that's my motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| As much as I support this, I do want to give these guys 30 days to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Mr. Lambert, he has said his concern is that these people won't have to register and undergo background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| Our law director has said that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So I feel like our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Commissioner, if you'll just hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Let me just get a second to the substitute motion, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Do I have a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Okay, I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I will get back to you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Commissioner Burroughs, I've got you back on my list, but we've got other lights on, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Commissioner Lambert, you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Yeah, I mean, I just want to state for the record, I am absolutely for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| It's just out of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I want to give these folks 30 days to get together and have a long and conscious conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I would like to ask my question before I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Commissioner Burroughs, I believe you said local businesses would only have to register once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| How does that apply to people when they register and we run background checks on these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| if they hire more people to do that, if they just register once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I mean, each individual solicitor has to register once a year, pay their fee, and do a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| Each individual person who works for that business has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| And right now what they're having to do is they're having to do it every single month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| the way that the ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| And it's a very hefty financial burden on these people who are working hard and not making a whole lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| And so what this will do is say that they only have to, those individuals who work for a local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| that has a physical established address here in Knox County, they only have to pay that fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| and do their registration and their background check once per year instead of every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| But each person who goes out there as a solicitor has to register, they have to pay their fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| and they have to have a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| What we're saying is that we don't want them to have to do it 12 months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Once a year is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Well, I have a lot of problems with this solicitation in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| There's a lot of women that live there that aren't married and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| And they've called me, and I've had to call the sheriff's department several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| and most of them have been operating me illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| But what I'm trying to say is you're saying the door knocker is the one that has to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| How do we know whether or not he's registered if his business doesn't register once a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| and who they want to have going out for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Well, anyone who is out going door to door has to carry their registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and their identification with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| But if I've got a business and I hire so many people to go out and register to knock doors for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| if they don't register, whose responsibility is that, mine or theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| It's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| And if they don't do it, then they are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And that's what's happening with the people who are preying on the single women and the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| That's exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| They're coming in by the van load from outside of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| and turning these people loose in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| They aren't bothering to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| But our reputable businesses here in Knox County do register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| And their employees do follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| What I'm saying is the business that they're soliciting for should have to register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and give us the name of the employees that they have out going and working for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Now, I don't think we should charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| But they should be required every month to give us the name once they buy this license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and the business should, to give us the names of everyone it's going to be working from that month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| before we can do a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Is that in the law, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Well, yes, sir, you do have that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| But, again, the way your Knox County Code currently reads, that for transient vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| their licenses expire every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| That's a burden you place on people for not having an established business here that we can verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| And the distinction is if you have an established business here in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| you don't have to renew that every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| So an established, physically located business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And the reason for that is obviously because they are easier to monitor, control, and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| That's the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| And I think that your idea is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| I'm sure that the Sheriff's Department has more ideas and suggestions like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| and they wanted to work with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| And I think that's great, and we should move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| But we should go ahead and pass this today on second reading so that we can take this burden off of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| It's not going to have the effect of unregistered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| I mean, it's, this, Mr. Garrett did an excellent job drafting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Oh, I'm not going to, I'm not going to disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I think Joe does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| But there's, you know, there's opinions, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| That's why we have lawyers, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Every lawyer has a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| That's why you have a defense and a prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| They don't agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| But I think we're only delaying this 30 days, according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| If they come back and they get together, the law director, Sheriff's Department, Foster, Arnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| and the clerk all get together, they come back, we can vote on it the first time next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| and then the next month would be the second reading on it and be through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Let's get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Well, I feel like we have gotten it right the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| and that we are placing an undue burden on small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and people who work really hard in the hot sun every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| and we're placing a financial burden on them that we could lift today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| If we don't, it might be 30 days, it might be 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| They may have to continue paying this fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Well, it shouldn't be that long if they do their job and we do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| But the concern, and what we have to look at more is this, than this $15 or $30 it's costing these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| We have to look at the safety of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| That's the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Now, we've had cases where they've gone in and murdered people, they've robbed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| and that's what we really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| And those have not been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Whoever you're working for, let me finish talking, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Whoever these solicitors are working for, as far as I'm concerned, a solicitor is not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| So these businesses should have to report to us, the county, who they're employing this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| to go out and solicitate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Can I interrupt for just a second, Commissioner Pinkson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| I don't know what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Could we write that part into this ordinance without it being considered a substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| or would that be a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I'd have to hear the precise language to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| So, I guess Commissioner Pinkson would desire that the businesses would still need to report in those names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:22| On a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| On a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| If we're changing that the individuals would have to turn in or apply each month, just the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| would that be considered a substantial change and take us back to a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| But I want to make sure that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Does that sound like that would cure it or you're looking for something different, I suspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| Under 1234, it says the permit of peddlers, solicitors, and transient vendors shall expire 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| from the date of issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| There is nothing in your ordinance about a year license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| All licenses right now are issued for 30 days and that's the problem because they're having to repay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| their fee every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| And I understand that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| But there is no provision in this ordinance for a year-long license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| It's a 30-day license and that's the only thing in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| By exempting a Knox County business from being a solicitor, the business, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| does not have to pay the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| But when you exempt them as being a solicitor, there is no provision for a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| The longest permit you can have in your ordinance is 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| There's nothing about a year-long permit in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Mr. Law Director, if, let's say, an employee for a local established business gets a permit to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:55| and solicit, is it in the language of this ordinance that says that they must come back annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| to have a background check and to get a new permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Well, not in this ordinance, but in the laws that the county clerk follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| You know, again, this is a narrow portion, a narrow part of your code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| This particular section is not all-encompassing and doesn't revamp your entire Knox County code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| which is voluminous, nor does it affect the state laws under which the county clerk operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| for the issuance of local business licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| This is just a narrowly defined portion of your code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| So this isn't revising your entire Knox County code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| I just want assurances that if an employee works for a locally established firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| that they would have to, at least on an annual basis, get a permit and have a background check on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| Somewhere within our code, within this ordinance somewhere, I need that assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| Joe, is that in the larger rules that the clerk operates under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| That is my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| So you have that assurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Well, I'm going to go back to Commissioner Pinkston because I was asking on behalf of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| if we could write in there about the businesses still having a report annually, or I mean monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| and so that we could add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| That doesn't place an undue burden on the person who's doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| If that would satisfy Commissioner Pinkston, then I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| But there should be a fine on the business if they catch someone out here soliciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and their name hasn't been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Here's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I've got this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I want to hire some solicitators to go out and knock on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I picked 12 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I don't know anything about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| They come in, I run an ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| They come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| They could have just got out of the penitentiary for murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| They could be psychopaths or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| I hire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| How do I know they're going to go register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I'm just giving them a 1099.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| That's contract labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| How do we know they're going to register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| We need assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| If a business is legitimate in Knoxville, we need to help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| But we need an assurance if they're hiring 10 people to go out and knock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| if they are responsible for the conduct of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| and they should be responsible for making sure these people have a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Well, and I think that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| But, see, we don't have that currently, as the law is currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| And I think that's something that we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| But it's something that we should do as we look at this, look to strengthening this later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| That's why I'm saying 30 days, if they can't do without $30 in 30 days, that's a dollar a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| There's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| And I realize they're hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And $30 to me is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| But our safety of our citizens means more than that $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| And we need to get this right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| We don't need to have any loopholes because we have too many laws right now that have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| So I'm lumpy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I'm glad I second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| This is in reference to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| What about charities and nonprofits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Do they have to have anything special now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| You know, I'll take one that's relatively benign, like people that sell candy bars or calendars for the Farragut band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| There's other groups that come into town, and we've had them knock on our door, that are veterans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| or they're selling magazines or something for some veterans organization that no one's ever heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| that's probably not legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Do they have to have, under the present codes, do they have to have any sort of background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| Do they have to have permits to solicit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| What's the situation with so-called nonprofits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Do they have to register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| You have in your, again, part of your code deals with solicitor for charitable religious purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| And, again, that goes through a litany of requirements, everything from demonstrating their IRS certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| The reason I say that, probably when the Girl Scouts sell cookies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| there's probably not background checks on nine-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And it's the same thing with the high school students, you know, when they're selling calendars or candy bars or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| to raise money for the bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| You know, like I say, we don't have a problem with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| But we have had people come to our house that were absolutely illegitimate, that were there for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| under false pretenses, that were selling magazines or something, you know, quote, for veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| If I may, under your code, everybody is supposed to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| There is, there will be no fee for an application for a permit as a solicitor for charitable purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| I think to accomplish what Commissioner Brolls wants to accomplish is, you just add in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| there will be no fee for an applicant for a permit as a solicitor for charitable purposes or a local business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| And we still are able to do the background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| But by defining solicitor as someone not being from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| you are excluding the Knox County businesses from having to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| And with all respect to Mr. Jarrett, I disagree with what he thinks the result of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| Well, if we could, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Butch, want to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| You know, obviously, you know, when we draft ordinances like this for the commission to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| and it passes law, you know, I don't want to get into a pride and authorship thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| If you've got language, you feel that we can still achieve the desired goal, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| You know, currently our code reads that individuals have to, each applicant has to provide a litany of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| addresses, brief description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| What would your suggestion be to tweak that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Because if it doesn't substantially change it and the commission agrees, we can incorporate it and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| What the sheriff suggested was no fee for a Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| And that even is better than a one-time fee form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| And that takes care of your concern about burdening Knox County businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| But it still gives us the opportunity to be aware of who's out there going door-to-door in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| Well, I think that's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I just want to make sure that we do this today so that we don't make these people who are working so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| have to pay out more of their money to the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| And if you think there's going to be a larger substantial change in the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| why don't you just go ahead and waive the fee today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Vote on that to waive the fee until we get the language hammered down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| Joe, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Yeah, I'm just trying to see how we can do that and achieve, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| when law enforcement raises concerns, I give them a great weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| So I don't want to misunderstand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| And, again, I want to reiterate, I didn't think there was anything nefarious going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| But you raise a concern, I want to make sure we can do that, still achieve the goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| still give the commission a viable ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| I'll tell you what, if we could pass this, if we can just look at some language together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| and then in the meantime the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Why don't we move this to the end of our meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| Yeah, and point of order, I mean, this doesn't look like Robert's Rules of Order to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| People keep interrupting and jumping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| And, you know, you folks jump on me when I get excited and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| And I think we need to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| We need to follow Robert's Rules of Order if that's what we're going to live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Well, right now what we have is a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| We have a substitute motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| So if we're going to adhere strictly to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| we're going to have to deal with that before we can even move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| unless we have a withdrawal of the second so that we can maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| and then a withdrawal of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| And then we can enter or at least withdraw the substitute so we can enter a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| to put this back at the end of the meeting so that the lawyers have a chance to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| up with some wording that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| I think that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Commissioner Lutho, Chairman Lutho,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| could we make amendment to the substitute motion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| No, not unless the maker of the motion and the second agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| There's a second withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| That would be you, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Withdraw it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| So now we can entertain a substitute motion that we send this to the end of this meeting to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Do I hear a substitute on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| We have a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| So all those of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| We've got some lights on, but is everybody okay with sending this to the end of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| I just have one question that I'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| How much money are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| How much is a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I'm not talking about a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I'm talking about on a yearly basis how much revenue because if we're saying that there will be no fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| I'd kind of like to know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Maybe the court clerk's office could tell us because if we're talking about a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| I don't think we are, but I would like that on the table so that we know exactly how much money we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Maybe the clerk or someone could find out information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I didn't get a definitive figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| I was advised that it was not a substantial figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| That's as much as I can advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Maybe we can have the answer to that when we come back to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Any quick other, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Yeah, you know, we get on some of these things sometimes and beat them back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| and beat them to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| It sounds like we're not that far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Now, I would like to ask the question of these two gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Can that be done in 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Well, we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| We will have a break at some point and they'll have a chance to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| I want to know if that's enough time for them to get that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| I propose we waive the fee and that solves the problem as I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| But I'll leave that to Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| If I could answer, 15 minutes would be plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Then I will make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We already have a substitute motion to send this to the end of the meeting, if that's what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| Commissioner Brown, is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| I just wanted to tell Commissioner Hammond that right now each individual pays $30 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| So if you multiply that by 12, that's how much they're paying per year, each individual who's actually out doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| Then it takes how many individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| It's actually 50, but Foster is working on a figure for you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Does everybody understand the motion before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| This is just to send this to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| Someone needs to make a motion to add everything to be added, defer everything to be deferred and withdraw everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3080)|

| 0:58:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| My name is Buzz Thomas, and I'm the president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| I've sold my house in Greenville and I'm moving to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| and do not have a permanent Knox County address yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| I have a home in Maryville where I was born and raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| and that's where I am right now commuting the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Commissioners, I am here to speak on behalf, I think, of your Resolution 7202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| which is a resolution that was passed unanimously by the Knoxville Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| approving proposed change in governance of the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| and its relationship to the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| That resolution, as you'll see from your record, is supported not only unanimously by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| but also unanimously by the Great Schools Partnership Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| which includes Chairman Strickland and both of our mayors, both our city and county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| The impact of the resolution will be to permit the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| to essentially become a freestanding public charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| Right now in IRS parlance, it is a supporting organization of the Knox County School Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| and it is attached at the hip to the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| But as part of the Knox County School Board's strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| they envision cutting the Great Schools Partnership loose as a freestanding charity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| so it could raise private sector funds to begin to support the kind of innovative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| transformational educational programs that this organization has done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| They have incubated a lot of very successful programs here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| But the catch is they have used your money to do it, and the school board wisely wanted to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| So I left my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| I started the Niswonger Foundation, which is an educational foundation in northeast Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| to come back to Knoxville and help them do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| And so the school board, at their last meeting, unanimously approved this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| and I am pleased to report to you that their idea is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| We are trying to raise $8.5 million of private sector funds to help the school board reach its strategic goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| and we have raised more than half of that money in the five or six weeks that we have been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| So we hope, over the course of the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| to raise $3 million or $4 million every year in additional private sector funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| to help our schools become globally competitive as they wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| So I'm here to answer any questions that the commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| As I say, the school board, which is kind of the operative body on the Great Skills Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| has already approved the matter, but all the attorneys involved for both the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| and the Great Skills Partnership felt that it was important that this body also give its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| So I thank you for considering me today and am happy to respond to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you for being here and thank you for the work that you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I guess I'm trying to understand your relationship then with the school board after this change is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Will you be going to the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Will you be working with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Will they have oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| How will this work, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| They will not have oversight and supervisory responsibilities as they used to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| but we will be obligated under our charter to we are only able to spend money on Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| Our mission is to serve as a think tank, incubator, catalyst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:59| and start-up funder for helping the Knox County schools become globally competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| So every nickel of money that we raise will inure to the benefit of the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| We can't go over to Alcoa or Maryville or Oak Ridge and spend the monies we raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| They will be used in partnership with the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| Dr. McIntyre and I have spent the last few months putting together a set of work plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| for the Great Schools Partnership, which will focus on the areas where the school system needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| One that I'm sure many of you all would agree with is early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| We've got way too many kids going into middle school who are not reading on grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| As you know, if they're not reading on grade level, they're usually lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| TAP, the TAP program, there's been a lot of conversation about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| the instructional program for teachers that involves teacher collaboration and coaching and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| And I'm trying to raise a million dollars in private sector funds to help you expand TAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| a middle school intervention and bridge program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| So we'll be raising $900 or so thousand dollars for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| So, Commissioner Hammond, we will no longer be directly supervised by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| which is the point of letting this organization stand on its own two feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| because the school district wants two things out of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| One, they want us to support their schools, and every dollar we raise will be used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And two, they want us to challenge them to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| And I appreciate Dr. McIntyre and the Board of Education's willingness to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| because there's always some risk involved when you ask people to challenge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| But we will challenge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And we have done that, and I think together we are going to be able to make Knox County Schools globally competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| Will you be transparent in your monies raised and monies spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| We will post our budget on a Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| We will, I mean, we will not, we are not a governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| We are not now really a governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| We are a 501C3, but we are attached to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| So we really can't do anything right now without school board's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| But we worked out an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| But let me add one other feature, because when I appeared before the school board last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| they asked one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| They said, Buzz, we don't want you doing things with individual schools that we don't approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:28| You know, we don't want to go through our budgeting process and decide what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| and then have you go out here and raise a bunch of private money and do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| And so we put language that I think you have there in your file in our charter to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| that the Great Schools Partnership will not be authorized to appropriate any monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| if there is an objection by the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| So there will be no money spent by the Great Schools Partnership for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| that the school system does not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| We're going out to raise money for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| So we're going to do it in partnership with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| and make sure that they are involved in every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| But the flip side of it is private funders will not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| and give money typically to governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| That's why the Great Schools Partnership, because it was attached to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| has not been able to raise any significant private funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| They just haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| But in the last few weeks, by just being able to go out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| we're going to be a freestanding 501, we have more than $4 million in private pledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| I think it's going to turn out to be what everybody likes to say, a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| I'm excited about being in the harness with our local school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| And I believe Knox County is poised to have the best school system in the southeastern United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| In terms of big urban school systems, I think Knox County is on a trajectory to have great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| And I would not have left the Niswonger Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| and come down here to start this thing and do this new work if I did not believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| We have $2.4 million budgeted for a Great Schools Partnership in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| It's my understanding that you're going to want to continue that for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Yes, sir, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| What about next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| And, Commissioner, I think what we hope to do, and I'd...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| He's behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Okay, I was trying to find you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| We want, over the course of this year, to begin to hand each of those items over to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:32| so that you can begin to fund them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| We incubated those programs, and they are now successful programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| And I think it's time to hand them off to the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| and sort of get this Great Schools Partnership out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Right now, we're essentially a pass-through for those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| But, yes, we think they are great programs, and I think we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| they've matured to the point where you're ready to put those in the Knox County Schools General Budget for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| but not for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Okay, so, again, the $2.4 million, you're asking to maintain that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| and you'll have oversight over that, but then next year that would be transferred over for these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| And we will hand every nickel of that money over to the Knox County school system for those existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| I'm sorry, Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| I wrote Ivan for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Brother Ivan, my unrelated brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| A quick question here, because that's Commissioner Hammond's last point gets to what I was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| I like your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I even like your idea of becoming a freestanding charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| What I'm concerned is, in that interim year, we are giving $2.4 million of taxpayer money to a freestanding charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| We're picking and choosing among some very good freestanding charities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| and we have trouble with that in every other aspect of our freestanding charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| And that's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| If you were directly transitioning to a freestanding charity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| and not having a transition year where $2.4 million of taxpayer money were going to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| granted intermediary to the schools, but still going through you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| I just wish you had found a way to do a system where you cut off directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| and you didn't have this $2.4 million year where we're giving on the face of it to a freestanding charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| That's what bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| I understand, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Let me try to assuage your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Number one, your chairman and both of our mayors are on my board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| I mean, this is not something that some, you know, suddenly came along organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| This is a community trust that has been attached to the school board ever since its inception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| which was, what, four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| And every nickel of the monies that you are appropriating have always passed through the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| So I can tell you, I hope it doesn't make you nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| I mean, we have a five-year track record of those monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| It would make me less nervous if you just made us a guarantee today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| that you would pass through those $2.4 million funds unencumbered directly to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Well, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I'm happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| With no strings, no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| I'm happy to tell you that the $2.4 million that have been appropriated will continue to fund the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| that the Knox County Schools is already operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| In fact, we are increasing the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| This is a Jerry Maguire speech, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| I'm trying to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| I came here to help the Knox County Schools reach their goals by raising private sector funds to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| If you want me to do that and you, boy, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| And I've got the vision and the energy, I think, to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| I don't want you to be afraid to let us go do it because you have appropriated monies that are going to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| for existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| They are going to go to those existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I give you my word on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| If the pass-through is going through without strings, conditions, or changes from your organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| and I see Dr. McNair nodding that that is what he believes it will be and what he will be receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| and it's his understanding, then I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| But I really want to make sure of those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Mr. Chairman, if I may?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| If you'd just introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Again, my understanding is that, indeed, the funds that were appropriated to the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| will go toward the programs that they've been appropriated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| I have no doubt of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| And, in fact, I'm a trustee on the board of the Great Schools Partnership, as is the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| as is the chair of our school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| And the budget for the Great Schools Partnership for next year is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| The program, the funding, and where it is going to be appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| and where it's going to, what programs it is going to support has been defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| And I have every confidence that that's exactly what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| With those assurances for both of you on the record, that's all I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Commissioner Brown, you had your light on before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| I got my question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Shouse, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| My question was answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| With the Knox Achieve program coming under this umbrella, is that still going to stay separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Right now, it's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| There are conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| They have asked me to serve on their board, and I'm honored to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| In fact, we've already helped Blount County try to do a similar thing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| It's a fantastic idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Right now, they're going to be separate organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| but there are some conversations going on as to whether they might want to come on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and be a part of the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Not right now, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Right now, they're separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Just some questions of technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| If you were a 509.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| That's right, a 509A3 type 2 supporting organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| And you said a moment ago you're now a 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| We won't be a supporting organization any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| We'll be freestanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| When does that take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Or has that already taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Well, it's been approved by the school board, and we want to ask for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| And the lawyers thought that it was wise to get the chancellor to approve this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| since we are a community trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| And everybody that has an interest, including the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| and other local entities that help form the Great Schools Partnership will all get to sign off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| And they have agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| And then we will ask the IRS to change our designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| So my guess, Commissioner, is that assuming we get the approval today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| we hope to be in front of the chancellor within the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| and hopefully have approval by the IRS by the end of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| And I noticed that you also in your statement said that the city mayor, the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| are members of your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| They've supported, but they're going off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| They are going off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| As part of us becoming a more private, well, not private, it's a public charity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:24| but a freestanding public charity that's not under the direct supervision of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| We did not think it was wise to have the CEOs of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| and the city on the Board of Education, I mean on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| But I noticed that the chairman of commission is going to be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| He's still on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| And if you all decide you don't want him on there, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| we just want to be in the best position to help you all achieve your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Mr. Chairman, a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Yes, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I have been advised to ask the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| and the chair if indeed we can defer a mayoral appointment to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| There is a question as to whether or not we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| I've asked Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| I'd like for him to comment on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Commissioners, it's my understanding that the mayor has an appointment to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| He's submitted a name and the commission has deferred that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| I was just looking at your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Generally, what your practice has been, and I can't cite you any black letter law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| because there really isn't any items like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| but generally when it's an appointment other than your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| your job is to ratify unless the person's name who submitted is unqualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| or if, in fact, you don't receive a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| That's been your practice in the past when there is an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| that is not one to be made by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| And that's what you establish in your ordinance in terms of creating the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| But if you look at your commission rules and your charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| it's just nothing that gives you much guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| But just your general practice has been if it's not your appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| and the person's name submitted as qualified, your practice has been to ratify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| And your resolution calls for a ratification of the appointment of this individual, Marvin Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| I guess the question is, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| do we have the jurisdiction to defer for 30 days or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| For just reasons, which has been your practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| In other words, if you look up law or policy, Tennessee Code is not going to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| The charter doesn't address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Your commission rules don't address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| You normally then will have to defer to the culture of your environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| practice, which is you generally ratify those individuals that are submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:06| So it really gets down to your practice than it does the law per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| But the way you establish a resolution, you did allot certain appointments to certain individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| And that's the process you consistently follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| With that said, as we digest that, to my knowledge, and I've done a little bit of research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| I don't think we have a reason or rationale not to appoint this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| I don't know him, but I don't think that we can find cause not to ratify this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:47| I think we're in that uncomfortable spot that we discussed in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| You know, I think this is a, well, it definitely is an uncomfortable spot for us to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| because if we yield to the request of the ethics committee, I do think that opens up a larger question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:13| and a larger can in that, you know, if that's really a justification or rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| new regime coming in, there should be the merit slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| I think we need to look at all those slots if that's the logic that we choose to take in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| And, again, I'm fine with either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Again, we had a lot of discussion on that, but I guess I'll say I think we need to move carefully through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:42| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| In light of this uncomfortable spot that we're in, as my colleague has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| I recall that I was on the prevailing side, so I'm going to bring the motion that we reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| If I remember Robert's rules of order correctly, having voted on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Do I have any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Mr. Pinkson, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Joe, how much longer is this appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| It's until 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| What month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| I don't recall, sir, off the top of my head what month that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Hold on one second, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| October the 31st, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We're talking about a year's appointment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| You know, this is an unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I realize this is a mayor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| But the mayor appointed a man and he resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| Now, we've got another mayor that's going to be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| I don't know whether it's going to be Mr. Mays or Mr. Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| You never know what the voters are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| But we're talking about a mayor that's going to be leaving here in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| making an appointment for these other mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Now, it would have been different if he had made this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| and this guy had stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| But right now, I think, the way the ship is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| I think this brings in the cause and gives us a reason to turn this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| Now, I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| I stand to be corrected because there's nothing in ink that says we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| according to what the law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| But just to appoint someone for 30 days, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| the man's leaving in 30 days for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| And Mr. Hammond may be well the man the next mayor chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| I don't know Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I've never met him, never been introduced to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| But I think this appointment, since we've got 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| should be left up to the new mayor coming in, no matter who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| Commissioner Arms, I mean, Mr. Arms, are you wanting to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Mr. Chairman, before we get further, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| We have before us a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Before further discussion, should we have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Mr. Law Director, since we have a motion to reconsider, does that open up discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| Well, you had a motion and a second, did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| You can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| We can discuss whether or not we want to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| So that's what our discussion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| We're not doing the merits of whether or not we should name a certain person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| but we can discuss the merits of the reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| Mr. Arms, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| And if you'd name an address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Mike Arms, Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| With all due respect, Commissioner, I couldn't disagree with you anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| If your philosophy, the state constitution says the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| and commissioner stay in power until September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| your philosophy would be that eight of you not even be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| You're sworn to do your duty until September 1 until the next mayor comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| I noticed Governor Bredesen made several appointments to the Board of Trustees this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| which is a four-year appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| and that's a big appointment to the Board of Trustees, University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Your philosophy would be let the next governor make those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| The reality of it is this appointment is only a partial appointment because Mr. Edders resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| And if you read why he resigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| then you know why it's important that we not have a vacancy on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:28| So I would be glad for the mayor's appointment to be deferred 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| and let you all have a chance to discuss what obviously needs to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| and that is the reconstitution of this whole ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| And if that you agree to reconstitute it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| I'm sure Mayor Ragsdale would gladly withdraw his nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| He wouldn't want Mr. Hammond to serve for 30 or 40 or 50 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| But the reality of it is if you're not going to have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| this is this mayor's appointment and he's making that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| I really don't have a whole lot to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| You know, you sort of agree with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| If we're going to have a new mayor, it would be nice for him to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| But the fact is that the law reads that the mayor can make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| And we have a mayor now, and it's not like he can make appointments up until 45 days before he leaves offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| or 60 days before he leaves office or 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| I mean, you can pick a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| But the fact is that the letter of the law says that he makes the appointment as long as he's mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| It seems like he would have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I will add that when we talked about it in the ethics committee is that I didn't disagree with the letter that we sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| to the mayor's office, but I also agree with the fact that he has every right to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| I just want to make it clear for anyone who might be asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Marvin Hammond and I are not related at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| And I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| But I have known Marvin for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| He is the executive director of the Hallsdale Powell Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| And I believe he's a fine, upstanding citizen individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| And I know of no reason why he should not be on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| As a matter of fact, I think he'd make an excellent ethics committee person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| But the bigger question is, should we reconstitute this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| I'm in favor of looking at that, but I'm not in favor of looking at it until after September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| So as far as Mr. Marvin Hammond is concerned, I agree with Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| and that is we have a mayor, he's made an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| and this is the person he would like to see on there to serve out this partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| And I don't know that we can turn it down without justifiable reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Elaine Davis, 913 Station View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| I'm currently chair of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| And the reason we had sent this letter to the mayor's office was because we felt like it would be a gracious thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| Obviously, it was a gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| It doesn't say in your rules that you have to immediately ratify that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| It doesn't say when that is supposed to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| The new administration will be decided in probably a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| It's not 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| It's not 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| It's not 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| It's maybe like ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Yeah, but he cannot make that appointment in ten days, even if he wins the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| because he doesn't take office until September the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Absolutely he can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| But I don't think that Knox County government is going to fall apart unless somebody is appointed to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| I think that for 30 days that Knox County government will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| And there are very qualified people that do serve on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| Obviously, it is your decision to ratify that person or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| We have no problem with the person submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| It was just mainly just a recommendation in order for the current administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| to just show some deference to the incoming administration and to be courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| And that was our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| Motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I just said we would be glad to defer this commitment to 30 days and discuss it with the new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| We're going through a great transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I can tell you whoever is elected the next county mayor will agree with this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| And the memo talked about professional courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| I think this committee, ethics committee, is so critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| And, after all, it is charged with the oversight of the entire government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| So I would think out of professional courtesy each member would resign effective August 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:50| and let the new commission of 11 people and the new sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| and the new mayor appoint every single committee out of professional courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| which is what the chairman mentioned in her letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| And that's, you know, if you bring in a new governor, you bring in a new president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| that type of stuff happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| So I would think it would be out of professional courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| a very professional thing to do for every member of that ethics committee to resign effective August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| The motion before us is to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| And that's an election that we're electing Marvin Hammond to the ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| That is the motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Ratifying the mayor's appointment to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| We're back on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| And Tamara Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| If you'll name and address for the record and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Tamara Shepard, 4612 Meredith Road in Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, thank you for allowing me just a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| to reiterate some points made in a letter you got just this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| I think you should find that letter on your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| I distributed it at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Signed by 12 Knox County constituents countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| We are concerned about a recent interpretation from our Knox County Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| that raises grave concerns for the 2012 and the 2014 elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| It came to our attention last week that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| some of our Knox County charter text does appear to allow candidates in district-level races| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:57| to be exempted from a one-year length of residency requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| and possibly even be exempted from any residency whatsoever for a period of up to four years following periodic reapportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:15| As you're aware, that ordinarily happens once every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| Over the ten years between 2001 and 2011, though, we actually will see that happen twice in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| And so our concern is that if we are to, if our charter calls for making this exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:37| and for a term of up to four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| see more than one reapportionment in a ten-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| it appears that Knox County runs the risk of exempting candidates from these residency requirements for more often than not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:56| during any given ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| So the letter we sent you, and we regret that we only had about 24 hours to drum up signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| because I feel like we could surely have gotten many, many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| The letter we've sent you urges you to please, please pick up this issue as soon as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| Presumably, that would be after September 1 when a new commission is seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| And give it your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| I did have one additional point to make, if I could, that we neglected to place in that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| And that is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| And I did want to explain to you, Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| whom I tried to contact over the weekend that I certainly was not approaching you to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| and ask you to introduce an amendment that we hastily crafted over the weekend and introduced just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| I realize that you would want to wait until September 1 to pick up this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| But I did want to bring to your attention that we are looking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| Seven of the 12 of us are in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| And, of course, we understand that you'll be our elected representative effective September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| What I'll do, Tamara, is if you'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Obviously, the law director has this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| If he doesn't, I'll get it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| But your specific questions, make sure that you email me those to, you know, my county account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| Mr. Jarrett and the Election Commission will make sure that we soften through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| make sure that there's nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| But I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Commissioner Anders, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| Now, we didn't presume to rewrite the charter ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| We're simply pointing out the text that requires your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| We'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Just put down your specific questions as to how you see it being wrong or potentially conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| If you'll email me those, I'll get with Mr. Jarrett and we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| You know, there's always been in the charter the waiving of the one-year residency requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:19| And so, but, you know, email us your questions and we'll look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| and see if there's anything that needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| It may just be so circumstantial that it's happened twice that it looks like it's going to be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| But we don't want to create a charter that every time somebody gets upset we go changing the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| You know, and so we've got to be careful of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| and mindful of that there's always going to be a situation that can't be covered by written codified law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| We've got to be careful that we don't try to look at every situation and overcomplex, make it overcomplex to be law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:58| Well, I regret that our letter didn't go out until this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| so obviously you have had virtually no time, maybe no time to take a hard look at our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| But when you do that, when all of you do that, I'll feel sure you understand what the potential risk is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:18| It's a loophole that can and should be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| And we have every reason to be concerned that we could have problems with it in 2012 and 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:30| Okay, we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| I just had a comment to make not pertaining specifically to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| and I'll have to look to some of you people that have been around for a while on when we had the last charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| I believe the charter states that this needs to be done every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| And whenever that eight years is up since the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| this would be an opportunity for us to go through the charter piece by piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| and have citizens and other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| and anyone else who wants to submit things that they would like us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| And this might be an opportunity to look at and correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and consider things that may still be deficiencies or problems in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| And I believe that was the whole purpose of the charter review committee when it was placed in the original charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| is to go back and look at things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| To answer your question, Dr. Briggs, is I believe that within the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| Tamara alluded to the 2004 charter amendment that was on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| And that was actually to change it to get rid of the one-year residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| And it was rejected about by a 60-40 margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| So the people in Knox County have spoken back in 2004 that they want the one-year residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| And I think it's important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| But that came as a result of a charter review committee, which I think was the eight-year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:16| I served in the one back eight years before that in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| And so I think 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| And so the next one would be 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| Now, there was a charter review committee to correct some deficiencies that the court found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:40| when there was a legal challenge to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| But that was not part of the every eight year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| It was just simply an appointment to take a look at it to correct some things that we knew were deficient at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| So 12 would be the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| You know, this is sort of just because of the last charter change that reduced this number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| and changed the way this committee, this board operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:12| it required these two reapportionments, which is an unusual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| So, but to answer your question, 12 would be the next time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Whether or not the commission wants to take a look at it in September or wait until 12, that will be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:30| the next commission can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| You know, I guess the reason I brought that up, that it's an early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| whoever wins this next election will be on the county commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| If we started early in 2012, that would give us the opportunity to put those on the ballot in the November election in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| to get those changes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| And then the next commission election would be, you know, would be in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| So these would, if any of these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| and I'm not referring to this but any other changes that occurred that would have those corrections made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| I'm not going to say corrections like there's something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| but that would have those changes made that would be applicable to the 2014 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Well, here again, if the commission decides to put something before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| they obviously can vote to put an item on as a charter change by two-thirds votes twice for a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:33| And put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Of course, that wouldn't happen until 12 anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| Yeah, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| So you could wait and allow that body that's appointed to the charter review, which has to happen in 12, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:46| And that way you've got citizens in the makeup, you know, making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| Do we have anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Next is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| There are a couple of things you all have on your agenda that I had some interest in speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| but I thought it would be most appropriate from public forum because it covered a few different topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| having to do with whistleblowing and the Pam Reeves report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| I guess about a year ago I filed an ouster suit against Bill Lockett, Bruce Weitrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| and Tom Salter because I was concerned over how they were performing their duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| and issues involving those individuals within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| That suit was dismissed for lack of standing, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:51| Since that time, Pam Reeves has issued a very lengthy report that basically expresses the exact same concerns that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| in that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| The county commission has also expressed concerns over her findings in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| You all have passed, as I'm sure you're aware, a resolution asking for definitions for a fireable offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:18| One of the three individuals has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| And you all have also asked for the next mayor to restructure and read the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| and take appropriate actions against the people named therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| However, when I filed the ouster suit, the individuals involved had an attorney hired for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:44| an outside legal attorney, and to represent them in defending the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| Currently, it is my understanding that this attorney is suing me for the legal expenses that you all have paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| keeping these people in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| You basically paid an attorney to keep these people in office, Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| On the other hand, Knox County is passing resolutions asking for something to be done about these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| And I'm just kind of making you aware of what really happens with a whistleblower with the status quo, how things are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:25| You can find some serious concerns, bring them to the attention of the current administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and absolutely nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Ms. Reeves can find serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| This commission can find serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| You can pass resolutions asking for something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| As of yet, I'm not aware of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| But if a private citizen files a litigation to make something happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| you will be countersued for attorney's fees from this very same county who's been passing resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| asking for something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| And I thought you all ought to be aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| and what a great whistleblower protection program the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| I see that Mr. Jarrett has stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I think he's working on that other feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| Yeah, I just wondered what the status was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| I know, I mean, the county does have an obligation to protect their employees when there is a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| First of all, can you ouster someone who's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| No, ouster suits are for elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| In terms of the whistleblower ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| the whistleblower amendment to your ethics code is to protect the county employee from retribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| or retaliation from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| So if an employee comes to my office and they say they work in, this is arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| they work in purchasing or procurement, and they say, here's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| You know, my supervisor is involved in nefarious activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| I said, fine, we investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| The supervisor finds out, fires him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| That person is protected under federal, state, and county whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| But the whistleblower statute is designed to protect the county employee from retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| The ordinance amendment or the amendment to the Knox County ethics code that's on your commission agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:24| or rather I should say your audit hotline, is to afford private citizens the opportunity to call in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| and report nefarious activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| And, again, federal and state law protect those individuals from retaliation from the person so reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:40| You know, I guess my other question is, are you aware that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| and I know that attorneys have the right to collect attorney's fees, you know, when they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:52| when they're defending someone and the judge rules in their favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| Are these fees against Mr. Mays being collected on behalf of the county, or what is the status on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:03| Since we had an outside contract attorney do this, are they now counter-suing for attorney's fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| that go back to Knox County, or what's the status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| It's my understanding that an employee has sued Mr. Mays, but we're certainly not handling that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| I believe he's retained a private attorney to do that for, I think the allegations are comments made by Mr. Mays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| but we're not involved in that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I really haven't gotten involved in the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| and certainly haven't given counsel to the employee who's essentially sued Mr. Mays in his individual capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:42| Now, when the county gets sued, you know, first we do to see if it's a valid lawsuit as compared to a frivolous lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| If we feel a private citizen is suing the county and the lawsuit is frivolous, we will certainly, you know, defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:57| But again, the threshold inquiry is whether or not allegations made are mere allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| or there's some substance to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| But, you know, your charter and everything else, the county is a body politic that deserves a defense if sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| No, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| You know, getting back to what Brad said, is this suit for the attorney's fees that you're talking about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:23| is that being done on behalf of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| The current litigation I'm speaking of is completely irrelevant to the private litigation filed by Mr. Salter in his individual capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:37| This litigation is for the ouster attorney's fees that I basically filed an ouster against these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:46| The law director's office hired an outside attorney to represent those individuals to defend them in the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| Those would be Mr. Lockett, Mr. Salter, and Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| That attorney is now coming after me for attorney's fees and defending these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| And my position is it couldn't have been frivolous when your own attorney, Pam Reeves, finds concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:11| and one of the three people has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Well, you know, not getting back to the merits of that, I'm just trying to determine who is suing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| You know, first of all, who defended the two people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| And they need to be defended, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| I don't disagree with that when they're county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| But who, you know, who is collecting fees now on behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| The client would be Mr. Weitrick and Mr. Salter for the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| The attorney is being paid by Knox County to litigate against me to recover attorney's fees to pay to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| to defend them in an ouster suit to protect their jobs and keep them employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| The litigation is something that's an old litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| And basically, the litigation was dismissed with the right to refile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| However, at the time, the Reeves report had not been released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| Let me stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Let me stop right there and say all I'm trying to determine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| My personal opinion is it's vengefulness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| That's not what I'm trying to determine either, is that did Knox County outsource the legal defense of those two employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:27| where basically Knox County is paying to defend them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| And I don't disagree with that because they deserve to have an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Is that correct or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Do you know, Mr. Jerry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| This is the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| First of all, Mr. Mays has signed on to several lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| So I think at least three of that were his attorney is Herbert Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| The problem is, Commissioners, first of all, this is ongoing litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Second of all, if a private citizen sues the law director, in this case he sued Mr. Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| Mr. Lockett can't defend the suit himself and he can't assign it to an attorney because it's a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| and the law won't provide for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| But the problem is I can't really comment on pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| This gentleman is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| I mean, he has an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| And his attorney then has a right to then go to the Board of Professional Responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| and basically file a grievance because I'm engaging in banter outside the presence of the court on ongoing litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| But, you know, Mr. Mays, it appears, is presuming that his facts are correct, he should prevail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| and he's being penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| You know, obviously the county sees it in a different light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And, again, you may not, by law, oust appointed officials through an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| That is a frivolous lawsuit because that's not the remedy provided by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| The ouster suit is designed to oust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| or remove elected officials who have created one of several numerable offenses like moral turpitude, public drunkenness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| public gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| It is not designed for a private citizen to start coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| and getting county employees fired because they're in conflict of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| You know, I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| I think I'm not articulating my question very well is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Is did we outsource the defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| And I understand why we would have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Do we outsource the defense of the two county employees to an outside law firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| And I'm talking only, only about the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| And I'm not talking about whether you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I'm not talking about the merits or whether you can do it or not, but we outsource that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Well, there are several pending litigation matters that arose last year that we did not handle in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:43| because of conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| But if a county, it's just like when a sheriff's deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| if a sheriff's deputy sued in their professional and individual capacity, you can't defend both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| So it requires us by law to get outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| But, yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| But, see, really all I'm trying to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| May I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| All you're wanting to know is, is Knox County paying for Bruce Wheatridge and Tom Salter's law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:13| Well, really what I'm trying to find out is that through a proxy is Knox County suing Brad Mays to get the law fees back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:22| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| I misunderstood you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| And I don't disagree one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| I understand exactly that when there is a suit like this, it has to be outsourced because of conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| But also if it's outsourced and now we're suing to collect legal fees, is that being done on behalf of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| And I'm not talking about all these other suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| I'm talking about the ouster suit period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| That's really what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Can you answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Or is this private attorneys suing on behalf of private individuals to get the attorney's fees back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| That's all I'm talking about, not whether it's right or wrong or who won or who lost or any pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| It's just, you know, who is suing who on behalf of who, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| I'd have to know what specific case to which he's referring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| You're talking about the case where he filed ouster suits against the two employees and Bill Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| Is that the question, Commissioner, whether or not we're pursuing to recoup the fees that the county had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| expend in defending a frivolous lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Yes, just that one on the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| I suspicion we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| I'd have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| We've got about 300 active litigation files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| I tell you what we could do just to save time is that maybe we can bring this up at the next commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| because legal things drag out so long and I just was wondering the status of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| My only point was I just wanted to bring it to everybody's attention what happens to a whistleblower in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| I think it's about break time and the two attorneys can get together on the previous issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| I think, actually, they're ready to move on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| So we can either get to it now or wait like we voted to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| So we know we're still on this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| So if you don't mind, I'm going to go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| He had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Brad or Hubert, either one doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| If you can tell us any comment you want to make on the Pam Reeves report, we're going to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| We'll talk about that a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| And number two, you know, we've been dealing with this probably three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| Tell us where you are in your best judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| I know you're not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| You don't know what the court system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| But where, I don't know how many lawsuits that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| I don't know what all that you've got going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| But tell us in a nutshell, when do you think we're going to have some closure on certain things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| Do you have one lawsuit, two, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| But tell us your best judgment where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Then I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I'm hoping to get the revenue sharing litigation into court the latter part of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| Now, explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| That is where Natural Resources Recovery failed to pay you the revenue sharing fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| There's another case involved with that that we hope to have into court later on this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| and that has to do with some double invoicing or some grinding bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| That will be into court hopefully the latter part of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| And that's the zoo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| That is for grinding material that they'd already been paid to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| There is another litigation that we'll probably be hitting, we hope, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| but maybe next, first of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| We're not sure on a trial date, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| That involved billing for several loads of zoo manure that did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| The other litigations, the action Mr. Salter has filed against me and the counteraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| those are on a personal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| We have deposed Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| That is in process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| We did get some interesting admissions that I'm not going to comment on, though, from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:21| And the other litigation had to do with an ouster suit that I'd filed against Bill Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| an elected official, along with two people within county government to oust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:35| One of the individuals subsequently resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| The other two, there is a 50-something page long Pam Reeves report concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:46| And that is the one that I was speaking about today where the county has basically commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:55| and asked for Mr. Lockett's resignation, commissioned and asked for disciplinary actions to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| against people involved in the Pam Reeves report, but then turned around and told me, counties told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:10| you need to pay these legal fees because you have no basis for this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| which totally contradicts what commission has been saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| And I thought that it had merit considering Mr. Lockett was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| and there's other language in the law that I feel is disputable on the fileability against ouster of Mr. Weitrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| and Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| So that's the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| It's yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| That section was not ruled upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| That's five lawsuits I've got right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| Yeah, there's a lot of litigation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| I never thought I'd be involved with something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| I just thought, here's somebody that owes the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| I can't make the mayor collect the money, so I would go do it on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Here we are three years later and there's probably more legal action that I'm not fully informed about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:58| But here we are three years later and nothing's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| Any report on the Pam Reeves report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| Well, I do think that Ms. Reeves may have been given as bad as that report reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| And anybody who's read it knows how horrendous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| There is some information in there that I believe she was given some false and erroneous information by some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| involved, and we'll cover that when I get certain individuals under oath the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| But there's some information in there that I believe she was misled on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| But it does go to show the recklessness that's been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| That contaminated material was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| The public wasn't warned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Hundreds of thousands of dollars of tax money was being thrown out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| And if you really follow it and read into the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| what you're going to figure out is the one person who benefited every time was this outside contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| They benefited from it financially to a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| And they did it on the backs of the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Next on the list is Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Grant Rosenberg, Director of Neighborhoods and Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| I just wanted to give you an update on an item that you all voted on back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| You instructed our office to pursue a request for proposals for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| and operations of a public safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| Well, we submitted the RFP on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| The bid opened last Thursday, and we received one proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| And I would like to propose to you all to schedule a commission workshop to review this specific proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| I'll be e-mailing it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| It's a rather large PDF file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| I'll be e-mailing it to you this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| And if we could schedule something perhaps after finance or intergovernmental in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| I think after intergovernmental would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| Brad will chair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| We tend to do it on Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| I thought maybe Tuesday would be a change of pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| But we'll decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| Yeah, we can do it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| Did we have a request for a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| Is that what Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| The first thing after break, did Commissioner Armstrong ask for a discussion of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| We were going to hear that after we heard everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| But prior to going into hopefully be we get everything else done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| and we have time to listen to that before we go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7074)|
| 1:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7117)|

| 2:10:12| If the commissioners could have their seat, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:32| Okay, clerk, I think we'll go back to Ordinance 101 on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:55| If you could read that back into the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| This is on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:20| Okay, we've already heard the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Mr. Law Director, have you had a chance to come up with some little different wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| I have, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| I believe it was Mark Twain who once said, my town is too small for a lawyer, but it's certainly big enough for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| But that being the case, Mr. Carlton and I have looked over the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| We've looked over the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| We've read them in power of material, in other words, in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| This is what we would propose, and I gave the clerk a copy, and I've also shared with Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| The definition of solicitor will be modified somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| I do not believe it is a substantial change, and I believe you can go forward on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| And likewise, you do have the opportunity to further refine the ordinance at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| This is what the definition we've agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| Solicitor means any person, firm, or corporation who goes from dwelling to dwelling, business to business, place to place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| or from street to street, taking or attempting to take orders for any goods, wares, or merchandise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| or personal property of any nature, whatever, for future delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| except that the term shall not include solicitors for charitable and religious purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| and solicitors for subscriptions as those terms are defined below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| Knox County businesses that have an established physical location in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| are exempt from the permit fees required by Section 12.29b of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| So what that does, it really doesn't change your definition of solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| It still has the same force and effect, but it does exclude from the fee requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| which I believe was the preponderant concern, an established physically located Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7976)|
| 2:13:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And you're fine with that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| Mr. Law Director, we passed sending this on to later in a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| but we did have an original motion to approve as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| Was that white clear when we voted earlier, or would a motion right now be considered a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| I believe you can move forward because, again, you're not changing the original intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| and that being the case, I think you can proceed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| All we need is the original maker of the motion to accept that language of that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| That is correct, and I've given a copy to the clerk for their records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| Does the maker of the motion agree with that as an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| In the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| You can't agree to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| Saunders and Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Saunders and Wright, do you agree with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| And I just would like to say that I am very, very much appreciative of everybody getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:16| and working this out so that we could get this done today for these small business people and small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:25| I really do appreciate it, and I love to see it when everybody is working together and gets it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| The court clerk was looking at a fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| I was wondering what the fiscal impact is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| About $3,000 last year is what Mr. Arnett told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| Now, again, I think he was looking at all solicitation, but I think it would be even less for those entities that are actually established here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8084)|
| 2:14:53| And, again, that's a sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| It depends on how many people come forward the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| Commissioner Hammond, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8106)|

| 2:17:18| I just reiterate that I will be recusing and abstaining because I am associated with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| And just let the record reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| It says 100 chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| We have $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Are there other people working with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| That seems like a lot for 100 people and you've got two part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| Are there other people working with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Commissioner Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Neighborhoods Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| Janet Drumheller is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| She's here on behalf of the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| Jenny Weatherstone was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| However, she couldn't stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| She had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| She had an appointment at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| But I think Janet can speak to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| Janet Drumheller, 5006 Cloverdale Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| I'm the Reference Services Manager at the Knox County Public Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| and I've been the liaison to Volunteer Ministry Center with this program, which is not brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| The VMC was kind enough to provide us some outreach caseworkers a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| but their grant money at that point dried up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| This is not case management, meaning that they are meeting at the library with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| This is case management in that they are approaching people at the library who might be spending the whole day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| instead of using library material, and trying to engage them in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| So they may meet with a person once and they get them to go to VMC instead of the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| It's a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| When we had it before, everyone is entitled to use the public library, including homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| But you don't want people who just are coming in for an air-conditioned room to spend the entire day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| We don't have space for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| And these people engage them in services and get them redirected to where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| which is CARM or VMC or mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| The story our caseworker we had before told me was one of her very first people she approached said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| I just got off the Greyhound bus and I didn't know where to go except the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| So she directed that person to CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| And as I say, everyone is welcome to use the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| but the folks that want to just come and sit all day need to be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| And these folks are trying to enable that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| Well, we'll see if we have any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Are you done, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| Thank you, Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| I use the library three or four days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| and I think Dr. Briggs mentioned this at our finance meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| I'm not saying this critically, but you touched on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| In hot weather and you go to the library in January, February, it's 20 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| I think the population surges of homeless and people wandering around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| and coming in to get cool or warm, use the restroom and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| Obviously, they're citizens and have a right to the library like anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| It is somewhat of a discouragement, I think, to I've heard just from constituents to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| well, my kids are sort of afraid of the homeless guys in there and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:22| just repeating what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| And this question was asked last Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| Is this an encouragement to, hey, let's go to the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| we'll find some caseworkers that will help us for food or clothing or a place to spend the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| or is it a discouragement or is it a neutral from that perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| Larry Frank, library director, it's a discouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| What we're doing is breaking the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| Our experience has been once these caseworkers approach the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| they're able to channel that energy in a very positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| And what we discovered the last time is that when the homeless came in and saw the caseworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| some went in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| And when you're homeless, you like anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| We don't give them anonymity with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| We get involvement, engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| When they're engaged, they step back, and we channel that energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| Let me tell you about one experience that I had with the first caseworker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| We had a gentleman stand out on the porch every morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| and finally I started talking to him to find out what happened, why he was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| And he had driven in a car from Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| He had lost his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| And come to find out, he had his bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in Champaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| was a teacher, lost his family, became an alcoholic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| drove until the gas ran out of his car, and was in the streets for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| The caseworker worked with him, got him straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| He's not back in the library, but he's in an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| He's working and occasionally stops by to check out materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| So what we're trying to do in a very humane fashion is break that cycle of the people that use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| because there's a lot of people that use the library, too, that are veterans and have emotional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:20| So, again, we're trying to break that cycle and do something very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| And this offers the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| Yeah, this came up, and I know I called you about this the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| If this were good or bad, it's the same thing that I mentioned that Commissioner Shouse was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:41| I, like you, go to the main library very frequently, at least once or twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| And I know in the past, before your tenure as library director, you would go back into the bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| and there'd be some guy standing in there naked taking a bath in the sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| You would go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| You couldn't find a place to sit because all the homeless people were there with their packs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| And, you know, even recently, sometimes I come by early in the morning at a quarter till six or so to drop books off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:11| And what I didn't want to have happen, and you've assured me that this actually takes care of this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| is for the public library to become another homeless counseling center that serves as a magnet for some of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:26| Because, you know, I do enjoy going to the main library a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| and sometimes it is a little disconcerting to find somebody unclothed in the bathroom, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| And we've had a positive response with the caseworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| Like I said, the homeless seek anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| They don't seek recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| So we have addressed that, and this addresses that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| And so we feel very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Other libraries have looked at what we've done in the previous years and borrowed ideas from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| We even have, in terms of bags, we incorporated what the airline industry does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| that it can only be a certain size when you enter the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| It has to fit in a compartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| We're doing a lot of little things and have done to channel that energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| Plus, we have outreach into the homeless area in terms of donations of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| So we're redirecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| We're redirecting it, and it's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| We're getting a lot of people looking at us from other cities to see how we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:32| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I leaned in the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| I just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Franks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| And the Lightyear Library staff, you all are incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| And I think that this is a really great program, and I'm so glad that you support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8702)|

| 2:25:43| I think, Commissioner Mark Carman, you needed to recuse yourself from this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| On this one, and the clerks have already been told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| Yes, but we'll announce that you recused yourself on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8752)|

| 2:26:01| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| approving the FY 2010-2011 defined service memorandum of understanding with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| and mandating the fines assessed against Nassau County beer permit owners by the Nassau County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| be used exclusively to support the activities of the Metropolitan Drug Commission Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Eight-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Recommend for approval of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| And what that substitute motion states is that we recommend that they receive full funding of $20,000 out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| Are you making that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| I just want to make a disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:54| I am on that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| I've received no remuneration, and I don't see a conflict in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Yes, I was going to ask Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| They gave us a report, I believe, that said this resulted in $10,000 to $15,000 here in fines and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:12| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| I guess I don't know if the law director remembers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| It ended up being something like $16,000 one year, but the other years were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| That's like we haven't even corrected anything this year at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| And 2008 was something pretty minuscule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| If I recall, Commissioner McKenzie, I remember it was three years ago, it was like $2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| and then the next year it was $2,500, and then for some reason it jumped to $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| And then this year, well, it's been $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Here's another thing that I'm concerned about, too, is when we were talking about giving them this instead of the $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:52| I believe you were talking about taking out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| We were concerned about how this was going to, where it was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| Is it going to go in salaries or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| How are we going to use this $20,000 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| And, again, I'm sure this young lady will speak to that, but they ended up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| and Grant may want to speak to it as well, they had $20,000 worth of funding to fund their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| The process, the budgetary process, slashed their funding by a factor of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| All this is going to be doing is restoring it, which I think was Commissioner Brown's original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:30| With the resolution that's presented, there's no way we could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| doesn't look like we're going to meet that milestone this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| so that they would have gotten our $1,500, whatever, maybe a double, you know, before December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:44| So they would be operating at a deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| The whole point of this is to give them back their original funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| Do you feel that this is a stable way to do it and something that they can expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| Well, Mr. Chairman, as the sponsor of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| this kind of all got kind of blown out of proportion and whatnot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:07| The idea was to reinstate at least part of the cut that they had taken in their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:16| We did put a cap on it of $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| It didn't make it into this, but there was an original cap on it of $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| which would have made them back their $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| At the intergovernmental meeting, the idea that came up was just let them give them back their full funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:35| If you're going to do that, then that has to be, to me, that can't be part of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| It has to be a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| No, the motion on the floor is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| So your motion as written is not on the floor for consideration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:51| No, no, no, let me correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| The motion on the floor is the amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| Here it says substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| Well, it's an original motion, but it's an amended resolution, if that makes sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:08| You've amended the original, but you made the first motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| So we don't have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| All we have is one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| It made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| That was where the resolution has been changed from the original, what was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Just so everybody is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Mr. Chairman, may I suggest, saying it even more clearly, we're considering it as passed by intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| It says to be used exclusively to support the activities of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:41| In finance, we were very much concerned, is any of this money going to be used in salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| It was supposed to be for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| That's what I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| We moved it up from $10,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| Is this money going to be used to pay anyone's salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| My name is Heather Sutton with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| I'm here today representing for Karen Pershing, our executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| She is in Phoenix this week at a conference, so I'll be speaking on her behalf to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| We're very heavily grant funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| We receive a $100,000 federal grant in which we have to match at 150%, meaning that we are providing $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9077)|
| 2:31:27| both direct and indirect donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| And so, as you may know, every penny is critical to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| And this money will be used for our prevention and education efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| We work very closely with on and off premise businesses to provide them with tips and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:48| and materials to continue to keep them in compliance to educate the public about the underage drinking laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9108)|
| 2:31:58| We also provide drug free workplace trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| which we provide to any business that requests it to educate their employees about the underage drinking laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:11| And that's in addition to many other things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| We work very closely with the school system to target and educate the high risk population youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:24| particularly Fulton High School and Richard Yoakley Alternative School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| And we also staff a coalition of, well not staff, but we support a coalition of over 70 collaborating agencies to further our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:39| And so, yes, to answer your question, this would be money used to educate the public about substance abuse issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:47| And, you know, this would not be a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:53| Now, is this a 5013C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Do we have the salaries listed as the top two people like we're supposed to have when we give money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Have you all submitted that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| You know, I'm not positive about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Mr. Pinkston, they did go through the normal channels of asking for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:12| I'm sure it was given back at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| I think that was part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| I know they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| I just wondered if they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| I'm not aware of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| I don't think they would have gotten the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| I just wanted to disclose that I am a board member of the Metropolitan Drug Commission Board, and that's why my lot was on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:38| I don't receive any monies or anything from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| It's strictly a volunteer board and a board that's very well staffed with staff that their main goal is to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:54| and help provide younger students in the high school, very active with the Youth Action Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| the ones that you saw out here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Metropolitan Drug Commission works very closely with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| Our board is staffed with a lot of people with a lot of credentials that believe in this Metropolitan Drug Commission Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:19| So this is all about educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| Our main thing is to educate, and that was the main reason why I wanted to be a part of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| is to educate the younger children on the dangers of the drug abuse and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| So I just want to disclose that I was a member of it, and I don't receive anything from it, and I very much support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| I really want to support this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| I think that what you guys do is very valuable work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| but I would like to hear from John Troyer on this because we're about to allocate $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:59| and I just want to make sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| Only ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| It's an additional ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| An additional $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| I just want to make sure that, I mean, I've got a lot of faith in John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| He's a real wizard, and I just want to make sure he can pull another ten grand out of his magic hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| Go ahead, wizard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:18| John, if you'll just identify yourself for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| John Troyer, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| You know, this is, there's no magic hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| But I think I would certainly defer to the Commission's wisdom about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| I think we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| You believe our budget can withstand the $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| You're saying you can find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| John, have you got the figures yet on how our budget was for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| We still, books are open, so we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| I just want to remind everybody, we haven't been meeting, our revenues have been less than our expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| and this $10,000 we're giving comes out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| Now, I want this Commission to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| I have to keep saying that because I'm leaving up here and nobody else will say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| So, I just want to make sure to restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| We're going to fully fund them this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| The $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| Are they still going to collect the fines this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| Well, the way it works is that the fines go into the general fund right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| The general fund pays this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| So, it's coming in one and then going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| It's just a matter of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| We're going to fully fund them no matter what the fines are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| And I guess to answer your question, if we end up getting $3,000, they're not going to get $23,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| They're just going to get $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| Commissioner Brown, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| Do you get any money from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| Yes, we get money from city and county, although I'm not aware of the exact figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| Would you say it's about the same as you get from the county, $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| You know, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| I'm not positive on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| What do you do in the middle schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| You mentioned the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| Can you tell us the programs you have in the middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| We're currently working right now to pilot a program in the middle schools called Planet RX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:18| which is an Internet scavenger hunt that will educate students about substance abuse issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:25| We also work with Richard Yokeley Alternative School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| which 60 percent of the students at Richard Yokeley Alternative School are there for drug or alcohol-related offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:37| And so we have our coalition volunteers that are there helping to mentor these students with their reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:47| with providing them with alternative options, and to provide them with incentives for good behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:55| And we also have a youth group at Fulton High School, formerly called PRIDE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| but is now called the Youth Above the Influence Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| that has a similar function in that they support alternative activities for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:12| which will help them avoid drug and alcohol use after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| I think the latest survey that I saw that you all did in the Knox County schools, you had someone as young as 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| maybe the average age was maybe 11, that they were starting to experiment with drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| Do you see a need to start going into elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| As far as I know, we haven't been exploring elementary schools at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| but studies are indicating that the younger crowd are becoming more adept to taking drugs and consuming alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9517)|
| 2:38:47| so that would be a potential consideration for us in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| I want to raise two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| One out of the finance committee was my concern in voting against this, but it's divorced from this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:10| In that, I do not like the policy being adopted whereby we say if something happens, then the money goes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:20| It's like an earmark thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| That particular process, it's not related to the drug issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| It's a process I would like to see us avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| In other words, we need to fund something if we would like to see it occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| So let me say first, I voted against this not because of the Metropolitan Drug Commission or anything related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9578)|
| 2:39:45| I voted against it because it was saying if we collected fine money, money in the form of fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:53| we were going to send it on to this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| I believe the money received from fines or whatever money is received by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:04| probably needs to go in the general fund from which we establish a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| That brings me to my second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| When I look at page 719 of today's PDF, it says at the top of the page that this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:23| and I believe it's already been addressed, but I just want to make a point of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| It says funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| So actually we're saying that we are moving money around in the current budget to meet this $10,000 extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:38| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| As the resolution was originally drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| it was going to be money collected by the current beer board fines throughout the rest of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| So let me go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| But for just a second, that's washed out of the motion that we have on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| There is no connection between beer board fines and this allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| And real quick, let me back up to the intent of using beer board fines to supplement the current defined service contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:12| that was voted on back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| I think the thought was since the Metropolitan Drug Commission works so closely with the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| who are in violation, it just kind of made sense to have those dollars go directly towards prevention, outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| education associated with underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| And that was the intent behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| Now, I don't disagree with any of the remarks you just said, but I wanted to explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| because I had talked to Commissioner Brown about this earlier, and that's kind of where this thought process came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| And just to back over that one more time, I in the future will not look favorable upon something coming saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:52| if we do this, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| All the incoming revenue stream of Knox County is probably toward the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| But then the second point, is this new money or is this moving around money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:10| As it's currently, as the amendment's been made, that would be, yeah, reallocating some money in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| We'd have to find an extra $10,000 to fund the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| And I'm in favor of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| This sounded so simple in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Like a lot of other things, the more we stir the pot, the thicker the broth gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| When Grant and I first talked about this, our concern was the fact that, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| we've had a committee we haven't met in the last couple, three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| but working on ways that we can keep drugs and alcohol away from the teenagers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9765)|
| 2:42:53| With the city folks, with the Metropolitan Drug Commission, and several other entities on this particular subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9773)|
| 2:43:03| Since their budget was cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| this was a way that we figured that we could add some money back into the budget of the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:17| to try to continue these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| My concern was that if we go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| now we're going to readjust an item on the budget and fully fund one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9803)|
| 2:43:31| then who's to say next month that XYZ is going to come up and say, well, you know, I got cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| How about giving me the rest of mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| This was not a way around that, but it was a way to accomplish the objective, which he and I had set out to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:51| Now it's been changed to the point, I mean, the whole thing that's written here in our schedule today is totally off the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9831)|
| 2:44:01| and off the record, and we're down to simply reinstating their full $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9841)|
| 2:44:08| We're not giving them $20,000 extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| We're only adding $10,000 over what was approved in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| So that's my concern is we get that money in there to continue this education because it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| Commissioner Bross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| I just wanted to say that I hope you will consider going into the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726part1?start=9870)|
