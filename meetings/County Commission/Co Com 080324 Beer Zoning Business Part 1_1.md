| 2:48:17| Yes, I'd like to introduce Reverend David Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| pastor of Norwood United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| which is also a chaplain for Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10102)|
| 2:48:26| He wanted to see if everybody wanted to hold hands while we prayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| but I was afraid the unit might rub off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| so I don't think he's going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| Gracious God, we thank you for this day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| a day in which we know that you are with us through your presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| through your Holy Spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| God, as the county commission comes together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:50| as elected officials are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| may we always remember the purpose that we were elected or appointed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| that was to serve Knox County to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| God, may we lay aside personal differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| May we do so the task before us with integrity and honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10147)|
| 2:49:15| And may you bless our efforts as we seek to do what is right in your side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:23| and in the side of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| God, we pray that you would give us the wisdom to know what that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10167)|
| 2:49:36| and that through your Holy Spirit we would be led.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| We make this prayer in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10184)|

| 2:49:48| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=10188)|
