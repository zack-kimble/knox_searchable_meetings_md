| 0:10:06| This started out because we just wanted to clean up the facade of Hollis High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and make it look nice after 55 years of not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And as we got into it, we found that there was some deterioration in some of the aggregate concrete that had been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| and there was deterioration in some stucco that we couldn't easily repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=626)|

| 0:10:40| we're going to replace all the windows in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=640)|

| 0:14:46| Consideration of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=887)|

| 0:15:00| This is ordinance number 0-90-9-130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=900)|

| 0:15:17| Chair, will you entertain a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| I have a motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=921)|

| 0:15:37| For first reading, and I will remind commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| that if this passes on first reading next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| we will have to set a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| before passing it on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Madam Clerk, we're now to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| and I actually noticed we have three individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| all to speak to the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| which at the time they signed up was not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| It is now, but we will now hear these three folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| since this item is coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| either next or just after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| First, we have Ms. Angie Gawthart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=977)|
| 0:16:28| If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Ma'am, you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| My name is Angie Gawthart, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| I honestly did not believe I would ever be back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| speaking on behalf of children and parents about masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| but here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| September 24, 2021 is the date that normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| was taken from our children and our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| many teachers and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| A lawsuit filed against the BOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| where the injunction put in place hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| those that had no defense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| How does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We elect officials to serve us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| the voters and taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Still, we have no representation in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| even though our children are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| paying the highest price for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| I was told by someone in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| that they did not represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| They represent the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| While technically that is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| we still elected the officials involved in this suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Whether it be the law director or the BOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| all of you work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Watching what has played out over the last five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| has been hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Motion after motion denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Our children are still masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| What is the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| I can assure you, as many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| I have been in this since March of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I have read more medical studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| than I ever wish to see again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| I have spoken to experts in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and data analysts trying to make it make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| It doesn't. It never has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Why has the BOE been denied outside counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| After reading a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| it is clear that the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| has a direct conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Representing both the health department and the BOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| is a conflict, as they are on opposite sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Citing the CDC, AAP, and TDOH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| and stating that masks are 80% effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| should give all of you pause and force you to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| especially since Dr. Nguyen on CNN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| said that cloth masks are no more than facial decorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| I have been able to come up with many experts and studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| showing what masks are doing to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Why am I able to do this and not the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| This is not my job. Maybe it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| With all of that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| the most glaring words in all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| came from Judge Greer himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| In the order to mask our children in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| he said, the Knox County BOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| which we know is represented by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| so their words were not used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| does not cite this three-factor test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| or conduct an analysis under all of its factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| and its failure to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| is by itself fatal to its argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| that plaintiffs claimed are not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Issues averted to in a perfunctory manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| are deemed waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| It is not sufficient for a party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| leaving the court to put bones to flesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Why were experts not brought into court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| There are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Why no teachers or parents or students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Masks are not without harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| and people are not accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Never has ADA law been used in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| The Board of Education needs outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Five months have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| and our children are suffering further learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| developing more mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| while everyone else in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| is allowed to live their best lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| It is past time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I hope that you will support a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| to allow the BOE to retain outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| and stand for everyone in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| especially our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1217)|

| 0:20:26| Evening, Ms. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| If you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Sherry Garrett, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Ms. Garthert spoke a lot of what I had to say, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| It's very emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Our children are suffering right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Their learning loss they have already suffered in the year 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| is now being expounded on by the year 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| The kids are suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| and the only obvious course right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| is to allow the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| to have outside expert counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Our law department has been woefully inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| in representing the school board and the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| because the parents and the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| are the ones that are suffering the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| They're the ones directly involved in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| They're the ones directly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So I ask you, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| allow the Board of Education to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Allow the Board of Education to hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| that can specialize in what needs to be specialized in, the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| As Ms. Garthert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| never have people been used as accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| The ADA was created to prevent physical barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| That's why you see braille letters on the elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| That's why you see wheelchair ramps going up into buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Invisible barriers were never, ever to be used in the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Thank you, Ms. Garthert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1315)|
| 0:22:13| Good evening, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| From the beginning, I've taken an interest in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| not only because, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| the folks, parents of children in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| our constituents, as well as many of the administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| and teachers as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| but because this case is about more than Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| If we go by the logic of this order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| essentially any Knox County building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| really any public building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| could also be subject to the same terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| And I would like to read from the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| This is page 11 of the initial injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| And it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| in arriving at an answer to the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| of whether a plaintiff is really seeking relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| for the denial of a free appropriate public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| excuse me, FAPE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| the Supreme Court has instructed courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| to ask a pair of hypothetical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| that was not a school, say a public theater or library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| And second, could an adult at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| say an employer or visitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| have pressed essentially the same grievance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| When the answer to those questions is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| a complaint that does not expressly allege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| the denial of a free appropriate public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| is also unlikely to be true about that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| After all, in those situations, there is no FAPE obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and yet the same basic suit could go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| But when the answer is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| then the complaint probably does concern FAPE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| even if it does not explicitly say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| In the plaintiff's case, this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| the answer to both hypothetical questions is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| The crux of the plaintiff's allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| is safe access to public brick and mortar government buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| and not the denial of a free appropriate public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| And it goes on to say, I'm skipping a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| a medically compromised teacher, custodian, parent, grandparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| or visitor could bring an identical grievance in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| whether based on safe and equal access to Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| or to another public government building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| like a library or post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| So as long as this case goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Knox County is under threat of this same order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| If someone were to decide that Knox County should have a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| in the city county buildings, our library, or anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And I guarantee you that I would be requesting from the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| to find the very best and brightest to fight that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| It's nothing against the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I have a great deal of respect for Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I think he's a really fine man and has some great lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| They don't have the bandwidth for something like this, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| and the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| You just need the best that you can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| And we do that in other areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| The county just decided to hire some consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| for our comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| because planning doesn't have the bandwidth to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Likewise, we have a transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| We hired consultants because public works and our engineering public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| does not have the bandwidth to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| And from my perspective, that's all we're asking here is just some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| because, again, I'm not going to go into all the stuff about masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| but, you know, this has reached a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| to where we need some sort of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And, again, the longer that it stays on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| the longer this is in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| the greater the threat that someone could sue the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| and say Knox County has to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| This concludes public forum for tonight's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Madam Clerk, could you please read the caption on Resolution R-22-2-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1590)|

| 0:27:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1635)|

| 0:27:40| in all litigation regarding mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Is there a motion on this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Mr. Chairman, wouldn't we have to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| since we just got it five minutes before the meeting started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I would just suggest that we send this forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| since we just received it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| and I'm already seeing a couple of words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| that probably need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| That's fine. I'll change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Is the second okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Okay, I have a motion to send this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| with no recommendation by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| and a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| This action, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| the sort of chain reaction of this started, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| We've all been given information about the sort of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I feel like we need to hear from our school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| and we need to also give our law director an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| to address the issue just so we're fully vetting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| So I'm not sure Ms. Henderson, Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| or maybe both, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I just feel like they're asking us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| We ought to hear from them to kind of get the ball rolling here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| on the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| I will state it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I, of course, was copied on a memo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| that was sent to the law director by Chairman Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Subsequently, Chairman Christie emailed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| requesting that a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| or asking if I would be willing to add a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| authorizing the board to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| I said if a resolution comes to me before the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| I'll be more than happy to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| As I'm sure my colleagues know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| it came to us about three minutes before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| However, Chairperson Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| you are more than welcome to address the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| on this issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you, Chairman Buehler, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I'm Christie Christie, 2337 Winters Drive, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| And like I requested to you, Chairman Buehler, in my email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| and just to reiterate what the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| I do respect the amount of time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| the law department has put into this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| But, you know, we have 60,000 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| and 8,000 employees, or probably more than 8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| that are affected by this, by, you know, universal masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| because of four plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| And, you know, it does concern me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| a reasonable accommodation for four people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| could affect 68,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| You know, as a mother of a child that had a speech impairment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| and some developmental issues growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I know that she would not be doing well with the mask right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| And, you know, our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| We have 3,358 kids that receive speech therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Two of those children have mask exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| You know, that's protected under Day DA2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| So, you know, I think that our children deserve...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| You know, we need to be fighting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| And, you know, again, I respect the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| that the law department has put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| but I do think that it's time we seek outside help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| And Ms. Henderson has a lot more notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| because I drove back from Nashville today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| so we'll just let her go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you, Chairman Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Ms. Henderson, if you'll state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| you may address me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you, Chairman Beeler and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Betsy Henderson, 12301 Connor Springs Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And I also have the pleasure of serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| on the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| You know, I just think it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| that we seek outside counsel on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| You know, oftentimes we talk about running government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| like a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| and no business relies on one attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| No attorney has the wide scope of every area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| and we need outside counsel for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| The law department hasn't presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| any medical experts or additional facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| They keep filing the same case that keeps losing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and who's losing out are our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| This case is affecting 60,000 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| It's affecting 8,000 staff members and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| I know that outside counsel has been seeked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| for the merit counsel cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| and this is the most prominent case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| in our county going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| We have so many areas, blue areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| opening up, lifting mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| and Knox County is still under a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| It's time for a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| and I think we need real expert attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| to handle this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Any further questions or discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| Commissioner Jay, didn't you have two points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| that you wanted to just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I just wanted to know if our law director...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I have a specific law question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| but I just didn't know if you wanted to opine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| on the matter at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I mean, we're voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| that's affecting this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Well, I just got this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Nobody had the courtesy to bring this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| to my office until it was handed to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| five minutes before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| so I'm still trying to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| and figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I can tell you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| there's some problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I don't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| if the school board wants to hire somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| to help advise us in going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| with this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| because we are in charge of this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We are the attorneys of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We're the ones that are in front of the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| We're the ones answering to Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| A couple other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| It seems to me that there seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| this feeling out there that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| oh, we'll just get another attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| that's got some ADA experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| and bingo, everything will go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and Judge Greer will change his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I got news for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| That opinion, they read from several pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| of that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| It's 56 pages long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| and there's one conclusion in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| that you've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Judge Greer feels that if one child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| is running the risk, one child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| then he feels it's his duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| to order this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Now, the proof is a doctor for this child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| is in there and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| this child is going to be hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| if you don't have masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| How are we going to overcome that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| You can say, okay, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| and in fact, in Tennessee and Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| and Nashville and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| they all have mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| and the federal courts have routinely said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| no, no, you cannot do a no-mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| That's all across this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| That's in the Fifth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| That's in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| So what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I agree with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| absolutely everything I heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I agree that 60,000 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| should not be held up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| because of two students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I agree with that 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| I agree that a federal judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| should not have authority to make policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| He's got, he's got control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| and I don't think bringing somebody else in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| and if they want to bring somebody in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| to help advise us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| This resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| I haven't really had time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Part of it on the whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| if the school board wants to hire some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| to help advise us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| we're welcome for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| We're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| But we represent, by the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| we, the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| or the law director represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| the school board in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| We believe in the school board's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| We believe in the parents' position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| and we're fighting like the dickens for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| But we've got a federal judiciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| that wants to go its own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| And how you set that aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I don't think it's going to be easily set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| by Judge Greer at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And you talk about throwing in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| He had to set a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| We can't put in any expert testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| until he sets a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| He hasn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| He has shown no inclination to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| an evidentiary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| The Sixth Circuit operates on its own calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We've got an appeal up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| I think it's an excellent appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I think we ought to win that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| But until the Sixth Circuit says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| you're going to have a date for a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| We can't make the Sixth Circuit hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| We can't make Judge Greer set a hearing date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| for evidentiary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I have no problem with anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| coming in if the school board wants to hire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| but they cannot litigate this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| There's probably the legal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| you were going to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| I think the whereas clauses, most of them are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| But the therefore be it resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Knox County Commission hereby directs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| the Knox County Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| on behalf of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| to hire an attorney to advise and represent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| in all matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Commission, under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| has no authority to order the law director to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| We're open if the school board decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| they want to hire an attorney to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| We're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| But that resolution, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| It's not in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| You cannot order the law director what he must do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And I haven't had a time since I just got this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| to really look at it and evaluate it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| But I agree with everything that was said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| 100% agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I do not like legislation from the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| That's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| We've got judges legislating from the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| Director, can you just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| because there's been some back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| about sort of who has the power to do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| I pulled the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| which seems pretty clear about the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| I'm going to just take snippets of Section D here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| that says that their role and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| is to execute and administer all the legal affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| And then it has a very specific paragraph here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| or sentence that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| no elected or appointed officer or employee of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| shall employ any other attorney to represent the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| or any other officer, board, or member of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| unless he, she shall first be authorized and empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| to do so by resolution of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| That's what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| But could you also just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| I pulled the Tennessee Code, this is 49.2203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| These are the duties and the powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| And it is quite lengthy, but there is a section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| make sure I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| This is 15B5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| It says the local Board of Education has the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| to employ legal counsel to advise and represent the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| So Tennessee state law says they can already do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| Our charter says they can't do it without permission from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| which is what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| But are those conflicting, or which supersedes the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Number one, that's been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Number two, at the time of the passage of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| it stated there's an exemption in there for any municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| or county that has its own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| That specifically says this doesn't apply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| That's when that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And that's what the legislative history showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Secondly, the question has already been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| It cost the taxpayers $286,000 back in 2000 through 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| The school board wanted its own attorney based on that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Mike Moyers, former law director, former chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| who is now back in our office, was there then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| and he handled that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| He knows that lawsuit in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Bottom line was Sharon Bell, after much litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| held as the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Look, yes, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| But under the charter, which takes precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| the law director is the one who represents the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| That was then taken on appeal by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| And before the court of appeals ruled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| everything I got from that massive file was that the lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| for the school board saw after argument before the court of appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| that he's going to lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| So they got together and they came up with a consent agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| and that agreement says that the law director represents the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| And the only time that it wouldn't is if there is a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| as defined by the Board of Professional Responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| And at that point and that point only can the school board get its own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| And somebody said there's a conflict because we represent the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Let's get something clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The proof that they want, we have a CDC, the Tennessee Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| and I put in that memo, go straight to that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and it talks about masking being necessary and helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| in providing transmission of this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| And our Knox County Health Board, the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Now, you want me, people want me to go in front of a Judge Greer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| who's already taken one expert and said it does, and take those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| I would be laughed out of court if I did that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| because he would say, well, by your own health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| masks are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| By your own Department of Health, the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| By your own Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, you've got to have something more than just a desire to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| and have one expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| And here's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Judges weigh experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| He can accept one expert or just reject an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| I mean, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Judges do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| There's no guarantee of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| I have just two quick questions for somebody from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Larson, can I ask a question of the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Just come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| The CDC, the health board, those are recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| We're talking about mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| The CDC, the health board, they make recommendations of face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| They don't say school boards, schools should mandate face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| No, but that's proof that the judge looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| The other proof that the judge has right now is the peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| We have peaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| We have peaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| How do you go in front of a judge and say, oh, well, you know, it keeps going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| School's going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| That's the kind of proof that a judge looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| A judge will look at what the CDC says, even though you're right, it's a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| But he will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I don't agree with those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| But that's what they are, and that's what this judge is going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Can I ask one other question on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| You said that in the, I don't even know what you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| That shows you what I know about law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Your summary is ruling that it boiled down to one line where one of the doctors said that that one child was unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2661)|
| 0:44:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| How does that require a mandate in a totally different school building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I agree with you, and I have raised that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| It has been raised twice in front of Judge Greer, and it's being raised very eloquently by David Sanders in the appeal in the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2678)|
| 0:44:49| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| He flat didn't look at the effect it would have, which he has to do under law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| He did not look at the effect on third parties, the other 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| He didn't do it, and we appealed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| We've said you're wrong, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| The other thing I wanted to bring up is this is brought by two of the members of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| I want you to know this has not been authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| What they've done has not been authorized by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| They have not passed any resolution seeking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| This is two members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| In fact, at the last meeting on February 9th, a motion was made to allow the department to continue, the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| now that they have heard all the Board's thoughts, to do everything they feel is possible as quickly as they can that does not violate rules or jeopardize the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2734)|
| 0:45:44| That's the official act of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| Not the request that two members are making here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| That is not the Board of Education's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Mr. Jay, do you have some questions for the Board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| I have three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I just added one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Can Susan speak to that last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Well, let me tell you my three questions, and you guys can figure out who wants to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| There's three of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Maybe you each get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| My first question is going to be, why didn't the Board vote unilaterally to ask us to do the action that is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2772)|
| 0:46:22| My second question is, to clarify, are you asking to hire outside counsel to advise the existing case and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2782)|
| 0:46:33| or to take it over and ask them to step aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| And then my third question is, besides the taxpayers who pay for everything, who's going to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Are you asking us to appropriate funds, or would you cover the expense in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| So those are my three questions, and take them as you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| Let's start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| I didn't make a motion at the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| This is Betsy Henderson with the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I didn't make a motion at the last school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I did have a letter that did not make it around to all the school board members that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| and according to the county charter, the action is up to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| They don't need a vote from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| So I said that I was going to take this in front of county commission either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| And I would like to, can I address some of the things that Mr. Buke said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Let me address some of my questions first, and then I'll kind of let it go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| So I guess this body, I guess the question would be, are you all acting on behalf of the whole school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| or what if one person just asked us to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| I think we're looking to, as a school board, to have the power to make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| so that we have the authorization to have outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| So if this body were to approve this, you would all still go back and vote on it within your governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| whether to take action on that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| So the second question is, are you asking, permission, I hate to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| but are you asking us to authorize the hiring of outside counsel to advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| and to sort of attach themselves to the case or advise the law department in a very specialized way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| or to take it over and have them walk away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| I would like to see somebody take it over, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| I've been very, and I think several board members, parents in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| are very disappointed in how this case has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Mr. Buick, tonight, didn't even know a lot of the facts that were going on in this specific case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| How would that work, given that our charter says that the law department is the lawyer for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| There's not a lot of wiggle room in that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| In the charter, it says that the county commission has the authorization to grant another body outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| And my last question, and I feel like that piece of the onion is going to be peeled back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| and I won't get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| I'll let somebody else discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Who would pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| The taxpayers will pay for it, but whose budget will it come out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| To my understanding, the law department has money to seek outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| and Mr. Buick has already, the plaintiffs are already asking for $250,000, and that was in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| So he's already cost us $250,000 if he had just asked for outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| and admitted that this was out of his scope months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| So this would come out of the county general budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Out of the budget that is already allotted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Okay, not out of the school board budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| If we needed to work with the school board, I don't know if Ron wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| Ron is going to run away very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| But to my understanding, there is money currently in the law department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Okay, so you would be asking for an appropriation from the law department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I will say this, and I appreciate your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| because as the chairman who agreed to sponsor this resolution on behalf of the school board chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3003)|
| 0:50:13| I'm not comfortable with directing the school board to do anything from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| What I am comfortable with is any mechanism that is allowed under the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| by which commission could grant another elected body the authority to take this type of action on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| So that's why this resolution needs to be looked at before we take any further action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Mr. Schoonmaker, you're on his own, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| There's a couple of, I guess, background information that I'd like the answers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| and I guess this would be directed to the law director, Boog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Currently, for the federal case out of Greene County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| how many members of your staff or what is the legal team that's working on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Eight out of our ten lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Day in, day out, every day we meet on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| We have researched every case that's come down, what's happening in other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| So, yes, it's a day-to-day thing for eight attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| And then currently you referenced that there's three other counties in Tennessee that have mask mandates besides us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| so it's a total of four out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Yeah, they have their own mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| They have not been imposed by the feds or by a federal district court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| but what happened is in Memphis and Nashville and Chattanooga, I forgot to check on Kingsport up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| they have imposed their own mask mandates as our school board did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| They had a mask mandate of their own, then they got rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| So those other schools in the other districts are not under a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| but what happened was the governor passed the statute, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| that provided that couldn't force mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| That statute was passed and immediately, immediately in the middle district of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| they went to the federal district court, and that federal district court put an injunction against the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| from executing and administering that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| So no matter what happens, that law doesn't have effect anymore until that's heard before the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| It's a complex mixing of things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| The mask mandates for children, and, you know, we keep up with all of this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| and by the way, I don't know, nobody has given a reason why our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| which deals with and has dealt with ADA daily, our lawsuits with ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| I've been in this office for 10, almost 12 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| It's a daily thing with ADA lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| We have the best experts there are in ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I have yet to hear anybody explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| They just think that if we get another attorney, boom, it will all go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| And then one of the speakers gave a date of September 24th of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| That was the date that the ruling was issued by the judge or thereabouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| No, it was . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Because what my follow-up question to that is, is then how many actual hearings has he had in Greene County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| where your team has gone up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| We've been up there for . . . here's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| We got served mid-afternoon on a Friday, September 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Mid-afternoon on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| The judge sent us a notice that he was going to have a hearing on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| We got two weekend days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| We've got two working days to try to get something together that the plaintiffs had been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| Obviously, they had their experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| They had everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| We raised that issue with the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Said, this is an ambush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| The judge said, well, that's the nature of injunctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| It's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| That's the situation we were in, and that was kind of the mindset that this judge had and still seems to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| I forgot what your question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| How many times have we had to appear before this judge since they issued that original . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Twice. That's all he has ordered us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| We were there when we filed the motion to lift the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| We were up there asking him to modify his order and gave every reason that I've heard out here to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| He ignored every bit of it and said, no, deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| That's when we took it up to the Sixth Circuit on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And we've got an excellent chance of winning, depending on which panel we get up there, on winning at the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| But we have no control over their docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| I wanted to throw something else in I didn't, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| One of the motions that was passed by the Board of Education was a motion to have the Knox County law . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3322)|
| 0:55:34| This is the kind of . . . They're putting their trust in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| The majority is. Several aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| At any rate, this motion was to approve Knox County Law Department to engage in non-binding negotiations over the mask mandate litigation . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3341)|
| 0:55:51| within the parameters of state law, with the Board of Education, represented by Board Chair Christy Christie . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| Knox County School staff represented Jason Myers . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| And, we have already opened that door with opposing counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| So, we are engaging. We're doing what the Board has asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| We have engaged in trying to come to a negotiation with a settlement, a mediation, whatever you want to call it, with the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| So, and we will continue to do that, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| This body passes or . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| So, at any rate, I just wanted you to know, we're doing exactly what the Board has voted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Okay. And, Mr. Chairman, I had noticed that school board member, Susan Horn, had come to the podium . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| And, I wanted to give her the opportunity, if you wanted to make a statement to us, or . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Since she is my school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| Very well. Ms. Horn, if you'll . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| And, very well respected in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Yes, sir. Thank you, Commissioner. If you'll state your name and address for us, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Susan Horn, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Well, I was . . . I wanted to say that the letter that Board Member Henderson passed around, I wasn't able to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| And, I think that her . . . But, I knew that her intention was to bring it before this body, so that . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Then, it could be offered up to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I think that part of our frustration is that there are studies that talk about mask efficacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3435)|
| 0:57:24| And, that things have changed drastically in the past six months, since September 24th, or since September 10th, when this was served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3444)|
| 0:57:33| So, that is another . . . That is another issue that, I think . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Obviously, this revolves around the ADA, but we're very concerned that there's no new . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| That it doesn't appear that the law department wants to look at any new medical evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| And, there is new medical evidence. And, it's very important in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And, I think that's part of why, even as . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| Around the country, as mask mandates are being lifted, there are still lots of cases of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| However, at the same time, new evidence is coming out and evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| And, that's what happens with science. And, we can't ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| And, I think by ignoring that, we . . . That's a huge disservice to the students of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| Our highest goal is to make sure that the students of Knox County are educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| That they are progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| We hear from . . . I hear from kindergarten, first grade teachers, second grade teachers, who are extremely concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| Because, students are not developing as they should, at this age, as they're learning to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| Because, they can't see their teacher's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Ms. Christie already mentioned students with special needs, with speech delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| We are extremely concerned about these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| This is our highest goal, is to make sure that students are educated and developing as they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| And, at every turn, that's being impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| So, our board is . . . We spoke . . . We talked about this subject at length, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| Because, we have . . . We are . . . We just feel a sense of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| We need help. We need . . . We need something to move and change in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| And, so that's why we spent the time last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| That's why we . . . There were several motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| So, that's . . . That's just kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| And, we continue to feel a sense of urgency from our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And, some more than others, as Commissioner Schoonmaker knows, our end of town is extremely, extremely upset and concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3571)|
| 0:59:41| So, that's why we're here. Thank you. I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Thank you, Board Member Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Commissioner Biggs, your light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Ms. Horne, I have a question for you. Representative Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| You spoke about specific areas throughout the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| Have you all done any look into other states, or anything like that, that order us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| Or, Florida, or anything that might be happening down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Are there lawsuits? Are there not lawsuits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I mean, in Florida, or wherever. Have you looked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| I think there are some similar lawsuits around in Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| I can't remember where the other one is. There's another one that's similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| And, they all seem to be just a little bit different, which I think, from what I understand, makes a large difference in legal terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3626)|
| 1:00:35| Did the state of Florida go through something like this already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| So, there's no case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| No, because they basically, no. They have not that I know of, that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Your light was on, then it went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Yeah, I hit it twice. You can go before me, because I'm not in a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| I think what we've got here is there's two different sciences working against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| One of them is the science of health. The other one is the science of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And, they are completely polarized in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| Judges have a certain attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| I hate to say this. I know some really good judges, and I know some judges that I wouldn't want even close to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| And, how they rule things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| So, what we have here is we have a law department that has taken the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| And, I think you've got it to another appeals court, Sixth Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| If you think government works slow, the courts work even slower, because they can drag things on forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| And, it sounds like we've got a judge that doesn't want to hear, doesn't want to understand, no matter who you bring before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| And, if you keep bringing other people before that judge, you're going to make that judge even worse than what he is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| So, we've got to go through an appeal cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| And, again, you say the science is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| But, what's before the judge is what he's got before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| And, I don't know how you get these other pieces of information to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| They either accept it or they won't accept it. Is that correct, Mr. Boock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| I didn't catch the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I said it's up to the judge to decide whether they're going to accept any new evidence or not have any new evidence. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Absolutely. I mean, this is an injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| And, if it stays in effect, the judge will set a trial date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| But, he hasn't done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| But, he's got to set that trial date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| And, any other judge has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| And, if you start now, you're going to start from the bottom again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| And, they're going to go back with the precedent that that judge, Judge Greer, set in the next case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| So, we're in a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| We could throw a ton of money at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| But, until the judge wants to move, he's not going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| So, we've got to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Are we going to spend money or are we going to see how far we can go with what we've got before us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| And, again, I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I hope we never had a mask in the first place because they never did work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| And, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| And, we had a big problem up here when we were trying to talk to the health department about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| So, we've been through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| So, I don't know what we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| I don't understand the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| And, I don't understand the science sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| So, I'm hoping the law will figure out a way to take care of the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| And, with us just getting here batting before each other and throwing money at something that's not going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| or other people, it just doesn't seem like it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| So, wherever we've got to right now, we've just got to keep trudging forward with what we've got before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| and try to get it before a judge that will hear what you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| So, that was just what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Commissioner Bousler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Chairman Bieler, I kind of agree with your assessment, too, after getting this three minutes beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| and reading through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| I do think this needs to be edited a little bit to give the Board of Education the power to make this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| not us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And, whether the Board decides to use, if we do grant you this power to hire, whether you use it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3881)|
| 1:04:51| I think at least a common ground from what Director Booker is saying that he's comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| is to maybe hire at least an expert to counsel us a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| I get super passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I know the Mayor and I have had several conversations, and we both get pretty fired up about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Like, the idea of suffocating 60,000 kids a day just gets my blood pumping, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| and it gets me pretty upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| And I know if that was my kid that I would want the Michael Jordan of lawyers on my side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| I'd want the biggest, meanest bulldog in the yard on my side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So, I 100% agree, and I definitely think that if we need to hire the Michael Jordan or the All-Star team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3931)|
| 1:05:42| whatever that means or how much money that takes for our kids' safety and health and mental well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3942)|
| 1:05:51| I don't think you can put a price on that, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| So, I do think this needs to be adjusted, but just wanted to share my general opinion on the whole matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you, Commissioner Ward. Director Booker, your light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| I just wanted to clarify, number one, what Ms. Horne was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| I agree with it 100%. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| I agree with everything that's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| The judge doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| And the comment was made about not keeping up with the medical hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| We know all of the medical things that there are out there right now, and there are all sorts of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| and you can't just come in and say, Judge, John Hopkins says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| That's hearsay evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| It's not admissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| It's true, and we know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| So, it's wrong to say that we haven't kept up with all the medical things that are going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| We know all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| It's just whether or not they're admissible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Number two, the Florida case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Yes, in Florida, DeSantis, the governor, did exactly what our governor did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| He said a no mask mandate, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| He did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Immediately, that went to federal court, and it was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| So, yes, something did happen in Florida, and Florida's under the same thing with regard to those mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| and the federal courts are controlling down there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| And the other thing was when you look at these things where people say mask mandates are going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| It's a political thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| The liberal states are finally dropping off because they're afraid of the midterm elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| but if you look at these, you will find that the school mask mandates in many of these jurisdictions are held in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4055)|
| 1:07:45| although generally to the general public, the mask mandates are being lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| But the schools are still under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Commissioner Hill, and then Smith, and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Director Boot, I'm hearing that Knox County Law Department, you believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4079)|
| 1:08:12| and it seems you're doing everything possible that you can do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| I'm a little bit interested in you had kind of opened the door a little bit about some possibility of mediation or negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4096)|
| 1:08:27| Have any attorneys with the law department spoken directly with the plaintiff's attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| and made any attempt to perhaps negotiate with the, I mean, I don't know these parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| I don't know them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I'm really wondering if their intent was to put masks to 60,000 kids when they went into this whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| and maybe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| But the ramifications seem such that I'm wondering if there would be any hope of a settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4133)|
| 1:09:03| Well, we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I mean, we're doing exactly what the Board of Education has asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| So have you all reached out to plaintiff's attorneys and asked for a sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| We've got to get tricky on this sort of thing because we can go into executive session with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| and say, look, this is what has been offered and here's where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| and they can't make a decision on that because they can't vote in an executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| They then have to come out and vote and say, okay, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| we want to go with what this mediated or negotiated settlement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| We're doing what the board wanted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I'm familiar with the executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Yeah, I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| I know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I sat through many of them with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Yes, yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| So just to be clear, there is active negotiation or active attempts at some mediation with plaintiff's attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4198)|
| 1:10:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Let me tell you something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I think I mentioned this to the board or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| From Susan Crabtree, who was probably the greatest expert in ADA law that's retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| and she taught Amanda and David Sanders in our office, and that's why I say they're the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| There's only one other that even matches them, and that's the lawyer that's representing these plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| He's the only lawyer in the state of Tennessee that handles these cases except for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| But his attitude is, see, under ADA, he gets attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| He can get a minor thing just saying, oh, you've got to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| and he'll get a half a million dollar in attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| That's why he does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| He is a scorched earth type lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| So we're dealing with that attitude, and I don't even know what he takes back to his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| We would take back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| If we get something that they're willing to do, we would go to the school board and say recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| and tell them about what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| So, yeah, we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| I don't want to mess that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Ms. Horne also made a motion that I appoint Houston Havasey in our office to assist Amanda Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4282)|
| 1:11:32| He already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| He's already helping because we operate with all the attorneys working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| If she would like, if the essence of that motion is to put his name down there on the list of attorneys, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4299)|
| 1:11:47| So we're doing everything that the board is authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| And I'll stand by that, and we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| The negotiation is the most important one, I think, that was raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| and I think Ms. Horne made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| No, it was Virginia Babb made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| But at any rate, I can't tell you any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| And then there's legalities of kicking the law director out and hiring outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| I don't want another lawsuit, but we will enforce the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Mike Morgan knows how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| He did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Would you please briefly address the comments that our mayor made about the concerns of this boil-over spread to other public buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4346)|
| 1:12:38| that is really of a general concern to many of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| That was what was brought up by plaintiff's counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| I don't think it had any meaningful thing whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| I mean, if you can take it to its extreme and say, okay, if a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| I got to go back and look, but that was almost a throw-off thing that the judge said in that 56-page opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4384)|
| 1:13:12| I can't really address it because I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| but that was just one little blurb out of that opinion that really had nothing to do with the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| I might suggest, merely suggest, that in the law director's communication with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4401)|
| 1:13:29| and even if this has to occur in an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| that they might be given a little bit more specifics and details about exactly what steps have been taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4413)|
| 1:13:43| what has been tried, what types of negotiation, mediation have been put out there to perhaps calm the school board waters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4423)|
| 1:13:53| so to speak, so that they may feel a little more secure in the actions of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| You are reading my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I have already set out, because there's so much misinformation out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| that I am, as we sit here, drafting a comprehensive report on how it got there, the status of it, what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4447)|
| 1:14:16| what will happen in the future as a public document, because I can only –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| I can't comment on the litigation under the federal rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| I can only list out what's in the pleadings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| But you've read my mind, and I'm in the process and hope I'll have that out by the end of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| a complete explanation of everything, where we're going, what we have, what we have in our arsenal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| and I cannot predict when these judges are going to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| I just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| And no matter who you get, add-on or whatever, it's up to the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Commissioner Smith, your light is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Mr. Law Director, can the Board of Education and the Law Director not countersue the plan on the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| that they are harming our students and our educational process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| Under what theory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Well, I don't know you're the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| No, because the minute you do that, if you say it's an ADA issue, they're not disabled students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| The 60,000 aren't disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Gowrie, please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| There's 800, I think, that are under IDEA, I think, students in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4538)|
| 1:15:48| I'm talking about the normal system, the first grader who's trying to learn phonics, that can't because a mask is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| That argument has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| We have made that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| That argument is before the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| It was before Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| It got rejected out of hand by Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| So you're saying you can't bring a countersuit against these claimants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Well, it wouldn't be a countersuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| It's just saying, Judge Greer, you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| I mean, what's the countersuit if he says, he's already said, look, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| It'd have to be a . . . it's not a countersuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| You'd have to bring a separate complaint, but it's really a defense under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| I mean, that's . . . I guess if somebody wanted to file one, if somebody out here wanted to file one, they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| You had mentioned Susan Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Has your office thought of bringing her in to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Yeah, I wanted to bring her back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| She's retired, but she is very happy in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| She has a grandson that she takes care of twice a day, the sweetest person in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| Yeah, she's not interested in coming back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Okay, and in all the . . . I know, and I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| I work daily with the law department, and they are really good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| I work with several of the attorneys almost on a daily basis, so I do know they are good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| Now, I do know this is something outside normal day-to-day operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| Can you ever think of an example where an ABA compliance imposed upon someone else's body, something they had to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4641)|
| 1:17:32| This is absolutely new, and it's the only one, and it's brought about by COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| and the judge has put himself in and saying what he said in his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| No, there's no other time that it's been done, and we pointed that out to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| This doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| You can't use ABA in this case, but the judge rejected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Twice we said that, and now it's up to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the same argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| So if the CDC, the Knox County Health Department, if everywhere they said masks are no longer required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4685)|
| 1:18:16| we would still be under this until we get a trial day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| We would still be under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| We have been asked by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Oh, it was by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| She had a motion which was passed wanting us to file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| and what she said was file a change of circumstances, which is not a motion that is applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| I mean, it's not, but we're good doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| and it says the reference is that vaccines are available to everyone in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| school buildings, that mask mandates are being lifted all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| that masks protect the wearer, and any other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| So we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Motion that Ms. Horn, we're working on that right now, but here's the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| If you look at what's going to happen, right now we're still peaked up there, but it's dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| It's got to get down to get this judge's attention on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| and then what's Joe Biden going to say on March 1st because he's got all these Democrats saying lift the mask mandates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| He's going to say pandemic's over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| But we're working on that as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Okay. I don't want to find ourselves trapped, stuck in a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| when it seems like we are moving out of this, and we have actually peaking coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| No question. No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| And I also am very wary of what the mayor said, as Commissioner Hill commented to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| that somebody could go anywhere right now into one of our libraries or into this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| and get the same ruling from this injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| That's a possibility, and we raised that issue that you can't do that, Judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| but if somebody wants to file over here in the library with children that have disabilities of some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4822)|
| 1:20:32| and go in front of Judge Greer, they're probably going to get that same ruling, and it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| It's just wrong, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| It's not just legally, but it's just wrong, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| As you revisit this, I mean, this is being moved forward with no recommendation next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| and as you have already opined that there's some language that may need some tweaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| I would like to ask for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| I would be open to this, a couple of amendments to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| specifying that if the action was, you know, if the authority is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| if the action to be to advise, because I don't believe, according to our charter, you could replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| I don't think the school board can unilaterally replace the law director from the suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| so I think that somehow needs to be outlined in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| and then I would also be more comfortable with adding some language to specify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| if they did choose to act with our authority and hire outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| that it must be paid for out of the school board budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| If they're going to direct the action, if they're going to pick the lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| if that's outside of the decision-making power of the law department, certainly can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| Then, therefore, require a certain amount of money out of a budget of a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| that's already been approved last year for the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| So if they're going to take that action, it needs to come out of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| and their budget is our budget and it's the Nox County taxpayer budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| but I don't think you can direct action and then tell somebody else what to pay for kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| So I just would recommend to you those two things you at least consider when you look at the language amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're next, and I will give the maker of the motion the last word on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| What would happen if the superintendent of Nox County Schools said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| beginning tomorrow morning, our children would not wear masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| What would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| I would imagine that Justin Gilbert, the attorney, would immediately be filing a motion for contempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| and haul the superintendent in front of him and hold him in contempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| for which he could throw him in jail, he could fine him, he could do a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| because he would be in contempt of that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| But you'd have a hearing before the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| But only on the contempt, only on the contempt issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| Contempt because this is an injunction at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| and it's only on whether you violated the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| That would be the sole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| I just thought if you got another chance in front of the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| I would love to find another chance to get this judge as indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| He doesn't want to hear the proof at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| One last question, and then from what I hear you saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| that you don't think there's any path forward with this judge in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Are we putting all our eggs in the basket of the appeal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| That's what it sounds like you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Well, two answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Number one, as was the motion that was made at the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| which we're pursuing, is if everything goes down, it drops drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5045)|
| 1:24:14| It goes down to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Our local Board of Health, and they'll follow CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| and if the feds and the CDC back off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| then we've got a change of circumstances that are facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| that we can go in front of the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| So, yeah, that would be good if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| Other than that, yes, we're pinning our hopes on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| just to lift the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| If the injunction is lifted, then the case will go forward on . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| And I think we would win the case on the facts if we could go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| So I think from hearing from everybody at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| we need to make some adjustments to this document before it's passable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| or before we can get everybody to agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| So, Chairman, if you give me some advice, what's the best way to handle . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| Well, we probably need to edit this before we go and vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| Do I need to amend my motion or anything of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| I don't think the motion needs to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| I think the motion is just to move this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| It's not like an ordinance that we're passing in the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| So under the understanding that we're going to make some edits to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| and it'll look slightly different to next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| when we can have a further discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| So, again, that . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Before we wrap up, I think we've got one more light after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Does anybody from the school board have any other comments they'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| before we kind of move past this and make a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| If you want to yield to Ms. Christie, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| Just a few remarks based on what I heard at the negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| That motion that was passed at the school board meeting last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| was to allow myself and Jason Myers to negotiate with the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| Of course, any agreements we came to would have to come back to the full board for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| But being involved in those, I don't want to give anybody any false expectations that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| you know, we're going to come back next week and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| yay, no masks, because I'm not that optimistic from where I'm standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| or what I've seen in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Also, as far as someone asked about suing on behalf of the other kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| and the comment was made that those children don't have disabilities, that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| Since the last meeting, and I raised the concerns about the kids with speech impairments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| which are covered under ADA, I have been getting countless e-mails and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| of people just pleading, please advocate for my child's disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| because they're not getting an exemption either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| So to say that we don't have children out there with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| that this is not having a negative impact on, is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Absolutely not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And as far as cost, you know, I've talked to Mr. McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| and I think, you know, ultimately it's not just my decision to make that it's worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| but I would also like just to add the cost of additional lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| when these other children come and sue us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| the cost of making up for what they're missing in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| the cost of increased services to speech and other services that they're not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5272)|
| 1:28:01| or they're falling behind on as far as language development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| There are lots of costs here that go far beyond paying for attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| and I think it's important for people to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I mean, I don't see how we can afford not to pay for it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5291)|
| 1:28:19| And then as far as the mental health, well, the medical experts, yes, the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| the health department, we've heard those, but what about the mental health experts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| They're medical experts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| What about the speech pathologists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| They're medical experts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| What about the audiologists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| There are all kinds of other medical experts that could speak to these other children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| that are not getting exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| I mean, this is not a reasonable accommodation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| It's hurting a lot of other kids, and it's hurting staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| and it's also creating a burden on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| I mean, we're losing staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| We have teachers in South Knoxville, and Carson, I know you've heard this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| that say, you know, if we end this year with masks, they will be going somewhere else next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5345)|
| 1:29:14| You know, we're just desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| We need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| If I could, every one of those arguments I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| I agree with Ms. Christie's, what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| and we have made those arguments to the judge and in the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| What I hear tonight is, Mr. Buick, you don't even know some of the facts of your own case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| Knox County peaked on January 18th, so we are well past the peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| You mentioned that we have maybe 800 under ADA, more like 8,000 under ADA that this is affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| How many times have you spoken to the plaintiffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| How many medical experts have you spoken to since September 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| I know you can't bring articles and newspaper articles to court because it's hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| but in my presentation last week, when I did bring those articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| I then contacted all of the infectious disease experts who wrote those, Harvard-educated doctors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5419)|
| 1:30:28| and four of them got back to me, four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| You spoke to Susan's change of circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| It took you five months to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| This is the most important case going on in Knox County right now, the most important case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| and you don't even know the basic facts of what's going on in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Multiple times tonight we've heard change of circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| and I was up here looking at some stuff on my phone about when Judge Greer was talking about this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| and it looks like this decision is based off the Delta variant, and we're on the Omicron now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5469)|
| 1:31:18| Given the science and everything that goes into that, is that considered a change of circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5478)|
| 1:31:33| He's dealing with it now, his amended order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| He had two, the first one, and then when we called his attention to some of those things, he amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| He denied us any relief, but he amended it, so now he's got that under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| Also, I was wrapping around what Commissioner Ward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| I'm just wanting to see, is there any light at the end of the tunnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| What can we tell parents, the direction and where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| Do we even know where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| Right now it seems like we don't really know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| If we're going to make a decision as a body to allow the possibility of the school board to have outside legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| I would like to know all the instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| We just talked about Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| We talked about some of our surrounding states, other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| I would like to know what can our next step forward be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| because I feel like right now from the hundreds of emails that we've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| parents are starting to feel hopeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| and I don't like parents feeling that way whenever it comes down to their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| I mean, 60,000 kids, and their lives were impacting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Like Chairman Beeler stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| this has given the school board an opportunity to have outside legal counsel in the direction of this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| but at the exact same time, if this is implying just a shred of hope in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| then I'm for that as well, just because I feel like it's our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| and I saw something that broke my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Okay, I mean, everybody in here knows I have a little four-year-old girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| When this started, the kids were in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Now those kids are in second grade, and I don't know Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I do not know Judge Greer, but I can tell you from looking at this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| this guy's going to push it to go through the end of the school year, so then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Do we fight this over the summer and hopefully have some sort of amazing act that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| and we don't push it into the next school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And I'm here to say I think all the help that we can provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| the law director's office, the county mayor, the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| you know, we fight this as a team because they're fighting us as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| and I think Director Book's got some great points, but in my line of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| we do this thing, and it's called all leads exhausted, not to be found in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| You know, obviously that doesn't hear, but I would like to see all leads exhausted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| and we charge back as much as we possibly can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| and if that means outside counsel, then I understand that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| but I'm just worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| At the end of the day, I'm very worried about our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| and our parents in the middle of capacity that they have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Commissioner Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| I think one of the biggest things that's changed is vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| Kids five and up can now be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| But Law Director Book, I had a question, and, again, this is going to show my ignorance of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| but do injunctions not sometimes or can they contain sunsets or review dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| since they are usually on something that . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| Only if the judge puts one in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Do we ask for one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| We ask to take it away totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Here's what you might be thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| If you go in to get a restraining order without any proof or any evidentiary hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| the judge can give one on affidavits and it's good for ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| After that, he's got to have the hearing, which is what he had at hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| that they obviously had prepared a month for at least, and we had two days to prepare for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| That's the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| But, no, there's no limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| That injunction could stay there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| That just seems kind of strange on something that's evolving and changing as a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| I agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| I have not disagreed with anything I've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| I am in agreement, and we have fought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| We have represented those issues to the judge and the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Motion before us by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| is to send this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| All in favor of doing that, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| This is item number 41, discussion item regarding redistricting updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| Shifting gears, Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Well, it's good we have a couple of school board members still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| But anyways, what I was looking at is because we have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| many of us have a lot of our territory being shifted from one commission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| and one school board district over to another commission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| and another school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| And do we need to be working with our counterparts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| As an example, I'm losing a big chunk of my territory to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| So that if there is an issue that would be potentially ongoing past September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5819)|
| 1:37:09| should Commissioner Ward be in on that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| if it's a stormwater issue or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| not something that could be filling a pothole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| And the same for our counterparts on school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Should they be looking at, you know, transitioning over to the next representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| Now, we all know that on May 3rd that people that normally would vote in the 5th district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| that are now in the 4th district will be going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| and electing a school board member from the 4th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| However, theoretically, though, that territory doesn't transfer until August 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| or after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| But I just kind of want to put that out there because there is some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| There's a lot of people that don't realize that, in my case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| they normally would go to A.L. Lotz to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| The word hasn't gotten out that now that's part of the 4th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| There is somebody running for school board in the 4th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| and they're going to need to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| And community meetings and things from now until the end of the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| we need to just kind of reemphasize, hey, did you know this is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| Like your 6th district is losing some to the 3rd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| So those people are prepared because, you know, people walking in for early voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| can always say, well, hey, you know, I normally vote in the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| Nothing's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Why am I now voting for a, you know, county commissioner in the 3rd district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| So, but there's no standard across the state as far as how to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| So it would be just up to how we want to handle it here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| where something with the 1st district going to the 2nd and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| I think you make a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| And I think when the new terms start for the next set of officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| September 1st, everything will have been transitioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| But I think it's incumbent on all of us to really make sure which precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| have shifted out of our districts, into our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| and which commissioner we currently share those with and communicate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| Yeah. Well, and I did request that they do update the Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| you know, what is it, knoxcountydistricts.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| and they went ahead and updated it and put the map that we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| And then as you scroll down on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| it's listing the 11 precincts that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| So if you normally voted in Shannondale, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| now it goes from here to here, or Ball Camp Pike or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| So Ball Camp Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| So anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| No, thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220215?start=5998)|
