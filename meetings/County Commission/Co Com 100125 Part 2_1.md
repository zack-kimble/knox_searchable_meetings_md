| 2:46:36| when there are already constraints on the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| All that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| If I thought that a postponement was for the purpose of sitting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| and having a discussion about a particular problem that we could do something about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:52| maybe make some change to cure or to minimize, then that would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| But what you hear here is, no, don't do this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| Just do two acres and put something else in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| That's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| It's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| So there's no reason to have a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| We've been at this since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| And these neighborhoods out there first heard of this project and this proposal from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:22| So I don't believe a postponement is an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| And, frankly, you probably are familiar enough with me that I don't often say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:35| but I think I say that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| The fact that they talked about the postponement of the matter that's at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| that postponement was at the request of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| It's going to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| When MPC considered this proposal, they were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| act on this as if that three-acre parcel were before you because it is in the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10076)|
| 2:48:02| and it is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| And they discussed it as part of their approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| unanimous approval of the rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| So I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| This is 15 acres approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| Only six is going to be used for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| The other nine is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| I want to be very clear about that, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| What I said was what is currently on this concept plan that has been submitted to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:35| and coming up would involve about that much acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| Can there be some additional development on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| or the adjacent 3.4 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| The answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| And it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| But, again, it's got to be approved all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| Total, out of the total of 15 acres, by the time you take out what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10137)|
| 2:49:04| you're probably talking about a total developable area of something between nine and 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10144)|
| 2:49:13| That would be about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| Out of the total of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| Mr. Huber, I drive by this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| I'm very familiar with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| And I'll have to say this is a pretty tough zoning for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| Most of them are pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| I've gotten calls from friends that live in the area where the husband is absolutely for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10176)|
| 2:49:42| And the wife is not quite so for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| But I want to ask you a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| In this economy, I don't believe that single-family residential is possible for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:57| But it is valuable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| It's on a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| Something's going to be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| Someone mentioned condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| Can you tell me if this site were developed for condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| and I understand this is going to take a lot of speculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| what percentage of the land would have buildings on it if it were a traditional condominium complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10215)|
| 2:50:22| versus what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| What I'm wondering is what would preserve more green space, what you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| or a condominium development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| I think the unequivocal answer is what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| If you roll a residential development in here, especially a higher-density deal like a condominium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| you're going to use every square inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| You're not going to get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| They're not going to donate anything to parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| The floor space would have to be maximized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| That's why you do condominiums, so you can fit more of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| You attach them all the way down the line and grade that stuff all the way up to the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| that creek that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:01| Right now, it's got a really nice buffer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| It's got trees as big around as this table, 100-foot-tall oaks that are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10264)|
| 2:51:08| The way we have this designed by design is that we are trying to save those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10268)|
| 2:51:14| To me, honestly, from a retailer standpoint, that's what sells the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| It's a nice community where people want to bring their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| They want to come over and they want to walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| We've got a little green space in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| But to answer your question specifically, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| we would ultimately have to strip the land and pile every square inch in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| But it's still not feasible even at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:37| You know, as I look at this, these look like they're going to be fairly small stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| and they're going to be more like dry cleaners, convenience stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| small privately owned style restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| There was a time in this country when you shopped at the neighborhood store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| where you went to the small neighborhood restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| These days, it's getting to the point where everything you go to is a big box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10324)|
| 2:52:11| It's a Walmart or a Super Target or a Super Walmart or a restaurant that there's every exit you stop at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10331)|
| 2:52:20| and there's the same restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| It just looks to me like this concept is going back to where you shop close to home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10345)|
| 2:52:31| where you eat close to home, that will open up opportunities for smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10351)|
| 2:52:38| more mom and pop style businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| And I admire that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| I'm a big fan of mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| It looks like what you're doing here is creating some mixed use close to some existing residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10364)|
| 2:52:54| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| I mean, you know, the way I always kind of looked at it is, and this is not a slam on this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10375)|
| 2:53:01| but I always envisioned it as being kind of like a Rocky Hill done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| And that's not saying, you know, a bad thing about Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| It's about the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| But how that area has progressed over time, it's been hard to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| You know, you have one building over here, and then you have another one over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| and then a few years later you get another use over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| It's just been hard to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| But the feel of Rocky Hill, that area, you know, you get a Butler & Bailey in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| and you get a little hardware store in that area, and you get a salon, you know, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10408)|
| 2:53:35| But we have an opportunity here, and I think the NPC had mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| We've got an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| I know, again, that the size is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| But the reality of it is they're trying to contain all of the commercial to one corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| You know, if we could contain it to that area, put only what the people need in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| and prevent the commercial sprawl, which is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| You know, if we can get our arms around this thing, have it good and architecturally monitored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| we've got to come back through again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| If we move a blade of grass in this thing, we're going to have to come back through for a use-owner view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| Yeah, it sounds like what you're talking about, though, we're talking about 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10453)|
| 2:54:18| It sounds like, you know, we're really talking about six acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| and then preserving some green space that will enhance the value of the six that's untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10462)|
| 2:54:29| And I know it looks, when we look at this and we're looking at 15 acres, oh, my Lord, 15 acres of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| well, it's six acres and it's neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| And the truth is, is that in the process we're also preserving this other green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| I really like what you're doing and I'm going to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| and I hope some of my colleagues will join me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| I want to make a few comments, you know, both for the people out in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| and then also for other commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| I've put a lot of energy in on this thing, just like many of you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| You know, I had lunch one day with Bobby and another homeowner person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| Of course, I've met with John Huber before on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| I was at the Greenways meeting out at the clubhouse at Montgomery Cove on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| talked with Jim McEvers, who's spoken here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| So I've really tried to listen to what people have to say about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| I even met with Mr. Weigel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| And one of the concerns that I've had out there is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| what happens if this development is not successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| You know, what if Mr. Weigel is wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| Are we going to have an abandoned building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| Because there's nothing more obtrusive in a neighborhood than to have an abandoned gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| And I asked him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| He started building stores in the early 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| And I think what he said, I may be off on my numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| but I think he's built 57 stores in Knox County and four stores outside of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10557)|
| 2:56:03| and none of them have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| You know, I asked him how this store, it's the same thing that Bobby brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| I asked him about this particular store, what would be different here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| And the stores really are different than those on Kingston Pike is that there's no backlit signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| You know, those are the signs that stick up high that have light behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| The signs are on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| They're limited in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| It's what they call indirect lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| Also something that's a little bit different than these other stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| these things are going to be made out of brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| So I think that Mr. Weigel, as he said, when I started building these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| I didn't know what I was doing, and now he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| You know, one of the things that I've considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| and one of the ladies brought this up also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| dealt with what's going to happen if we don't put something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| And it's zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| There was the mention of putting condos there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| And we've sat here I don't know how many times and looked at the proposals for condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:04| and they want to put, you know, six to nine units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| If you put seven units, I did a little math here, if you put seven units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| you're talking about 105 houses basically on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:19| And just like Mr. Huber said, they cram those things in just as tight as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| It's concrete and brick or wood or whatever they make these out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:31| And I don't think that's real good on that neighborhood, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| You know, quite frankly, if you asked me what I would like to see 20 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| I'd say let's keep it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| But, unfortunately, that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| And I think when we look at this, we have to decide what's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10663)|
| 2:57:49| You know, we're not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| I hate this saying you can't stop progress, but we're not going to stop development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| I mean, it's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| And what five, 10, 15 years from now, what is going to be the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10677)|
| 2:58:04| it may not be the thing that we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| but what's going to be the thing that we can tolerate the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| that is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes, that fits in with the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| Do we want 105 condos on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| You know, what hurts property values more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| What's more pleasing to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| What causes more traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| And, you know, the other thing that we see all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| and I've already mentioned about the stormwater, I always have doubts about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| And I was at the stormwater meeting that we had last week also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| I think Commissioner Tony Norman was there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| There may have been a few others, but I listened to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| And I believe that they can control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| And then the final question I always ask is what about the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| Is this a guy we can trust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| We sit up here every month and listen to problems from citizens about water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| We listen to citizens about people not doing what they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10734)|
| 2:58:59| And I know developers, at least as far as homeowners, because I feel the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10739)|
| 2:59:04| you know, we don't always trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| But, you know, I do have to say that Mr. Huber, I've been through his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| I've gone out and driven through his project at Covered Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| Did he do what he said he was going to do out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| I've talked to people that live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| And I haven't talked to a lot of people that have really felt that they were misled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| or betrayed by what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| So just to summarize, you know, what I was going to say on this is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| what is it going to look like if we don't put something in there where every building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| they put in they have to go back to the NPC to get their input where neighbors can come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| and look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| What are we going to have there if we don't control this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| And that's the thing I'm struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| I know people have been asking me all week, how are you going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| How are you going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| You know, I mean, I've struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| I'm not sure now how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| But I'm just trying to look down the line about what's going to be best from that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| I will say that the one hooker deals with this traffic from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| I thought that was a good point that someone brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| but I don't know what we can do about that other than if that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| we just have to put the money out there to fix that intersection because that needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| And, you know, I'll commit to everybody here that I'll do whatever I can to work with the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10812)|
| 3:00:19| But anyway, these are just the things that I've been going through in my mind is trying to look further down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| and what can we live with best if we look at what all the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| Because I think one option that we're not going to see 10 or 12 or 15 years from now is for that to be a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10830)|
| 3:00:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| Most of what Dr. Briggs had to say I would just agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| and especially the part where we have to look at the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:56| And I think Mr. Huber certainly has a reputation that's well known in this county as being one that does value the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10856)|
| 3:01:08| He has a wonderful example in Covered Bridge of the type of development where he did what he said he was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10868)|
| 3:01:17| And the proposal that he has before us, we keep using the term sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10877)|
| 3:01:25| I think it is an example of sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10885)|
| 3:01:30| And it must be our planners, our professional planners, who staff the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10890)|
| 3:01:40| they are oriented, as far as I can tell, to that sort of foundational principle now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10900)|
| 3:01:48| That's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10908)|
| 3:01:49| That's what they seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| And so I think the plan that's been presented, the types of protections that exist for aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10911)|
| 3:02:07| and buffers and the environmental concerns are certainly to be commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10927)|
| 3:02:13| I think probably it will be the most restricted commercial development in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10933)|
| 3:02:22| and it will be one that will be a model for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:28| And that's what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| We still have a considerable amount of undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| Certainly, we need to be very restrictive in how it's used, and this is an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10954)|
| 3:02:39| I do have a question or two, probably for you, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| In the process of the staff hashing this out and voting to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10965)|
| 3:02:54| and Mr. Huber has already alluded to this, but I just wanted to get some of your explanations also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10974)|
| 3:03:02| And that is the notion that this development, although it's fairly large in total scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10982)|
| 3:03:10| is fairly relatively modest in terms of its footprint on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10990)|
| 3:03:17| and the orientation of the development is internal rather than external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=10997)|
| 3:03:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| I think that's probably a fair way to characterize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| Of course, we haven't approved any plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| Of course, we've already noted that those are under postponement right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| But what we have seen and what we think we're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| and what we're going to encourage by the review of that conceptual plan with each time a piece comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11024)|
| 3:03:51| is to continue to see that in terms of trying to create a small neighborhood node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| or village where you have these various small neighborhood uses that can share parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11038)|
| 3:04:05| that you can walk to and from, and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11045)|
| 3:04:09| You know, when I mentioned the term pedestrian access, you know, the point taken about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11049)|
| 3:04:16| well, nobody's going to walk to it from way down south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| But there may be, with the surrounding property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| there may be a possibility with the greenway and with other pieces that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| that we can begin to see those little small connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| where people can actually walk to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11076)|
| 3:04:37| And certainly you considered Mr. Akert's design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11077)|
| 3:04:42| or his idea about a Weigel's and a two-acre site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| and residential and the other adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| But when you all discussed that, you expressly went towards something different from that, I assume, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11090)|
| 3:05:00| for the reasons you've already stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11100)|
| 3:05:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| Having a small neighborhood, two-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11106)|
| 3:05:09| with the rest of the property being developed residentially, you all considered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:15| but this is not within your idea to reduce commercial sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11115)|
| 3:05:23| And that's the concept, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| You're trying to promote a concentration of commercial activity into a relatively small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| In fact, I believe we stated in the staff report that we've already pretty much put ourselves out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11134)|
| 3:05:41| We're not going to be too favorable to expanding this particular center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11141)|
| 3:05:46| In other words, somebody is going to have to have some real, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| bang-up plan that, you know, shoots the moon for even us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| Because what the applicant has proposed is a concentrated node right there at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11155)|
| 3:06:02| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11162)|
| 3:06:03| The other three you can't develop on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| But you can develop on this one quadrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| And it's a focused, concentrated location of fairly low intense commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11167)|
| 3:06:14| If he had pursued trying to do more of a mix with residential and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11174)|
| 3:06:21| we would have been very open to that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| We're open to this concept, the 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| There's no CN zone does not prescribe an upper maximum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11187)|
| 3:06:35| Granted, and I'm glad I was corrected with the research that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| that they've been more in the area of two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| It does not prescribe a maximum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11202)|
| 3:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| But the fact that you have a little bit larger size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| you can do something with this site that you can't do in other situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11212)|
| 3:06:57| where you can look at how the several uses can relate to each other, share parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11217)|
| 3:07:04| make use of green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| those kinds of things that you don't normally see in a lot of commercial developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11226)|
| 3:07:13| John, I just had one other question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:17| The only hitch that I see for me then is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| and sort of it speaks to Mr. King's mention of why not to defer or postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11241)|
| 3:07:29| And I still have trouble with the traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11249)|
| 3:07:34| And so for those of us that are not familiar with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11254)|
| 3:07:40| how do you feel like this is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| How are you going to handle the traffic issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| How are you going to handle the hump and the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| How do you feel confident that that's going to be developed into something that works for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11271)|
| 3:08:00| Well, I think it's probably, as Mr. Weitrich said, it's almost like first things first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11280)|
| 3:08:07| We're trying to unfold this plan in a reasonable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| We did have one traffic study done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11292)|
| 3:08:17| and it indicated that for the first tenant, which would be a Weigel's convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| that we needed to lower that vertical curve or the blind hill coming in to the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| make some road improvements with the widening, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| So we're absolutely committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| The next phase, you know, we're just going to take it as it comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11314)|
| 3:08:39| and that's going to be getting into the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| You know, I have told Mr. Weitrich that we would be happy to help with funding with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11322)|
| 3:08:49| You know, it is an issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| I think that's been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| It's been an issue for 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| You know, I mean, there's nothing new happening today that wasn't happening 20, 30 years ago out on that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| We're going to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| We're going to make it safer, increase the site distance, widen the road out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| Now, you know, we're probably looking at even possibly having another traffic study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| once we get a real handle on exactly how the concept plan comes into play with the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11349)|
| 3:09:18| Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11358)|
| 3:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11362)|
| 3:09:23| I just wanted to say this has been a really difficult, as all the other commissioners have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11363)|
| 3:09:30| something that I've really struggled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| But I do appreciate the reputation that you have as a developer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11372)|
| 3:09:41| And some of the things that have been very important to me as I've considered this is that these are the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11381)|
| 3:09:48| developments that we've been asking for in terms of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| And if a developer with an excellent reputation comes to us with what we've been asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11394)|
| 3:10:00| and we tell them no, what kind of message are we sending to all the other developers in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11400)|
| 3:10:09| I'm not in favor of a two-acre development in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| because then you wind up with half a mile down the road another two-acre development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11414)|
| 3:10:19| and then a mile down the road another two-acre development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| I think that what we need to be moving towards are the kind of concentrated, low-impact developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11424)|
| 3:10:37| where we can reduce our dependency on automobiles to get the things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11437)|
| 3:10:43| So those are some of the things that I think I thought long and hard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:52| as well as I understand the opposition and the desire to keep things the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11452)|
| 3:10:59| But development is going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| This is going to be less damaging to that area, I think, than condos or more residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11461)|
| 3:11:12| So it's not without a great deal of thought that I vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11472)|
| 3:11:17| But I do appreciate all of the residents who have come out on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| I appreciate hearing from everybody over the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| It means a lot to the commissioners when we hear from the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| And I hope that we'll continue to hear from you as this goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11492)|
| 3:11:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11503)|
| 3:11:46| Bud's already got on me over here about why am I going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| Well, I've got an investment in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| Twenty-five years or so ago, when I did a little bit more at Knoxville Track Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11512)|
| 3:11:57| or the Tennessee Wheelman than I've done lately, my son and I were out in that area frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11517)|
| 3:12:05| It's because there were a lot of 5K, 10K, 50-mile bike rides and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:10| It's because it's a good rural road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| With the phone calls, cards, and letters that this has generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| and we seem to have a lot of conversation about it here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| I thought that it would be best that this would be one of those that I'll load up the little woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| and we're off to Concord or North Shore or Chota Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11549)|
| 3:12:35| And there's another reason to be there also because I hadn't been there in some 20 years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11555)|
| 3:12:41| The school is also proposing purchasing property in that area, so I made a twofer out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| Really, it turned into a threefer because, well, there's 76-mile for my round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11567)|
| 3:12:57| There's the school board sites that I looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| And then we stopped in Turkey Creek and ate at the Red Robin, which was a good meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| So it was a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| I think what this illustrates, though, is the fact that there has been change in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| I observed where I thought that I had ridden for miles on a bicycle and not seen anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11595)|
| 3:13:22| There are now lots of residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| What I'm saying is that, you know, it's the absolute opposite end of the county from where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11604)|
| 3:13:33| but change has taken place and this change might not be too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| If nobody in the Fifth District wants to make a motion to approve, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11627)|
| 3:13:51| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11632)|
| 3:13:53| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11633)|
| 3:13:58| Both items, right, per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| If nobody in the Fifth District wants to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11645)|
| 3:14:10| No, you made the motion, and so I think it would be proper for everybody to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11653)|
| 3:14:14| But I first said if nobody wants to do it, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| I don't like jumping out of districts, but we've talked about this for, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11656)|
| 3:14:23| We have another light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| Commissioner Smith, you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| I just want to say just real quick, I wanted to, with Mr. Hubbard there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| I've voted on issues with him for this is my twelfth year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11671)|
| 3:14:34| and he and I have not seen eye to eye on a lot of things, and I've not always voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| But I think you're well planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| But I really want to commend Mr. Weigels, what you have continued to do in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11680)|
| 3:14:46| how you continue to build, how you continue to give back to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| I mean, when this gentleman showed up, the print up here, what you're proposing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11690)|
| 3:14:56| we'd love to have that in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11696)|
| 3:14:58| I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| That's really you are setting a standard on the convenience stores that you build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11700)|
| 3:15:05| You do first class work, and I applaud you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| And, Mr. Hubbard, I look forward to your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| We'll take that in the Third District, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| How about in your backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11713)|
| 3:15:14| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| How about your backyard, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| I put horses in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:18| It looked great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| How about in Kentucky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11719)|
| 3:15:20| We have a motion on the floor to approve our NPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11720)|
| 3:15:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11727)|
| 3:15:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| And we have one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11731)|
| 3:15:37| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11737)|

| 3:16:46| requesting that the Knox County Law Director's Office exercise all legal means available to recover public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11806)|
| 3:16:54| allocated to have been misappropriated by Knox County's trustee employee, John Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| This is Resolution 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| Yes, I'd like for Mr. Jarrett to give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| He's had a conversation with Mr. Hahn's attorney as well as the Attorney General today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| If you would give us that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, based upon those conversations today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| both with John Gill with the Attorney General's Office and Mr. John Valiant, legal counsel for Mr. Hahn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11837)|
| 3:17:25| I've been advised that in order to make full and complete restitution, if we will, to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| Mr. Hahn will be assigning any and all monies due and owing him as a result of his service to Knox County by way of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11850)|
| 3:17:37| And any monies that does not cover will be made up by a loan he has acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11857)|
| 3:17:45| I don't have a date yet, but that is what I was informed by both attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11865)|
| 3:17:53| So, Mr. Chairman, my resolution basically as a result of this is asking our law director to stay on top of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| and make sure that that restitution is forthcoming and that it is complete in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11879)|
| 3:18:04| So I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11887)|
| 3:18:08| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| Being an employee of the Knox County Trustee's Office, I'm going to have to recuse myself on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11890)|
| 3:18:19| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11899)|
| 3:18:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11902)|

| 3:19:19| It ought to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11959)|
| 3:19:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11960)|
| 3:19:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11961)|
| 3:19:22| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11962)|

| 3:19:38| He's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| Is there someone else for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| I think this is going to be a fun one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| No Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| Nobody for public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| Mueller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11990)|
| 3:19:51| Many, many moons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11991)|
| 3:19:52| Are we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| We have other business report and discussion regarding stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=11993)|
| 3:20:07| Gentlemen and ladies, I guess the first thing I'd like to talk about is we have been talking about Ms. Cole's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12007)|
| 3:20:15| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| And one of the things that I thought would be helpful to us would be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| I just had a meeting with Mr. Weedtrick, Mr. Grangeau, Mr. Ragsdale, Dwight VanDeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12022)|
| 3:20:32| and we talked about her issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| At the end of it, I thought that one thing that would be helpful, there's damage, no doubt damage has been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12034)|
| 3:20:43| possibly is continuing to be done for things that are very difficult to get a handle on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| So what I thought would be helpful, hopefully would be helpful to Ms. Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12048)|
| 3:20:55| and give her some assurance that the county intends to improve in terms of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12055)|
| 3:21:03| and stormwater issues into the future would be to talk about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12063)|
| 3:21:09| So the future is not the development of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| It's the Graysburg phase two, which is, you know, which is in the planning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| So what Mr. Weedtrick and Mr. Grangeau agreed with several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12076)|
| 3:21:23| These were kind of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| One was that the new ordinance requirements would be in effect for Graysburg phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12084)|
| 3:21:33| not the original, the old stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12093)|
| 3:21:39| Ms. Cole would be notified as soon as that process took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12099)|
| 3:21:43| and she would be kept abreast of issues of any of the stormwater plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| issues related to Graysburg phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| Also, the stormwater department was agreeable to develop baseline data for turbidity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12112)|
| 3:22:02| and volume within her affected stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12122)|
| 3:22:06| So there will be a way for her to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12126)|
| 3:22:09| and possibly we'll be able to compare should some of the requirements of the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12129)|
| 3:22:18| or new stormwater ordinance not be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12138)|
| 3:22:23| Certainly we'll have some quantifiable, hopefully, ways of comparing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12143)|
| 3:22:29| So that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| We met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12151)|
| 3:22:32| Those were the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| And then I just wanted to report those to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12154)|
| 3:22:39| Does anybody have questions regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| And then I have one other thing to say about stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12165)|
| 3:22:46| Then the other thing, of course, the Stormwater Review Committee has met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12166)|
| 3:22:51| and the first meeting, the first full meeting of the committee was a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12171)|
| 3:22:58| and Mr. Grange, you covered background material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| and reviewed the stormwater ordinance for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| And, of course, we had questions and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12185)|
| 3:23:08| and discussion related to some of the parts of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12188)|
| 3:23:12| And we're compiling those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| and we'll have a report back concerning those things here for the commission later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12195)|
| 3:23:22| The next meeting will be in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| You'll be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| to do a similar type of review of their regulatory structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12210)|
| 3:23:34| and how it affects Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12214)|
| 3:23:37| So that's the meeting scheduled in February, and you'll be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12217)|
| 3:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12221)|
| 3:23:48| Discussion regarding the results of the peer review of the Knox County Internal Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12228)|
| 3:23:53| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12233)|
| 3:23:58| Refer to full commission, 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12238)|
| 3:24:00| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12240)|
| 3:24:05| Yes, refer to the commission, 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| All over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| Do you want to take this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Yeah, I'll start the discussion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| and with any input from Commissioner Saunders and Wright, if they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12255)|
| 3:24:21| I think we've got five items on here, and I'll try to be fairly brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12261)|
| 3:24:27| but touch on what the audit committee heard and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| Now, the first one is the peer review that was conducted of Mr. Walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12270)|
| 3:24:35| and his office by the ATA firm from Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12275)|
| 3:24:41| I think you've been supplied with a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| The first few items, I won't call them housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| but they said that Richard's office didn't comply with the reported language under government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12289)|
| 3:24:58| Auditing standards was not used in five or six audit projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| and they suggest he follow, basically stay by the book a little more closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| There was some mention of when, if there had been more communication between Richard's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12307)|
| 3:25:16| I'm just speaking in generalities, more communication between Richard's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| and certain areas he was auditing, this would be primarily the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| and some of the, well, I wouldn't say necessarily the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| all the departments of Knox County that are under the mayor's purview and direct control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12326)|
| 3:25:31| then they suggested that he have had more communication with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12331)|
| 3:25:38| and because of the various conflicts and ethics allegations and so forth that we're all aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12338)|
| 3:25:46| there wasn't enough communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| And I'll just sum up by the last and, I guess, most critical suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12349)|
| 3:25:56| and anyone, please join me if you have a comment on this or a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12356)|
| 3:26:01| It has received quite a bit of press, so I won't dwell on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:05| Let me mention one thing also besides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12365)|
| 3:26:10| They were critical and that's boxes and files containing work papers were voluminous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12370)|
| 3:26:14| but somewhat disorganized and that that could be in better order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| and there could be cross-referencing in case people ever need to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| and so how did this, how was this audit conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| and where did you get this data and that data and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:30| And item five under the objectivity, again, this is the one that's gotten the most public scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| and press and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| The majority of the audit activity of the Knox County Auditor's Office for the period that was examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12399)|
| 3:26:45| was confined to engagements affecting primarily the executive offices of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| and to somewhat to Mr. Wall's credit or, I don't, best way I could put it, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12410)|
| 3:26:58| he did this at the direction of representatives of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12418)|
| 3:27:03| Actually, he was directed by county commissioners to go look at this area in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12423)|
| 3:27:08| or that area of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| Again, I'm being broad in that term of saying the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12430)|
| 3:27:14| These were things that were under the direct control of the mayor's office or indirect control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12434)|
| 3:27:22| And the recommendation was that care should be taken to not unduly focus the attention of the auditor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| on one area or one elected official of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| especially when the resulting audits may appear to be politically motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12450)|
| 3:27:36| In some cases, the Knox County Audit Committee determines narrowly focused audits are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| The reasons for that determination should be appropriately documented in the minutes of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12461)|
| 3:27:46| and we are now having our minutes transcribed so that we can refer back to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12466)|
| 3:27:52| if anyone ever has a question about that or the objectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12472)|
| 3:27:58| And, again, I'm not editorializing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| I'm just sort of reading the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12481)|
| 3:28:02| So, I mean, I know some of my colleagues here may disagree with these findings, and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| and some of the audience may think they're not critical enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:14| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12494)|
| 3:28:21| I know it's sort of late in the evening, but Director Walz or Saunders or anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12501)|
| 3:28:28| I mean, I'd like for you, the members of the Audit Committee, to speak first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| but if you have anything else to add before I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| I'm sorry that I was away there for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| I had a phone call from the resigning school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12519)|
| 3:28:45| Would you like to share that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| Is he still resigning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| Well, yes, I assume he's still resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| What I was going to say was that one of the comments that I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12532)|
| 3:28:57| if it might take just a moment to share what Bill Phillips just shared with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12537)|
| 3:29:07| I don't know whether or not he left us under the cordial list enough terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12547)|
| 3:29:12| but I believe that's between him and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12552)|
| 3:29:16| I spoke my piece about what I thought Bill Phillips ought to do several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| and I have not been for him or against him in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12560)|
| 3:29:26| I think that when he stood up today and said that he now thinks that he should have resigned back when it occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12566)|
| 3:29:33| well, I would agree with him that that's when he should have resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12573)|
| 3:29:37| But having resigned today I think was the correct thing for him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12577)|
| 3:29:42| I think he's doing the right thing for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12582)|
| 3:29:45| I believe he marginalized the office, he realized what was taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12585)|
| 3:29:50| because there were a lot of people against him, not enough to get him ousted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| but he was a big enough person to take it on, look at it logically today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12594)|
| 3:30:01| and do what he thought was best for the 8th District, and I applaud him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12601)|
| 3:30:05| Now then, talking about the audit committee, I've seen these over whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12605)|
| 3:30:12| we were here four or five or six hours the other day receiving audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| and there were things that were criticized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12617)|
| 3:30:20| There were things that we were actually complimented for what we had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12620)|
| 3:30:26| I believe that just to hit one or two things, the thing that struck me most importantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12626)|
| 3:30:32| is something that we, the audit committee, will have to hand on over to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12632)|
| 3:30:37| is like on the special funds, what was that audit called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| The audit of activity funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| Yes, Nassau County School Activity Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| They say they find some of the same items reoccurring, but never the same school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12647)|
| 3:30:54| never the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| People fix their problems, it's just there's a turnover in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| and this audit occurs every year, and for what might have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| there was a shortcoming this year, could happen again next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12665)|
| 3:31:08| but it happens at a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12668)|
| 3:31:10| So as the audits go, I think I carried one in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12670)|
| 3:31:23| If you didn't get to see the big one for the last physical year, then there's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12683)|
| 3:31:32| Yes, there is a recap of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| I think we've been provided a disc of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| I thought Dave was going to read the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| I lost my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| I can't read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| I'm sure that as a member of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12708)|
| 3:31:51| I hope that we're doing the best possible service for the full commission that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12711)|
| 3:31:59| I do not view it as a need for the full commission to sit through this additional six hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12719)|
| 3:32:06| and I think that I feel good about what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| and I feel good about other commissioners sitting on other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12731)|
| 3:32:15| So that's sort of a shared leaning on each other, and I hope we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12735)|
| 3:32:20| So if ever there's a question about what's taking place before the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12740)|
| 3:32:26| I think you've got two paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| You speak to one of the fellow commissioners that is there through the appropriate channel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12749)|
| 3:32:35| or you just come to the meeting and see what it is that we've got going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| Now, I'll entertain any question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12761)|
| 3:32:44| I will touch on the school audit, the other audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| Yes, I don't have any questions, but just a couple of observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:51| First of all, I think you're doing a great job on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| and thank you for your service today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| I think the audit committee is functioning well, and I think this is money well spent to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| I guess my only concern about this audit and the school audit is that when we have these findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12780)|
| 3:33:06| and there are some good things, but when you see things that need to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12786)|
| 3:33:11| what actions can we take to make sure that things are being improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12791)|
| 3:33:16| How can we make sure that findings are being implemented, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| I think there's a good one here with regards to independence of the staff, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12800)|
| 3:33:25| Should we have a yearly signed statement saying that they're – I mean, I'm just throwing these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| We don't need to discuss or decide this today, but I'm just saying these are some findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| And so as we look at these findings, I would just challenge the audit committee to come up with a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| where these things are being addressed and then report back to us that, indeed, they have been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| and that the problems or any issues have been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12822)|
| 3:33:47| Mike, I believe we have invited the school to send a representative to talk about exactly those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12827)|
| 3:33:53| at our next audit committee, so we are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12833)|
| 3:33:56| That was going to be my response also, that, of course, there is another level of elected officials over that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| that being the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| Dr. McIntyre is aware of this and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12844)|
| 3:34:06| I've discussed it with some of his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| Some of the things are, to me, barely merit being in here, but, nevertheless, technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12849)|
| 3:34:16| people had funds deposited at credit union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| I mean, goodness, credit union is as safe as a bike, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| but technically the statute says they should be at savings and loan associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12861)|
| 3:34:27| bank charter institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| So that's being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| One thing that does sort of jump out at me is the ticket reconciliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12871)|
| 3:34:37| This would be like an athletic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| You could see the propensity for, if hundreds if not thousands of people were walking through a gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12879)|
| 3:34:44| some guys handing out tickets and taking in $5 bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12884)|
| 3:34:47| that if there's not a reconciliation audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12887)|
| 3:34:50| there would be a great margin for some to slide in somebody's pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12890)|
| 3:34:55| and not necessarily go to the school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12895)|
| 3:34:58| But that's being addressed by a number of tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12898)|
| 3:35:03| and I will assure you that we will make sure the school board and Dr. McIntyre's staff addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12903)|
| 3:35:11| Fundraising, there were some instances where the money was raised at the schools as in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12911)|
| 3:35:17| I've got 12-year-old sons and every two weeks he comes in, hey, let's buy this or buy that or take photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12917)|
| 3:35:23| If they spend $30 on photographs at the school, the school gets nine or ten bucks off it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12923)|
| 3:35:28| Well, that goes into a fund that the school should benefit the students at that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12928)|
| 3:35:33| but some of the money was going to a teacher welfare fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12933)|
| 3:35:36| or being spent for teacher welfare purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12936)|
| 3:35:39| That sort of sounds a little shady, but really it's for buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12939)|
| 3:35:42| I asked some people at the schools, what does that go for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12942)|
| 3:35:45| It goes for buying flowers when a teacher's relative dies or when a teacher goes to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12945)|
| 3:35:52| So it's not like teacher's welfare retirement fund or sending a teacher to the beach fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| It's for purposes that should be addressed, but not necessarily with student funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12958)|
| 3:36:06| These things are high on the radar screen, and our audit committee is what existed for about 13 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12966)|
| 3:36:16| So we're not an old institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| We're still learning as we go along, but I assure you we will stay on top of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12978)|
| 3:36:23| and make sure that there's some improvement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| And as David said, it's this school west and it's that school north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12986)|
| 3:36:32| It moves around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12992)|
| 3:36:33| It's not one school continuously doing something that hits the auditor's radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=12993)|
| 3:36:40| And lastly, the biggest audit, the one we've got on here and in the book there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| they've got size of a phone book, that was the best audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| We got a good response from KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13009)|
| 3:36:54| And Dr. Carsello asked, I think he said put us on a percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13014)|
| 3:36:59| He didn't say one to ten, but, you know, what percentile is the Knox County Finance Office would they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13019)|
| 3:37:07| And how high were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| Upper quartile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| Upper quartile, which is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| That's a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13033)|
| 3:37:14| You know, that's competing with some very reputable people nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13034)|
| 3:37:20| I think items four and five are discussion items from the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13040)|
| 3:37:26| I'm going to defer to Mike Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13046)|
| 3:37:28| And thank you, Mike, for sitting through six and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| This is regarding the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| We're charged with establishing an employee hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13053)|
| 3:37:37| Before we get to that, I was going to recognize Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13057)|
| 3:37:41| He had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13061)|
| 3:37:42| And, Commissioner Pinkston, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13062)|
| 3:37:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13064)|
| 3:37:45| I wanted to comment on a statement that Mr. Shouse made there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| Commissioner Shouse made about it looked like these things might have been used politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13067)|
| 3:37:52| You know, Richard had nothing to do with anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13072)|
| 3:37:57| He came out on the P cards at county commission that they were buying personal items and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13077)|
| 3:38:02| So he had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| The travel allowance came out as disguise compensation because we were furnishing them a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| They said they used that to buy personal items like cigars and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13088)|
| 3:38:14| We furnished them a car, and yet they were getting allowance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| The hospitality account, there was nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| But when these wrongdoings, Ed, and you've been in the banking business, financial business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13100)|
| 3:38:24| you should know that when you find a discrepancy like that, or this auditing firm should know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13104)|
| 3:38:30| you have to check it out, and then one thing just leads to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13110)|
| 3:38:33| and you just keep getting deeper and deeper in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| So I don't feel like anything was political on Richard or any of the commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13115)|
| 3:38:40| because all these things came out on county commission, and he had no choice but to audit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13120)|
| 3:38:47| I understand your point of view, and let me emphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| They had used politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| He didn't just go in there and hunt for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| These things were exposed to where he needed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13133)|
| 3:38:56| I would just emphasize, again, I did not editorialize on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13136)|
| 3:39:00| I just quoted from what the auditor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| He used the words politically motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| Those weren't my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13144)|
| 3:39:05| I was quoting from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| But I do understand your viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13147)|
| 3:39:10| He says it may appear to be politically motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13150)|
| 3:39:12| He didn't say specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13152)|
| 3:39:17| We paid him to give his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13157)|
| 3:39:18| It's like an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13158)|
| 3:39:20| Some of us like an attorney's opinion and some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| But he gave it to us, and that was his opinion, that there was an appearance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13163)|
| 3:39:27| And I just quoted from what we paid to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13167)|
| 3:39:35| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13175)|
| 3:39:36| Yes, you can proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13176)|
| 3:39:37| The fourth and fifth item on the discussion from the audit committee in regards to the audit hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13177)|
| 3:39:46| and we've had vendors in for the last two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13186)|
| 3:39:51| And it's a simple process, but a fairly complex process, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:56| you could have crank calls and people with vendettas and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13196)|
| 3:40:04| And let me defer to Mike, and he's versed on this more than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13204)|
| 3:40:10| Thank you, Commissioner Schalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13210)|
| 3:40:14| Mike Reeves, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street, Suite 100, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13214)|
| 3:40:22| Commissioner Strickland, commissioners, in the interest of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13222)|
| 3:40:29| I will kind of go through a brief timeline of events, sequence of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13229)|
| 3:40:35| of where we started with this and where we are at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13235)|
| 3:40:40| and what we hope to consider when the proposals are received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13240)|
| 3:40:48| Back in September, September 1st specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13248)|
| 3:40:52| I was instructed by the audit committee to set up a presentation at the November 3rd meeting for a hotline system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13252)|
| 3:41:04| I had understood that Mr. Wall's department had had some contact with a couple of companies that did this type of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13264)|
| 3:41:19| and they had kind of started the ball rolling by making some unofficial contacts with them to speak with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13279)|
| 3:41:27| and get some names, and, Richard, I appreciate that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13287)|
| 3:41:31| The names of the two companies were The Network and Global Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13291)|
| 3:41:36| And so what I did, I made contact with both of those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13296)|
| 3:41:41| Chairman Carcello felt it necessary to have them come to the November 3rd meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:48| and give a presentation as well as a cost offer of what their services were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13308)|
| 3:41:54| and what they could provide to Knox County in the form of a hotline system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13314)|
| 3:42:04| They did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13324)|
| 3:42:05| They came and they gave a really nice, it was a short presentation, but I thought it was to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13325)|
| 3:42:12| It was a good PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13332)|
| 3:42:15| And we asked them to give us a cost offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| Each one of those cost offers were over $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13339)|
| 3:42:23| That would include a one-time set-up fee, an annual cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13343)|
| 3:42:28| and the number of what they call, both of these companies call case managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13348)|
| 3:42:33| which basically handle the cases, the incoming calls on their end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13353)|
| 3:42:40| Normally, an entity of this size probably would use one, two, maybe three case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13360)|
| 3:42:47| Obviously, there's a cost associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13367)|
| 3:42:50| Very few entities of our size would use unlimited case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13370)|
| 3:42:56| Obviously, there's a cost associated with one versus an unlimited amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13376)|
| 3:43:02| So we asked them to kind of give us a cost based upon that history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13382)|
| 3:43:07| Using the assumption of one case manager, as I said, the cost exceeded $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13387)|
| 3:43:14| I informed the Audit Committee and Chairman Carcello at that point in time what our options were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13394)|
| 3:43:20| based upon the procurement regulations that we operate under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13400)|
| 3:43:24| From that discussion, the Audit Committee asked Purchasing Department, specifically myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13404)|
| 3:43:32| to put together and draft an RFP, which I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| and to have that RFP sent to all Audit Committee members prior to our January 5th Audit Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:46| to which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| I presented a draft copy and sent it to all members of the Audit Committee and copied Mr. Troyer also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13427)|
| 3:44:00| Basically, I got up before the committee and discussed that particular project, what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13440)|
| 3:44:08| Just to kind of give you very quickly a brief idea of the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13448)|
| 3:44:14| or the objectives of what we're trying to get across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| there was basically four objectives that we were trying to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| that most any hotline company will tell you this is the reason for our being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13462)|
| 3:44:28| Number one, provide an anonymous third-party reporting mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13468)|
| 3:44:33| for specifically Knox County government's employees and or citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13473)|
| 3:44:39| It's not just restricted to Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| It's also inclusive of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| Number two, to reduce the losses from illegal or unethical activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13485)|
| 3:44:52| And number three is to protect the anonymity of whistleblowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:56| and Knox County government employees, including Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13496)|
| 3:45:00| There has to be a mechanism in place for that type of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13500)|
| 3:45:06| Number four, to promote ethical practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13506)|
| 3:45:10| Those were the four specific objectives and scope of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13510)|
| 3:45:15| We tried to determine from that scope of the work, well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13515)|
| 3:45:22| There's three important components of an RFP or any type of bid you put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13522)|
| 3:45:27| One, the scope needs to be fully presented and understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13527)|
| 3:45:32| And from basically I pulled that information from the composite of both of these presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13532)|
| 3:45:39| So I think the scope is clearly understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:43| Two, we need to have a way to effectively evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13543)|
| 3:45:47| So basically what I did was put together what I thought were areas that would effectively evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13547)|
| 3:45:55| In other words, tell us how to go about doing our, how they would go about doing their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13555)|
| 3:46:01| and assigning point totals to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13561)|
| 3:46:04| That information I presented to the audit committee in that draft RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13564)|
| 3:46:09| and I'm glad to say I had no ownership to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13569)|
| 3:46:13| And whatever they wanted to change, they could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| And they made no changes, so that was fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13576)|
| 3:46:19| The third component that's really important is the response component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| How well did they present the information based upon the award criteria that would help Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13584)|
| 3:46:32| and the evaluation team specifically for this project to effectively evaluate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13592)|
| 3:46:39| was really the three important components of the scope of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13599)|
| 3:46:46| As I said, the audit committee unanimously voted to proceed with the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13606)|
| 3:46:55| I actually released the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| I placed it on our website on January the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13618)|
| 3:47:02| I released it to the new Sentinel, which we're required by law to advertise out on the street for at least 21 business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13622)|
| 3:47:11| We're required to advertise in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13631)|
| 3:47:14| We actually advertise in three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| We put it in the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13636)|
| 3:47:17| We posted it on our website for national publication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13637)|
| 3:47:20| and it's posted in our purchasing offices on the wall when you come in on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13640)|
| 3:47:25| So we're actually in compliance three times rather than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13645)|
| 3:47:30| It's scheduled to open up on February the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13650)|
| 3:47:33| What we'll do is when we get opened up, I don't know how many responses we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13653)|
| 3:47:40| Judging from what we sent out, we'll certainly get two and maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13660)|
| 3:47:48| But those two companies are definitely interested in proposing to Knox County what they can do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13668)|
| 3:47:55| But basically what we'll do, we'll get them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13675)|
| 3:47:58| We'll assign them to the evaluation committee that we have established, which basically is the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13678)|
| 3:48:07| which would also include Mr. Troyer and myself as a purchasing representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13687)|
| 3:48:14| Those members there would constitute the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13694)|
| 3:48:18| I will charge the evaluation committee with their responsibilities, which basically is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13698)|
| 3:48:23| They're not to discuss it with anybody from the time that we leave to the time that we convene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13703)|
| 3:48:28| We stand alone in a court of law, so that's their instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13708)|
| 3:48:33| They're to score them based upon how well they submitted the information back in their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13713)|
| 3:48:39| From that, we'll come back as an evaluation team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13719)|
| 3:48:44| We'll independently give our scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13724)|
| 3:48:46| If we feel at that point in time that there's a number of responders that we need to short list, we reserve that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13726)|
| 3:48:52| We also reserve the right for oral interviews or product demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13732)|
| 3:48:57| We've already had two demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| There may be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13739)|
| 3:49:00| But all of those are pending in the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13740)|
| 3:49:06| Assuming all of those are done, then we will basically, we could ask them to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13746)|
| 3:49:11| and give us a final cost offer if we choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13751)|
| 3:49:15| So that would be part of the negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13755)|
| 3:49:18| Hopefully, we would come to a final consensus, which total points would rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13758)|
| 3:49:23| and we would come back and make a recommendation to you as commissioners as to the company that we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13763)|
| 3:49:34| consider you all to proceed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| And at that point in time, we would sit down with them and we would discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| They would come in and discuss with us the elements of how they would start it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13781)|
| 3:49:48| And at that point in time, that's when we control the process because we tell them how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13788)|
| 3:49:54| once they come in and interview us and the people involved with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| we tell them how we want it set up specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| which kind of leads us to that last point about the dissemination to the appropriate authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13801)|
| 3:50:07| We dictate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13807)|
| 3:50:10| They're going to tell us how they normally would go about doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13810)|
| 3:50:13| but they have a reporting process which has a chain of command of where the information would go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13813)|
| 3:50:21| But we dictate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13821)|
| 3:50:22| That's based upon our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13822)|
| 3:50:24| And I'll stop and ask if there are any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13824)|
| 3:50:27| That was quite thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13827)|
| 3:50:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| These were actually, although they were all on the audit committee as discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13830)|
| 3:50:36| they were actually entered in as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13836)|
| 3:50:38| So I'm going to ask the clerk to read all those that we have discussed so far just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13838)|
| 3:50:48| We still have a couple more to get to, even after the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| Discussion regarding the results of Roderick for Moss audit of the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13852)|
| 3:50:57| Discussion regarding the results of the KPMG audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13857)|
| 3:51:01| Discussion regarding the creation of an audit hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13861)|
| 3:51:05| Discussion regarding the procedures by which issues received by the audit hotline to be disseminated to the appropriate authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13865)|
| 3:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13874)|
| 3:51:15| And is there any further discussion on any of these audit issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13875)|
| 3:51:19| If not, we'll proceed on, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13882)|
| 3:51:23| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13883)|
| 3:51:24| Appreciate you hanging around for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13884)|
| 3:51:28| The next is discussion of the Knox County lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13888)|
| 3:51:33| Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we met today, myself and Commissioner Lambert and Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13893)|
| 3:51:39| and we just wanted to say the session is already underway as far as trying to hire someone right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13899)|
| 3:51:47| By the time we go through the process, the session is going to be half over anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| And so we wanted to see if it would be appropriate for us to look at for the budget year next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13910)|
| 3:51:57| of coming to you with criteria on what this lobbyist would do for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13917)|
| 3:52:02| whether we would take a look at what the cost would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13922)|
| 3:52:05| whether we would look at a short-term six-month deal or maybe a one-year deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13925)|
| 3:52:09| In other words, let us do some homework, come back to you before the budget year next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13929)|
| 3:52:14| and let's look at something for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| We are prepared to do that as a committee, but we would like for your instructions to us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| Or if you would like for us to just stop and not pursue it, then we will do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13942)|
| 3:52:26| But we wanted to see what your pleasure was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13946)|
| 3:52:29| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13949)|
| 3:52:30| I would like for you to have these lobbyists to send something to these commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13950)|
| 3:52:35| who are lobbying on something down there because we never know what they're even doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13955)|
| 3:52:39| whether they do anything or not on any bill that they're lobbying that we've sent down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13959)|
| 3:52:44| or the mayor or the administration has sent down to try to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13964)|
| 3:52:47| I'd like to know what they're doing for their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13967)|
| 3:52:51| I don't know of anything they've ever lobbied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13973)|
| 3:52:54| There have been a couple of things that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| But we're very happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| If the commission instructs the committee to do that, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13978)|
| 3:53:00| I think the commission should know what we're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| It would be nice to get updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13984)|
| 3:53:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13985)|
| 3:53:06| And we could set that as a criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13986)|
| 3:53:07| One thing that I want to make pretty clear is that we're talking about hiring a new lobbyist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13987)|
| 3:53:12| that represents commission, that directly works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13992)|
| 3:53:17| And if that's part of the criteria the rest of you would like for us to put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13997)|
| 3:53:22| we could make that one of the requirements when we put out a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14002)|
| 3:53:29| Anything further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14009)|
| 3:53:30| Well, do you want us to pursue this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| I mean, we're looking for a direction here on what you would like for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14012)|
| 3:53:35| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14015)|
| 3:53:36| I'd like for you to at least look at, for the budget year, maybe not right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| I kind of feel like there's going to be, if we go down to one commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14020)|
| 3:53:46| if the court finds that we stay at one commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| there's going to be savings in the commission budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14028)|
| 3:53:50| And I think that's something we could use a little bit of that money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14030)|
| 3:53:53| I don't want to use all of it because I think we need to trim a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14033)|
| 3:53:56| But maybe that's something we can look for in this next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14036)|
| 3:53:59| That's what I'd like for the committee to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| Is there a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14041)|
| 3:54:03| Do we have a lobbyist for this session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| Is it Chuck Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14045)|
| 3:54:06| The mayor's office has a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| The county commission does not have one per se for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| but we do have a Knox County lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14052)|
| 3:54:13| And it's Chuck Welch, who does represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14053)|
| 3:54:17| Well, I guess I'm hearing from the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14057)|
| 3:54:18| I'd like for us to pursue that, so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14058)|
| 3:54:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14062)|
| 3:54:24| Report from the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14064)|
| 3:54:28| Yes, just very quickly, the Ethics Committee met, I guess it was about maybe two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14068)|
| 3:54:35| it was about the middle of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14075)|
| 3:54:36| I don't remember the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14076)|
| 3:54:37| It was about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14077)|
| 3:54:39| To any extent, Elaine Davis brought up a point that I think we may want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14079)|
| 3:54:45| The background on this is that when we were selecting nominees for the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14085)|
| 3:54:51| one of the questions that we asked was, do you intend to run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14091)|
| 3:54:56| And are you running for office, and do you intend to run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14096)|
| 3:54:59| And I actually was the person that originated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14099)|
| 3:55:02| and we required all 20 or so of the applicants to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14102)|
| 3:55:08| Elaine brought up at the meeting that I not only have taken a petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14108)|
| 3:55:14| but I've turned my petition in, so I'm running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14114)|
| 3:55:17| And she questioned that since that seemed to be the feeling of the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14117)|
| 3:55:23| should I remain on the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14123)|
| 3:55:25| I talked briefly with Louis Cosby about that, and I don't know what his final decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14125)|
| 3:55:30| but I think if he indeed turns his petition in, he will resign from the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14130)|
| 3:55:36| I've already turned my petition in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14136)|
| 3:55:39| and I guess I'll leave it, as we say, to the wisdom of this board as to whether I explained to her when she asked for me to resign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14139)|
| 3:55:49| because I was running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14149)|
| 3:55:51| And I told her that my position was different than some of the others, is that it's really an ex officio position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14151)|
| 3:55:56| is that we have to have someone on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14156)|
| 3:55:59| And I think it was you, Commissioner Hammond, who one time before suggested that it be an all citizens board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14159)|
| 3:56:06| certainly with no connection to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14166)|
| 3:56:08| I hope I'm quoting you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| But to any extent, the longer I've sat there, the more that I agree completely with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14170)|
| 3:56:15| But our charter of the Ethics Committee does not allow that, and that I have to sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14175)|
| 3:56:20| And then Brian Standard is the representative from the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14180)|
| 3:56:24| and I will say that he has just been impeccable as far as doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14184)|
| 3:56:29| and I have nothing but admiration for the way he's conducted himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14189)|
| 3:56:33| But what Elaine suggested is that anyone running for office that actually turns the thing in should go ahead and resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14193)|
| 3:56:40| And, you know, according to how everyone feels about this, I would be willing to resign from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14200)|
| 3:56:46| She suggested that we appoint someone who is not running for office, which would be one of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14206)|
| 3:56:52| I think there's four people, I may be wrong, four or five people who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14212)|
| 3:56:57| Nate says he's going to run if that keeps him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14217)|
| 3:57:02| I'm not running, but don't put me on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14222)|
| 3:57:05| But, anyway, appoint someone to go ahead and hold my seat because we can elect somebody else after the elections in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14225)|
| 3:57:12| But to have someone, you know, someone that's not running for office take that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14232)|
| 3:57:18| and occupy it until after the election and then we can, the new commission can then nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14238)|
| 3:57:24| and vote on someone to take that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14244)|
| 3:57:29| I don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14249)|
| 3:57:30| Just speaking for myself, Mr. Briggs, I don't have a problem with you staying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14250)|
| 3:57:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14255)|
| 3:57:36| And I believe that if there was an issue that you felt you had a conflict because you're a candidate at this particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14256)|
| 3:57:46| I feel confident that you would recuse yourself from that particular vote and that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14266)|
| 3:57:52| And so I'm perfectly fine since we have to have a commissioner that you just stay on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14272)|
| 3:57:58| I'll tell you, my response to her is that, quite frankly, I agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14278)|
| 3:58:03| I mean, I wish we had all citizens on there, but we can't by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14283)|
| 3:58:07| And I'm perfectly, I'm really perfectly willing to do it because I think it's extremely important that there be no perception of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14287)|
| 3:58:14| conflict or someone's using their position on the ethics committee to promote their candidacy for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14294)|
| 3:58:22| And, you know, I mean, since you brought it up and I told her at the time, I said, I don't necessarily disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14302)|
| 3:58:28| And it really doesn't offend me and I really, you know, I mean, if it's the right thing to do, I want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14308)|
| 3:58:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| I'd like to agree with Commissioner Leuthold in that, you know, I think you've shown, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14321)|
| 3:58:49| to be a very rational and reasonable member of the ethics committee by all accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14329)|
| 3:58:54| And I guess my, you know, question is how far does this go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14334)|
| 3:59:00| And I don't want to throw stones anyway, but, you know, you got Cosby and Elaine Davis has actually turned in a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14340)|
| 3:59:08| So that's kind of a strange, oh, I picked up a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| So that's kind of a strange threshold to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14352)|
| 3:59:17| You know, I guess at what point do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14357)|
| 3:59:20| You know, I guess if you actually turn it in, so far I'm the only, there's three of us on there that may be running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14360)|
| 3:59:26| Like I said, I don't want to speak for Louis, Louis Cosby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14366)|
| 3:59:30| but he's indicated that if he turns, when and if he turns his petition in, I think he's going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14370)|
| 3:59:36| He said he would resign at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| But I would almost feel, I mean, you know, quite frankly, I think if he's going to do it, I should do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14379)|
| 3:59:44| particularly now that Elaine has brought it up as being an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14384)|
| 3:59:50| And, you know, something, I don't disagree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| I'm not sure that someone running for office should be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14392)|
| 3:59:57| Yeah, but that's kind of a difficult stance to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14397)|
| 4:00:03| Now, tell me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14403)|
| 4:00:05| We should, we are compelled to have a member on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14405)|
| 4:00:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14409)|
| 4:00:10| I mean, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14410)|
| 4:00:11| That's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14411)|
| 4:00:12| And let's just say there's a slew of us around this table that's running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14412)|
| 4:00:18| or have picked up a petition and will probably turn in a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14418)|
| 4:00:23| I mean, really what I would suggest if we do this is to choose someone whose term limited out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14423)|
| 4:00:29| Yeah, but then you're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14429)|
| 4:00:32| I guess at what point do you run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14432)|
| 4:00:34| I mean, your name is out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14434)|
| 4:00:37| If someone gets elected in August, you know, at what point do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14437)|
| 4:00:45| Is it the picking up of the petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| Is it the opening up of the date by the election commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| Or if that candidate's elected and then sitting on the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14453)|
| 4:01:00| and they make the statement I intend to run for re-election five years from now or three years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14460)|
| 4:01:06| do they immediately need to resign from the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14466)|
| 4:01:08| You know, I don't think once they're all, I mean, I don't think they're all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14468)|
| 4:01:10| But when you've turned your petition in, that's a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14470)|
| 4:01:13| You know, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=14473)|
