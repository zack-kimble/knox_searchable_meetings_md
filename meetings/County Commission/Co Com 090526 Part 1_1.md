| 2:34:15| a limit of $10,000 for the movement of prisoners back and forth across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| staff development and training and things of that nature is actually not that substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:25| It's a variation on the purchasing card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| and it's intended to separate travel-related expenses from other general government expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| like office supplies and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| so that as we monitor the budget and we cost allocate to specific accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| we're simply able to divide those expenses more seamlessly and expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| But P cards are issued generally to individual employees, except for contract bid cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9286)|
| 2:34:52| like for jail food and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| Travel cards will not be issued to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| They'll be issued to departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| It does, because I was thinking it was per individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| If it's a department, that's a whole different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| Now, what happens if they get to the 10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| Do they have to come back and ask for another 10,000, or what's the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| Ordinarily, if somebody is, say they have a month where there's a great deal of travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| or they're going to meet their limit, they contact the purchasing director, Mr. Holt, he can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:22| or Mr. Myers, Matt Myers, and they can temporarily for that month only lift that limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| in whatever increment is necessary in order to get the department the volume of travel that they would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| and then the following month the limit returns back to where it's ordinarily set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| So that's a monthly thing, is the 10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| John, one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Sir, we need to know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| Dwight Mendevate, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| And where you live or where you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Main Avenue, Suite 615.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| John Troyer, how much money would you say we spend on car washes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| I know that you said we had a contract up or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| but approximately how much money would be going for car washes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:08| Yeah, I don't have that number available right now, so I couldn't give you a good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9368)|
| 2:36:13| I'd be glad to provide it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| Yes, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Mayor, I'd like you to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:28| Now, I mean, I understand at this time we don't have anything carved in stone as far as a film commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| but I have your word that the film commission is going to exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| or that the mission of the film commission is going to be filled in some form or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| either through the chamber or through tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| Ms. Ray, I think, is here today or was earlier, and I know Mr. Edwards is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| Yes, that's an important part of what we're going to do in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| It may not have the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| It may not have the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| But we're doing more with less in every area, but we're certainly going to focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| It's been a big part of what we've accomplished in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| It's a reason that we have lots of citizens employed in these industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| We're going to continue to focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Now, and the film commission, as it exists, it becomes defunded, I guess, what, July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| Will you have something together by July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| I'll try my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| If you don't, do I have your commitment that you'll be acting film commissioner until you get something worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:30| I think after a couple of days on the job, you may not want me as acting film commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| Well, if you are, I hope you're the shortest serving film commissioner ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| Commissioner, we're going to work very hard to continue to grow this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| I realize how important it is to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| We've made some tremendous headway in this area, and we're not going to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| And I also want to follow up with what Mr. Hammond was talking about earlier as far as what we're spending on car washes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9470)|
| 2:37:59| I guess this is more a question for Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| I'm wondering if it would be possible that we could use prisoners, trustees, to do some sort of detail operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:11| We're already beginning to look at that, and the sheriff's office has been very cooperative, and that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:17| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| I've enjoyed the debate and, or not debate, dialogue, I guess, for the last couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9501)|
| 2:38:28| I made so many notes here of the things I wanted to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| I have a hard time commenting them all, but I'll be brief and come back if I remember something in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| Just a general comment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| I feel very good about where we are economically, and when you look at where other people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| other jurisdictions are around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| Frankly, last fall and winter, I was thinking nothing but dire consequences, just looking at the economy in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:55| about where we would be, either a massive or substantial tax increase, which is not realistic in this environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| or substantial cuts to the budget, and we've come through that without either, apparently we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:10| I think the economy has been more than generous to us, and it's more generous than I expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:18| and more than maybe we deserve compared to our other sister counties around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| I enjoyed and learned an immense amount of information from the workshop a couple of weeks back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| It's my first one with the county here, as it is with a number of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:36| And I am in sympathy a lot with what Mr. Pinkston and Mr. Lambert say about extending this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:43| and going through another day or two of dialogue and workshops and dissecting of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:52| I frankly don't have many more questions to ask, and I'm thinking about what the, other than the recent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9592)|
| 2:40:00| this second wave or last barrage of emails about the film commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| the vast majority of my constituents in the fourth district and mine and Commissioner Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:12| were about the so-called cultural situation, the museum, the symphony, the dogwood, those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9612)|
| 2:40:21| And with the help of Gloria Ray and the tourism, using that mechanism to fund these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9621)|
| 2:40:29| most of the requests from the people I know that email me and the ones I don't know also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:36| and the phone calls and the people you see on the street or at the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| they have been resolved to more or less the people's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| I'm leaning towards voting for the budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| I think about two definitive conversations I've had in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| One on the phone with Dr. McIntyre, I guess it was Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| We had a very good conversation, and I asked him, I point blank, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| Does it mean a lot to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| And he wouldn't let me pin it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| He's an excellent educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| I think he used the word, no, it would not be an emergency if we didn't get it by the end of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| but it would certainly be to our advantage if we had a budget to work off of by the end of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| primarily to recruit people, quality people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| I'm sure he's going to recruit quality people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| but possibly the best quality people for some replacements that he may need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| And so that's two-thirds of the budget, and putting the budget up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| and it says of 80%, I talked to the sheriff at length yesterday, twice actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| at the Veterans Cemetery ceremony and also at Fount City yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| and he seemed pleased with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| He said, I have no real problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| I'm happy to, you know, love to have more money, just like Mr. McIntyre would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| but I'm happy with it, and I hope it, you know, basically moves through intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9728)|
| 2:42:15| And so those two, again, that being in excess of about 80% of the budget we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:21| I'm leaning towards voting for it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| I don't, I have no problem having the whole day of June 2nd or 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| whatever it is, blocked out for a workshop, and if that's the commission's will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| I'll certainly be here and ask questions and learn a lot from the discussion that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| But I'm leaning towards voting for it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| I don't think we can fine-tune it, work on it many more days or many more hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9762)|
| 2:42:49| I don't know that we're going to come up with anything that's really going to be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9769)|
| 2:42:55| That's sort of where I'm at on it right now as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| And let me ask Mr. Troyer a couple of quick things while he is sitting on virtually the front row there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:08| You and I have talked about this in the hallways and here and there, about the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:15| Back last fall when we were flush with our property tax receipts, we bought, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9795)|
| 2:43:25| we bought as an investment roughly $50 million of our own bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:30| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Took those out of the market because we thought it was a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| Have we put those back to the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| They are in the process of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| The deal is not closed yet, but it should be closed very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| So those will go back into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| They're variable rate bonds or are they fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| Variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| And you and I talked, I think, at the retirement investment meeting and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| or Commissioner Anders alluded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| We're about to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| We're about to sell $50 million in bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| Oh, fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| Fifteen in bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| Well, we have $50 that we need to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| Am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| The $50 is going to be part of the refinancing and that's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| Why take them to bands now and not long-term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:26| Our approach has just been to use the bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| One of the things that I like about the bands and use that as a tool is that we have very strict requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9870)|
| 2:44:38| from the Internal Revenue Service on your spend-down requirements when you issue the tax-exempt bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| And what we do is we use this as a tool to make sure that we can meet those spend-down requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| as we spend into the bond anticipation note and then we issue the long-term bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| and reimburse ourselves with that knowing that we've already met those spend-down requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| and that way we've fulfilled the arbitrage requirements on the spend-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| Arbitrage criteria primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| You'll, of course, have to bring that to us, won't you, when you have a bond resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:17| Yeah, well, that's later here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| That's later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| And finally, do you know yet if you'll use any of the so-called Build America Bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:34| Yeah, the stimulus stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| The bond resolutions put in the authority to use the Build America Bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| We're still researching the details of that to see if they make the best sense for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| So that option is available, written into the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| but we still don't know if we're going to pursue that path or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| And those would be taxable bonds, wouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Yeah, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| Well, keep us surprised of that because I'd like to know what other ways we can benefit from the stimulus package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| whenever that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| I agree with Mr. Shouse and a lot of my colleagues about the things that they've said about the budget in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:21| Certainly, I've done some homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| I've done quite a bit of homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| It hadn't been graded yet, so I'm not sure about the effectiveness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9988)|
| 2:46:35| I certainly do appreciate John Troyer and his staff and Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| They've been very helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| And, of course, I've had a lot of questions, and I get questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| and it seems like I get questions from some very astute people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10009)|
| 2:46:55| And John and his staff have never failed to answer them and answered them in a reasonable way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| as well as questions about the school system, and Dr. McIntyre has addressed some of those for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| So, I mean, all in all, I feel comfortable with going ahead with the budget, voting on the budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:17| I probably, too, would like to ask a couple of questions, John, just one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:27| Oh, and before I do that, by the way, you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| the commission received something from the school system that I requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| and that was a little more than I requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| It was all I wanted was the central office staff salary schedules, and that's on pages 34 through 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:45| If you're interested, that's page 34 through 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| You've got 141 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| The school system is all about keeping us well informed, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| So, John, I guess my basic question is still I worry about debt, I guess, more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10075)|
| 2:48:08| That's from being a teacher, you know, and having the revenue side being real restricted, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| But do you sleep well at night when you think about debt, when you think about Knox County's debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10092)|
| 2:48:20| Do you ever wake up thinking about debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| I wake up thinking about the budget, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| But I feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| I do want to point you back to the information that was provided over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| just kind of giving you a little bit of historical context of our outstanding debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| and compare that with our annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| And I think these numbers are favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| And also, looking ahead, I think it's important to look at years 2010 through 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:50| Those numbers are projected to decline in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:54| And so I feel very comfortable with what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10134)|
| 2:49:01| I feel very comfortable with our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| And I think this is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| Part of it is, part of the reason to use debt is that you want to match the people who are going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| from these projects with the people who pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| And so that helps that, you know, if you were to try to do everything and pay for it in cash today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:22| then we would do many fewer projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| And we've got a lot of portables out there on the school system, school system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| And what that would mean is that we wouldn't be able to address a lot of school needs without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| And I think it just makes a good tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| Just this past April, just last month, our bond raters have looked at it again another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| and confirmed a double A plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| And, you know, this is the highest bond rating ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| So, I mean, we can look at statistics and ratios about debt, like per capita, assessed value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10189)|
| 2:50:00| debt ratio, assessed value, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| But pretty much everything is summarized really in a bond rating, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:08| Doesn't it kind of trump all the statistics and ratios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| It summarizes them, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| Do any of those statistics or ratios jump out at you as a warning sign, say, per capita, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10214)|
| 2:50:23| Because when I look at that, there was some kind of benchmark about $1,200 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10223)|
| 2:50:28| And ours tends to be higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| And so are there statistics like that that bother you or you tend to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| And I think you have managed our budget in one of the most difficult years probably in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10236)|
| 2:50:44| And we've gotten through this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| I don't see next year being any worse than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| And so I think you're to be commended in your predictions, your ability to predict revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:58| anticipate what we have coming in and our ability to manage this budget based on those revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10258)|
| 2:51:08| I think it's been pretty much right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| So I have confidence in you that you'll be able to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| But I still want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| I still want to solicit from you any points that you're concerned about as you look at statistical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10275)|
| 2:51:25| From the debt, I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| I feel like this is a responsible capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| We're meeting some needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| There are still needs that we're not meeting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| And I feel like as far as our balance sheet goes, you look at just in the next five years we would drop our number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| You say, okay, our debt, our outstanding debt, our mortgage amount is less than our annual salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| And so it's that way right now at 94%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| And over the next five years that number would drop to 82% or 83%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10317)|
| 2:51:58| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| John, I know you've been asked about these car washes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| I mean, are we talking a few thousand dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| Are we talking tens of thousands of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| I would rather have an exact number and do that rather than just expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10335)|
| 2:52:20| Let me just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| Just know that it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| Well, then I'll just cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| And I'm going to amend my original motion as long as the second agrees to cut out all contract services that deal with car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:37| And is that something you could handle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| I mean, you'd be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| We can cancel the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| Sam, you were my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| Do you agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| I don't know that we need to be washing cars for take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| Well, you know, I think there are bigger issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| This is not a small one, but I think this is one of many issues with take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| I guess I would like something more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| I mean, I think we have issues with our take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| And we've asked for some guidance and some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| And to my knowledge, that hasn't really been given anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| But this is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| But I would hate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10398)|
| 2:53:19| I don't want to end it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:20| I'm just amending my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| And if you'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10405)|
| 2:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| I just want to report that it's just been told to me that our number, our spending has been $13,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| Commissioner Lucco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| Instead of amending it on the budget, can we amend it on our drive-home policy whenever it's presented and voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| Because you're talking about care and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| It doesn't make any difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10427)|
| 2:53:48| I just don't think we need to be paying for car washes, however we want to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| That's what I'm struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10436)|
| 2:53:57| I'll just forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10437)|
| 2:53:58| Just forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| We'll deal with that when we talk about our take-home policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:09| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| I'm along the same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10451)|
| 2:54:12| When are we going to talk about take-home, that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| Craig, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| When is the report coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| I believe it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| It's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| It's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Because I got the same thing what you were talking about, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| about these people that are getting the take-home vehicles and they don't even pay the part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| Paul brought up a good point, too, and he was talking about the national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10473)|
| 2:54:38| I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Jolie, what is it that you send in for us as commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| We join this national thing that you pay our dues once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| How much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| I don't have my budget in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| Do you have a ballpark figure of how much it is per commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| You know, with term limits coming, I don't know that any of us, you know, go to that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10494)|
| 2:54:57| I'd be in favor of taking that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| I don't use that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| You know, we're cutting everybody else's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| I think we need to be responsible for our end, too, and do what we can to cut county commission's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| Let me say, Commissioner Smith, I cut the county commission budget one-third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10507)|
| 2:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| Are those dues still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| I'm saying if you didn't cut those dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| Well, I don't know if I cut dues, but I cut the budget a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| I don't see that we don't know if anybody is even going to those meetings anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10520)|
| 2:55:30| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| I just wanted to say, being the newest member to this county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| is that I've tried to do my homework the best I can, and I've talked to John Troia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:44| I've talked to our sheriff, J.J. Jones, with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10544)|
| 2:55:50| and it seems to me that everybody is trying to work together to pull the budget in this very trying time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:59| Also, I listen to the people in my district as well as Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| and my biggest things have been take-home vehicles, the film commission, the opera, symphony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| Dogwood Arts from their cuts, and I feel like that with Gloria Ray and the tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| that everybody is coming together to try to help everybody in this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| and I feel like I'm ready to vote on the budget also today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| and I just appreciate all the hard work that everybody has put together from all areas of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:32| and I just wanted to make that statement that I feel like we've all tried to do our homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:38| and meet as much as we can, and if anybody else has got any other suggestions, now is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10598)|
| 2:56:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| We've talked about the largest part of the budget, which is education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:57| and it's basically a maintenance of effort deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| I don't know that we've really spoken to law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| so I don't think anyone is really looking to remove anything from law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| We've addressed things that come down then into the $100,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| and we've talked about the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| and I think he's getting his concerns addressed by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| We've talked about two or three different $10,000 things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| We've talked about some parking, and now we're down to talking about dollar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:27| If I can get Commissioner Briggs to turn his light off, maybe we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:34| That's a lot of pressure on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| That's about like asking me to keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| Commissioner Briggs, what are you going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| Well, I am going to say something because the reason is that I actually agree with everything that Commissioner Wright just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| But what I do want to put out, and this may or may not be the time to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| doesn't deal with tens of thousands or millions, but tens of millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| And this is the 800-pound gorilla that no one wants to look in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:10| And it really has to do with the defined benefit plans that the county has out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| This year, I think we contributed, or it's in the budget to contribute about $5 million to keep it fiduciarily sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| But the truth of the matter is that the two closed and the one open plan, we're $50 million in the hole on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10705)|
| 2:58:34| And at some point, we're going to have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| It's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| And, like I said, this is the 800-pound gorilla that no one wants to talk about and that no one wants to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:48| But we can go ahead and pass a budget without talking about this because we do have time, I think, to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:54| It is going to be a complex matter, but that is something that we're going to have to look at at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| because it is going to have a major impact on budgets in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:09| Richard, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| I have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10751)|
| 2:59:12| The defined benefits plan, we can't, as a commission, take any action on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10752)|
| 2:59:20| The only thing we can do is put it before the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| and let the voters make that decision whether or not to close it or keep it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10762)|
| 2:59:28| There may be a way to sit down with the people that are involved with the one plan that's open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10768)|
| 2:59:35| and see if we can work out something because it is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| I mean, I think that we need to do something for the uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| That's the uniformed officers pension plan is the proper name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| But it's going to be something that if we don't address, it's going to be one of those things that could really get us into trouble, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10788)|
| 2:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| I mean, there's different ways to look at it, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| If we change it substantially because it was passed as a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| and it would have to go back before the voters as a referendum issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| But there may be other ways, like I said, but this is something that we may want to put this off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| because it's not going to be fun to talk about or pretty to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| It's going to be very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| But it is going to be a budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:22| And I'm in favor of voting as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| I need a recess, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| Mr. Chairman, Nick McBride, Chief Deputy, Knox County Register, Deeds Office, 400 Main Avenue, Suite 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10830)|
| 3:00:37| Commissioner Hammond, earlier you asked about the fee office holders and what increases we were going to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10837)|
| 3:00:44| That was an item on page 12 of 13 that you all will discuss asking from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10844)|
| 3:00:51| But let me tell you that historically, the mayor will tell you and so will the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10851)|
| 3:00:57| what the register has given to her employees and the previous register to his employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| the increases have been whatever commission has improved for county general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| And incentives are the exact same thing that county commission has improved for county general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10867)|
| 3:01:14| Our records are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| I don't know how more transparent, as a fee office, the register of deeds can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| Every month, you get a report of every one of our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| Once a year, we file a letter of agreement with the mayor, finance director sees, the law director sees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| and it's in Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10889)|
| 3:01:30| It's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| We are transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| I know that you've been to our office and you spoke with the register on some questions that you've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| But let me let you know that all of our records are open and we're not trying to hide anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| We have not received a letter from you asking for this information, but there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10910)|
| 3:01:55| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10915)|
| 3:02:05| Chuck, were you wanting to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10925)|
| 3:02:10| I have a note up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| I was just told to be here in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10936)|
| 3:02:17| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| 1137 West Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10945)|
| 3:02:26| West Scott Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=10948)|
