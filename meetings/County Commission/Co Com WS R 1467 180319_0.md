| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| My name is Eve Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| My address is 3703 River Trace Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| I come to you this evening as the past chair of the community health council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| My year was up, but I'm still actively involved and wanted to thank you for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| and your interest in the community health council, and we do an annual update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| and that's what I'm doing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| It will take me just a few minutes, be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| You have hopefully before you a plan, our CHIP plan, our community health improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| It's a roadmap for improving four priority health issues in Knox County that deal with mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| This effort in particular, this plan spans from 2016 to 2019, so it's been ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| and we have four organizations working in each of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| So as far as what I'm going to update with you tonight, over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| our partners in those four areas have improved data collection and communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| They've supported prevention efforts and worked for policy changes, among other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| And the improvements we've seen trending as a result of these efforts decreases in the adult suicide rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| the amount of opioids prescribed, the number of babies born dependent on drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| and the smoking rates among youth and pregnant women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| This does not include vaping, which we don't have a lot of data on yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| but as far as for the traditional smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| We still have a lot of work to do in some areas, such as opioid overdoses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| suicide attempts among youth, and pedestrian and bicycle crashes with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| All the details as far as our work are in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| If you have any questions, please go to HealthyNOCS.org, or you can contact us at NOCSCHC at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| And we don't have any specific asks for you at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| I just wanted to make you aware of where we are and just give you a brief annual update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| and look forward to any opportunities to work together that may come out of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| So that's it in a very quick nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| I wanted to make it quite brief, but if you all have any questions, I'll be glad to try and answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=658)|

| 0:11:21| in Knox County to require sidewalks and new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=685)|

| 0:15:35| Mr. Snowden, I pulled this off of consent to basically get an update on what this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| and we all know this is an intersection that causes a lot of people a headache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| and it's nice to see that we're getting this kind of work done with no local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Exactly what all will take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| There's quite a few improvements there that are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| One is which is currently underway now, which was kind of our partnership with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| which is the relocation of Schaefer Road over to Iron Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| That will eliminate that at-grade intersection on the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Once that intersection goes away, TDOT as part of this project will widen that ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Right now you have two lefts and one right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| When it's complete, there will be two lefts and two rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| In addition to that, they will be modifying the slope paving under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| under the parkway itself to allow for a dual left turn going westbound onto southbound Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| and in doing so, extending the ramp for acceleration going southbound towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| They will also be lengthening the deceleration for northbound folks getting off of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| Right now some traffic backs up and people sit in the shoulder and through lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| so they will be actually extending that deceleration lane all the way to that first cutover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| where Schaefer Road currently comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| The last thing they'll be doing is actually creating a right turn ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| from westbound Hardin Valley onto northbound Pellissippi towards Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| That will allow us to eliminate the left turn westbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Right now if you're going westbound on Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| if you want to go northbound on Pellissippi, you have to make a left turn and take the loop ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| By adding this right turn ramp, that will eliminate that left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and allow us to add that time that's in that cycle phase of that signal into other phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| so that ramp will actually add a lot of capacity to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Like you said, all this is done with no cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Our partnership was the relocation of Schaefer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| When is the timeframe on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| They anticipate a letting in February of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| so you'll see some construction starting in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| with probably a year-to-18-month timeframe for completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| It will be a headache during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| but with that many more access points and turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| it should help quite a bit with flow at that congested bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Correct. It will increase a lot of capacity through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| by adding—we'll be able to retime the signals and just allow a lot better—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| those right turn movements are just a lot better than a left turn movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Just one question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| That southbound entrance ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| do you have how much it's been extended than it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| I can get you the specific measurements on that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| It is several hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It's a considerable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Yes. Right now, you kind of have to come up in more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| It's almost a yield condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| It looks like—I'll get you the exact measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| but it is several hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| On page 9, item number 55, Resolution 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| is approving a five-year lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| between Knox County, Tennessee, and Clifford, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| for the premises located at 1645 Downtown West Boulevard, Unit 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| and Downtown West Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| to be used for early voting, training classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| storage and election equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| and general office use by the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| It's my understanding that this contract has not been finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| so I make a motion that we pass with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Finalized by next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| He believes so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Come on up, Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Cliff Rogers, 3526 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Administrator of Elections for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I figure no matter when you all consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| whether it's next week or at the end of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| and we're really working hard to try to get it before you all by next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| a commercial lease is not like anything I've ever encountered before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and with the able assistance of the Knox County Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| in particular Charles Sturkey, we're working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| And if I may, and if you permit me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| I'd like just to give you a little background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| about why we are where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| But in a nutshell, the free ride at Downtown West is coming to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| And for the record, it is not because the landlord there is telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| they will not work with us to provide free space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| In fact, they're doing so again for our May primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Rather, it is simply because they've leased about everything they have out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and the real estate market is hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| It's very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| And remember, the landlord is there to make money for the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| They're not there to hold some spot for the Election Commission to use for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| whenever an election rolls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Keep in mind, too, that we have been using some spot for free out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| for well over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| They have saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| while we've been using that spot for free out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| But the voters who live and work out there have come to expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| that we will always have a presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| And I can't imagine having successful early voting in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| without a location in Downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| And as most of you all know, it is always the busiest early voting location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| For example, we voted, and we will continue to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| about 30,000 people in a presidential election out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And I also can't imagine the disappointment of the voters if we are no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| We will all hear about it very loudly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| And we've been real lucky that the landlord there has always had something for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| And in some years, we've been bounced around a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| In 2012, we got bounced around three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| And I can tell you folks get upset when you move them just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| They call me up and tell me we got disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| And they're very unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| But I try to explain to them the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| And basically, we're getting it for free, and beggars can't be choosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Anyway, I knew last year that this arrangement was going to come to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| The standalone building we had used for early voting out there from 2012-2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| was leased by Frank's Barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| And we had two other potential voting sites for our city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And both of them got leased right before we got ready to vote for early voting locations last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| Fortunately, there was a third location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| And if any of you all voted there in the city elections, you will know it is very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| It works for the city elections, and it will work for the May primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| But that space, again, is too small for August and most certainly for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And I don't know when that spot's going to get leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| And then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| So I reached out to the landlord a few weeks ago to see what space we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| and pay for it like any other tenant out there that would have sufficient accommodations for a large election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| And what we're looking at is half of the canned pie of Tokyo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| the old spot that used to be out there for those of you that are familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| It's real close to where we're voting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| They're going to divide it into two spots, and one of which is going to be Unit 40, which is going to be ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| It's got square footage of 33-42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| And you need to know that including operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| what we're talking about for monthly rent would be slightly south of $5,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| The space is plenty big, enough for a large turnout election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and we could conduct some, if not all, of our training classes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| rather than in the basement of the old Sears warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| where we sometimes have serious parking issues, or even in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| We could also store some of our equipment there and have security cameras installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| I also anticipate using it as a satellite office as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| We could accept qualifying petitions, campaign financial disclosures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| I will also tell you that while we are presently working on the details, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| we may or may not have it worked out by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| So let me just stop there to be sure that you all understand the lay of the land out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| and how serious I am about we have got to have a presence in downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| I've just about done all I can to use free spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| and we have the same problem, as Commissioner Daley knows, out in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| We've been very blessed for our early voting spot to use a church out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| But this is kind of a let's see how we're going to do arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| because the church can kick us out where we wouldn't have a spot there in August or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| I just hope that we have a very pleasant experience for the church members out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| But it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| We don't have enough county facilities, stuff that we pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| You've got New Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| You've got the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you all for the Nicarne Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| It's a wonderful place to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| But I don't have ten locations, and that's how many we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| You know, we have more early voting locations, say, than Chattanooga, the comparable city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| everybody's always bragging about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| They've got four locations and nowhere close to the number of hours that we're going to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| So we really try to work hard to have these early voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| But I'm down here with my hat in my hand saying I've got to have some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| and we're going to have to have it soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| or we're going to have a serious problem out in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| So, anyway, I'm going to stop here and let you all fire away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I guess I get to fire away. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| We do have that problem in South Knoxville that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| and we do feel disenfranchised because we're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| I've been looking and I want to find a building that we as Knox County can own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| where we can have a place to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| We can have a maybe I would love to see a south precinct for the Sheriff's Department out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| There's things that we can do out there that we need to look at as far as the citizens in the south area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| But I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| But, you know, will this $5,000 a month be broken between the city, county, state, federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| or will it all be county tax dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| And, in short, the county is going to have to pay for most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Now, when we have a city election out there and are using it for early voting, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| for that month, and there will be usually at least two months in a city election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| we will bill the city for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| During a March presidential preference primary, we will bill the state for that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| And if we were to have any special elections, the state would also be required legally to pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| But I'm not going to act like, oh, yeah, most of it's going to get passed along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| No, it's Knox County, and that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| And trust me, if I can find a way to send it, I've got Chris Caldwell on me all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| looking for me to send bills to somebody else other than Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| So we're always looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| We're always mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| And I know that you run your department very well, and I'm proud of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| You know, every time I dealt with your department, it's always above board and excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Real quickly, if you would, give me an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| What do you expect on early turnout voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Give us, if you've got the locations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| I know Meridian Baptist Church is going to be in the south Knoxville this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| So just a quick update, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Yeah, I'm expecting, just by way of background, four years ago for the May primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| we didn't even have 30,000 people vote, which I think is pathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| We've got over 200,000 voters that could have voted in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| This one, I think we've got a lot of interest because of the sheriff's race and the mayor's race, among others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| but those are the ones we know draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| I am hoping for 50,000 to 60,000 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| I'm hoping for more than that, but this is what we're planning for is about 50,000 to 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| Commissioner, you highlighted one of the changes, and that's out at the Meridian Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| But we're going to be in the same locations that we were in for the presidential election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| and we're going to be in the small assembly room because our space got eaten up down there at the end of the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| So we're going to be here for this one, which is more convenient, Love Kitchen, New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| We've got a spot on Clinton Highway that we're getting for free from Hallrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| I want to thank them for working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Farragut Town Hall will be there, the Carter Library, Halls Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| and, of course, the Carnes Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So those are the places, those are the ten locations that we will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and I'm going to caution everybody listening to me, the hours are going to vary at Meridian Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| because of church activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| We're going to close the Carnes Senior Center down at 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| and we're going to be closed on weekends because of all the ball games over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| It's the same arrangement we had for the presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| And, of course, the city county building has always got a few squirrely hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| because the state legislature has got involved in how we need to do the courthouse location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| and so we have to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Does that answer your question? Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Yes, sir. My question is not for Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| I guess it's for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Moving forward, Caldwell, if you could come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I support the measure, but approving this contract in this fiscal year could create an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| I guess I know it's only $5,000 or $10,000, but Chris, if we approve this contract hopefully next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| We wouldn't enter into it. I don't think it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Yeah, it's going to be in there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| I don't think it goes into effect until FY19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| We could have maybe a month. It's going to depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Not a big deal, but I'm talking about moving forward into the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Is this something we're going to see in the budget, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Yeah, he put it in his budget request, and we sit down with him to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| and I would imagine that he's probably got $5,000 in his budget in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| We try to budget properly so that we don't have to have a shortfall, but it is impossible to budget elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| We're not like any other entity in government, I've come to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| So we do the best we can do, but, again, we're sometimes just going to have to dig in our pocket a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| and do the right thing, at least in my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I agree with your perspective on it. I'm just making sure that we're all on board together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Oh, don't worry. I went to check with him before I did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Don't waste your all's time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Cliff rarely gets in front of us, but I'm glad he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| I've known Cliff for 46 years, and I just have to say, your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| everywhere I go, people are just talking how well it's run, and we appreciate that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| So now that I've gotten you all excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I'm not excited. I've been around you too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Here's the other shoe that's going to drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Paint me a picture on how that is going to be used in your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| although I think it's still in the planning stages, but the months that it's not being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| would it be storage space as well for like voting machines or meeting places or training facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| or this, when you talked about an office maybe to accept applications to run or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1931)|
| 0:32:20| would that be one day a week, a couple days a month, or what's kind of in your vision for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Well, right now, it'd be something we'd ease into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| I'm not going to say that we're going to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| and I've also left it somewhat vague with the landlord so that when we're not using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| if somebody else wants to use it and we don't have live election equipment down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| we would be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I see the day, to answer you a little more pointedly, we're not going to be in this courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| There's going to come a time, and I've already told, you know, I want what Chattanooga has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| I always want what Chattanooga has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| But they've got an election commission office away from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| They store all their equipment instead of like where we've got it at the Sears Warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| which I keep hearing they're going to try to sell it out from under us, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| I want all the equipment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I want it as an early voting site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I want my staff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I want to have breathing room out there, free parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| That'd be nice, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I think my staff would enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| But I see the time when we're no longer down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| I see what's going on out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| and it just seems to be a movement away from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| I may not be around for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I don't know what I'm going to be around for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| But that's what I see, something on down the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I want to ask the question, if we're paying for this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| will other facilities that we're using to vote at then be interested in having the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| then the county, if we're at the Love Kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| will the Love Kitchen come to the county and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| now we would like to be paid for the use of that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| That, too, is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| And I can just tell you about our relationship with the Love Kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| is that they love to have us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| They really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| And the same thing for, I've got to worry about North Knoxville and South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| but a lot of that's controlled by what's going on in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| And I must tell you, I can't brag on a lot of the commercial developers enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| When they've got space sitting there empty and I reach out to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| and I've got a lot of contacts in the commercial real estate world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| thankfully they'll return my phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| But they've really given us free space as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| But once it gets leased out, we're out of luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And that's why what I heard Commissioner Daley tell me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| buying a building in South Knoxville, that's music to my ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I would love to have not to be worried about South Knoxville every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| It is the bane of my existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I have more problem out there than anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Followed closely by North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| But the Love Kitchen seems to be a place that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I'm always going to be for being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I've heard more rumors about that we're pulling out of the Love Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| It ain't going to happen on my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| or at least it will be somebody else doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| The commission can take my recommendations or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I don't see that happening, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And will we incur the rehab costs to the facility in that west center, downtown west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| Are we absorbing the costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| They're going to get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| We've got detailed drawings about putting in nice bathrooms for men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| instead of all of my employees sharing the same bathroom down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| So we're doing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| We're saying this is what we've got to have to this building to make it functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| They get off the hook a little bit with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| because I don't care whether we have carpet out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| We're not out there that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I don't care what it looks like inside, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| But we've got to have it functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| We've got to have a lot of electrical outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| But they're going to be doing that before we get in it as part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| so we don't have to eat those costs on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Cliff, downtown west isn't a third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Perhaps we can solve all these problems if you'll join me in my efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| to get the administration to build a rec center or a senior center there in downtown west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| I would love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| But I'll tell you that we have, when I first got this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| we looked at voting in senior centers, the ones that were already there, or in youth centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| And the problem is we have to run everybody out of there for about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| And we make a lot of seniors, a lot of young folks mad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| and a lot of those people vote and they're going to take it out on somebody else, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| Nobody would ever get elected to the job I have more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| So it's something we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| But when you all did Carr and Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| you set up a room where we could use it for early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| and that's what saved us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| And that's what we need in every public facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Nobody thinks about these elections until it's election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Everybody else just wants us to go away when we're not in an election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| And it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| How many square feet did you say the facility there will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Thirty-three, forty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| And that's bigger than what we had at Frank's Barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And we squeezed machines in every square inch of that place for a presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| And that's why we need just a little bit more space to get those machines in out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| because that's where we vote a lot of people at downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I just admire you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| We had you on the air for years talking about elections and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| and you do such a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| And I want you to talk straight with us from now on, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Don't sugarcoat anything anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| Commissioner, that's very sage advice, and I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| And that's the very reason I'll never run for elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| I'll never get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I ain't going to dance around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| That's just not my style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Do me a favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Take three big, deep breaths before you leave so that blood pressure will go down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| You know, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Part of it's just I get fired up about this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I mean, I wish everybody else would get fired up about elections out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| We have a motion to approve with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2312)|

| 0:38:35| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2315)|

| 0:39:03| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2343)|

| 0:39:06| Mr. Hammond, you've got a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| I was telling him, I say, you've got him warmed up for me there, Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Commissioners, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| A little bit of background on why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Two years ago, we did not have a mechanism for those who went through the court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| to work to pay off their court costs and litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| And so we worked with our judges and we worked with our state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| We had to go to Nashville to get this approved through the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Richard Major did a lot of heavy lifting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| And so we went to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| They passed and gave us a pilot program for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I will tell you that we've had some success with it, not the success that we would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| but we have had some success with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And so because it was a pilot project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| we needed to go back before the legislature this year to get it extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| And so when we did, there were other lawmakers there who liked the idea of having this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| because we were the only people in the state that had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| They wanted it for their counties as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| and so they passed it unanimously in the House and the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And this is now a statewide program that counties can opt into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| And so the caveat was that they wanted the clerks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| and the people that would be in charge of the program to come to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| and ask for their approval to extend the program or to begin the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| So I'm here today to ask you to give us the opportunity to extend the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| I will tell you that we have had 40 individuals who have come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| who have been a part of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| We're approaching 1,000 hours of community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Most of this community service has been litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| We've also worked with CARM, where individuals who are not physically able to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and pick up trash can go to CARM, and they work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| We will be looking for some other partners, some nonprofit partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| to partner with us on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Basically, this is a clerk's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| The judges give the approval when they come out of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| It's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| No one is forcing any individual to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| but if they want to come in and work off their costs, they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| And so they fill out an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Once they fill out that application, we review it to make sure that if they can pay, they can pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| If we feel like that they can't pay but they want to work off their costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| then they are eligible to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Now, they cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| We will not accept folks who have serious crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| So if it's domestic abuse, if it's domestic assault or assault, those types of crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| they're not eligible for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| I review each one of them, and I personally approve or disapprove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| and we have disapproved some because of the nature of the crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| that they have been convicted of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| So as I said, we have had not the success we would like, but we have had some success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| The judges are beginning to take a look at it favorably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| and so we feel like that we're going to have more success moving down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Now, this program is for court costs only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| and this is an opportunity for people to come in and repay their debt to society by doing some work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and we hope, as I said, to expand it so that we can get some other nonprofit agencies involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| So that's why I'm here today is to ask you to give us the approval to continue with the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| that we've already had established for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| I wanted you to come up and brag on yourself, pat yourself on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| for this pilot program that is in the state now, and it is an opt-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| A lot of times I think our state legislatures need to do more opt-ins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and we could get a whole lot more done for the counties that can afford to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| But one quick question, and every time I've came to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| you've shot straight with me, like Cliff, and your office runs great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you. I see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Is it $10 an hour that they work off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| What's the wage that you assign to someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| It's approximately $10 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| We're looking at upping that because some people will come out of court and they'll owe $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| Well, you know, that's going to take a long time to work that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| But what we do is if someone is really serious about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| if they show up to pick up trash when it's 10 degrees outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| or they probably don't do it when it's 10 degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| but if they show us that they show up on time, they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| they come in, they get their paperwork filled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| and they really show that they're really wanting to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| we'll talk with the judges about cutting them some slack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| so that they're not trying to do this for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| but they'll do it for several weeks or even months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| And so the people who have done it, I mean, they've been very diligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| and they have come, and we've even had one individual that got their driver's license reinstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| and so they were able to go out and find work just by getting their driver's license reinstated by working off the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I apologize for doing this, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| and allowing people to be able to have a part to give back to our community to help themselves also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| Is there, can any of the other fee offices with Knox County opt in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| or is it just you, just the criminal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| This is just the criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| So for the other offices that collect fees and have this same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| they would have to go through the whole what you did and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| Yeah, and probably go to the legislature or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| but yes, this program is just for the court, just for my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2687)|
| 0:44:58| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2698)|

| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| This item is added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2710)|

| 0:45:15| It's authorizing the acceptance of a donation in the amount of $200 from Natural Alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| in support of the at-risk youth program of the Knox County Public Defender's Community Law Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2727)|

| 0:45:30| Proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| And Resolution 906 was also added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| It's authorizing payment for the defense of deputies sued in Chansbury Court Action 194873-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2745)|
| 0:45:56| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| I guess, you know, we've got the resolution before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| And I know we, the Chairman has stated we don't need to be too far into this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| But, so we got the resolution and the Law Director's Office issued an opinion in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| And so, I guess, Mr. Rubel, if you want to kind of explain how we got to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| I'm not really sure I can, but I'll give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Well, I guess, you know, we've got, essentially, we're, the pension, the Law Director's Office is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| suing the pension board, I guess, in turn, has had to hire outside counsel and some of our former retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| former employees are named in the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And so, the Mayor and the Sheriff's Office is asking that we fund their representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| My name is Mike Rubel of 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| I am the Chief Counsel for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| As Commissioner Anders has pointed out, this litigation is between the Law Director and the retirement board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| There is an issue with regard to the definition of a word in the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| The definition of the word is salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| And there is a disagreement between the two as to what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Those of you, I see some nodding your heads, you're much more familiar with this than some of the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| And these officers have been caught up in the middle of this disagreement between the Law Director's Office and the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| There's seven of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| And we think it is fundamentally unfair for them to be asked at the kind of salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| at the kind of retirement amounts that they're getting, for them to be asked to pay for a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| Under our charter, when an officer gets involved, when any employee gets involved in an action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| that is because of his employment with Knox County, he is entitled to have his counsel paid for by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| And I understand the Law Director's position, and they've said that they don't think they're entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| My job is to come up here and to tell you that it is fundamentally unfair for these officers to get sued by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| not have representation for them to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| We're not talking, I've seen the Law Director's memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| We're not talking about the merits of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Neither the sheriff and I know the mayor's people are here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| We're not talking about the merits of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| We're talking about their fundamental right to have representation in this very complicated lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| that is about a very significant part of their lives, which is their decision to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| So I don't know if that helped you or not, but that's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| We're asking for a lawyer to stand there to protect their interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| And so my concern is the Law Director's office is opining in an action that they brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2923)|
| 0:48:56| And so I don't know if there's a potential, I guess there is a potential conflict in the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| because they're representing both sides of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| So we're essentially suing ourselves and denying representation of the people that we're suing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| And it has nothing to do with any of the work they did as a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| And thank you for mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I did not mention that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| They are not accused, these employees are not accused of doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| All they did was accept the offer that the pension board gave to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| And because of that, they're now in the middle of this storm that half of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I've talked to all of them, they don't understand what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And unless you're familiar with it, you don't understand what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| It's very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| As the Law Director's opinion points out, there's a lot of issues out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| and they are entitled to representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| I hope I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| I guess what I would like is, and I don't know if we can do it over the next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| and it may be impossible, but since there is a potential conflict of the Law Director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| opining on a case in which they're filing action, I guess maybe an Attorney General's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| from the state of Tennessee to see if there is a potential conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| because I think we're treading on some unfamiliar territory here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| and I hope we've never sued ourselves and our former employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| but I think that we need to look at potentially getting an opinion based on the opinion that we got today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| Commissioner Anders, I'm not sure if the Attorney General will give us an opinion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| because it is a charter issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I think Mr. Armstrong and I agree on one thing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| That would probably be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Since it's a charter issue and you've got timing issues with regard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| obviously before the commission meeting, we are also already operating on behalf of those deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| We are operating on an extension to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| because that's one of the problems that we got caught in the whipsaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| when they decided that they weren't going to provide a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| Everybody knows that you have 30 days to answer a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| That 30 days has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| They have extended it one time, and you hate to, as a lawyer, keep on asking extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| so we really need to have somebody come in there pretty quickly and start defending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Hopefully, in the way the resolution is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| and this was what Mr. Caldwell pointed out and Mr. Rice as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| this is authorizing the appointment of a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| This is not a lawyer for every deputy that gets out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| This is seven of them so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| I think what they're doing, and Bud might be able to answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| I think what they're doing is every time somebody retires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| when the pension board adds another person, they add another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| You can see him nodding his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| They add another defendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| So we're not asking for seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| We're asking for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| As long as that one doesn't feel like there's a conflict, a legal conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| a very complicated issue, I think we can get by with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| That way you don't think that this is an open-ended, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| this is a lawyer's get-out-of-jail-free card where we're going to hire 50 lawyers out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| That's not what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| We're going to hire one, and their only job is to protect the interest of those deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| Sometimes, and I can get as technical as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| that interest may be different than the interest represented by the pension board's lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| because the pension board is going to defend the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| This lawyer is designed to defend these officers, these retired men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| that gave Knox County 30 years of their lives, and I think they're entitled to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Before we open this up to any further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I'd like to make sure that we stay focused on the resolution that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| and not the merits of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Not having a whole lot of knowledge of the merits of this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| I think the merits of the case are up to a judge to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| We are simply looking at this resolution about representation for these deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Mr. Law Director, what does the charter say about a retired employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| Are they due by Knox County taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| We're talking about Knox County taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| We could talk tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| by the time this is all said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| So is there anything in the charter that we voted on that defines this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| Well, the charter is very specific on hiring attorneys for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| The real issue here, I was contacted by the mayor's office to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| I looked at the charter, which gives the law director the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| to actually hire counsel for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| The problem with it is it narrows it down to two specific situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| One is if they're being sued for damages, which is not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| We have a certiorari action or an administrative action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| and we have a declaratory judgment action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| which is neither one bringing in these officers for damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Number two is it's in the performance of their duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| when they were employees at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Their pension questions are post-employment questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| whether the formula of the calculation of their pension is correct or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| which would, in fact, affect their pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| So neither of the criteria whereby the law director can hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| for these people have been met, so I looked at it saying I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| Even in consultation with county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| that's the only way that commission can become involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| is in consultation with the law director concerning representation for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| The only charter power given to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| as it relates to paying for employees' litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| is you can vote to pay for their court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| and you don't need consultation with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| because the law director is not in paying for court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| But the hiring for outside counsel is a duty given to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| both by the charter and by the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| In the code, as I said, you all can address court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| The only other time that you can address attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| without being in consultation with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| is if one member of this body has a legal issue and they hire counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| and they are exonerated, then you can reimburse for those effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| But I can't find anywhere in the charter that gives you the power to hire counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| and there is absolutely no power in the charter for the sheriff or the mayor to hire counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| The law director does have one other issue with this particular resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| If you look on the front page of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| it says it's prepared by the Knox County Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| The Knox County Law Director never saw this thing until late in the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| because for some reason it was not sent to the Knox County Law Director for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| and it bypassed the office to get to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| And the law director does have some consternation with some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| because the charter does not obligate Knox County to represent any employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| It's at the discretion under the charter and under the code of the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| and if he deems necessary in consultation with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| This is not a conflict. I'm just telling you what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| It says where they have been sued for actions arising out of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| Well, these are post-employment actions, and this resolution says it's actions arising out of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| Nothing in their employment had to do with whether or not the pension board had the right formula to pay them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| I agree, and I tried and looked to see if I could help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| I can find nowhere in here where the people of Knox County and the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| have given me the authority to help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| If I had and I could, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| But it doesn't seem that we have the authority to hire and spend taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| for people who do not work for Knox County and the actions are not directly tied to their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| And that was the rationale behind my decision to say I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| And there is no power for this body to give the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| in coordination with the county sheriff's office, the authority to appoint attorneys to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| It's against the law of Knox County and the charter of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and there's nowhere in that body that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| So those are the issues that the law director has with this particular document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and I'll turn it over to Mr. Rubel if he would like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| I have to respond to questions from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I'd be glad to respond if you would like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| You're going to hear a lot of legalese that might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Well, I was sworn to the public charter of the Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| And I'll tell you right now, I don't see me voting to pay tax dollars money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| even though those officers are fine men and they served 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| That's not what the taxpayers voted us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| And, you know, there's two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| There's different views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| There's going to be 100,000 views on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| But I'm looking at the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| I'm looking at what is going to be before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| I see a lot of things in this letter from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| Why are we not doing what the citizens of Knox County voted on back in 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| We're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Why are we not 75% and they're getting 80%, 90%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| What I was going to point out is what the law director is pointing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| is the indemnification clause in your charter, and it reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| The County Department of Law is authorized to furnish defense counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| to any employee sued for damages for an act or omission arising out of the performance of his employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| He indicates in his opinion said that they're not damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| They're not being sued for damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| The purpose of his lawsuit is to take a man that is retired after 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| that's making $500 on a retirement, and they're clawing that back to $350 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Now, you tell that man he's not being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| You tell that man he's not being sued for damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| That is an absolutely spurious argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| It is totally without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Secondly, the act or omission that is involved in this case is an act or omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Can you stay in the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| I always walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| It's the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Is he arguing the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I'm going to argue this because this is a matter of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| The act or omission that caused this entire issue is the decision by the officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| while employed, to give up his county-protected, merit system counsel-protected position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| and accept the offer given to him by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| That is an act that he does while he is on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| He decides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| The pension board has already offered him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Nobody goes down there and says, I'm going to retire, and then they calculate it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Mr. Armstrong wants to make it look like they calculate this later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Every one of these deputies that retired went up there and her office and the retirement office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| gave them a piece of paper and said, this is what you're taking home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| This is what you're taking home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| And they made decisions based upon that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| And now they're trying to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| And while I don't want to get personal, it's interesting that we're going to say that we can't use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| county taxpayers' dollars to defend them, but we, by God, are using county taxpayers' dollars to sue them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| That's unfair, fundamentally unfair, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| These people have given 30 years of their lives to this county, and they retire on not enough money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| and now we're going to take some back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| They're entitled to representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I don't want to talk about the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| I'll be glad to talk about the merits, promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| But I don't want to talk about the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| They are entitled to representation because they have done nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| I have one question here that you mentioned earlier in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Do we have, as county commission, authority to hire a lawyer as commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| The only place in the charter, and I cited those in there for you, to hire an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| is you can reimburse for an attorney or you can hire an attorney in consultation to help the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| in the performance of his duty in consultation with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| To hire an attorney through this resolution, I don't see where it's proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| and I don't see where it has the foundation in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| I'm sure Mr. Rubin will have a different point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I wasn't asked to address it, but I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| We are in uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| As Commissioner Anders pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| we've never had a situation where a county law director has sued their own employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| And as a county commission, I do think you all have oversight authority over the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| when they're not doing what the charter tells them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| The charter tells him that if this is an act or a mission, suing my people for damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| which is exactly what it is, that he should appoint them a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| And he's taken the position, and Bud and I are friends, or at least we were until today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| but he's taken the position that he has the right to sue them, but they don't have a right to a defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| As a lawyer, I would really love to be able to sue people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| and to make sure that they don't have a right to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| That is a bad position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| These people have worked their entire careers for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| They're entitled to representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I don't know where their representation is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I don't know what the merits are, but we've asked for a very simple thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| One lawyer, seven people defend their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Well, I think all of us as county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I would say that every one of us when we were out there campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| said that we were for the safety of the Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| And I just want to reinforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| I am a 110% supporter of all of our officers, our first responders and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| because when you have something going on, you want them there before they can even get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| And so they are the most critical and important part of our whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| as our first responders and our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| So, you know, I want the public to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| I'm asking just some simple questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| And I wasn't aware until all this kind of came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| What I want to make clear is these are officers who every day got up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| put on their uniform and went out there to protect the fine people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| And for their families to know every morning when they left out, they may see them, they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| And that is becoming even more true each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| And we're even having a hard time even recruiting officers to go into this for such little pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| So of these seven officers, and apparently there are going to be more from what you say coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| these are officers who have already officially retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| And when they left, they were given, you know, what they were going to be drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| which in my opinion was a contract between their employer, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| and their pensions and retirement that they had planned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And so they've been drawing this amount and now going to say, oh, no, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| we're taking $200 away from you every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| You know, these are people that have given their lives for us and sacrificed every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| And the more you retire, I mean, everyone should be on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| And particularly when you retire, you know, there's no more really seeing any big raises or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| So they've already worked this into their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| And they are being damaged because they have given their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| And when they retired, this is what they were told they would be bringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So how do you change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| I mean, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| But, you know, I'm looking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| How do you change something that was a contract that they worked for all those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| and was told they were going to be receiving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| And, you know, I really want everybody here to put yourself in those officers' shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| You've worked and just retired Carson and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| And then to be drawing a certain amount every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| and then all of a sudden we're going to take $300 a month away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| So, you know, if they had been in the line of duty, we would have provided attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| So where do you draw the line as where they're being damaged or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| I mean, this is, it's really, it's embarrassing, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| It's very embarrassing, I think, to Knox County that we're even having to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| And this is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I've not spoke to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| I didn't know anything about it until all this was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And so I'm putting myself in their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| and what they have sacrificed all these years and with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| And I think this is an embarrassing situation for Knox County is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| And I believe we should support our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| And I would hope that everybody in District 2 that voted for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| and everybody in Knox County that voted for us would think about these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| and what's happening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| So I hope there's a, I hope we can come up with some kind of a solution for everyone on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| The only caveat I would have, and I hate to jump in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| one of the people that has been sued is actually the widow of a deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| that died before he reached the age of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| The stresses that were involved, he died and she had to wait until he would have turned 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| And she is one of the defendants in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I had to call her lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| She was absolutely apoplectic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| She had no idea what, I say apoplectic, she did not understand what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| And that's just, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| When I saw this resolution over the weekend that was submitted to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| I knew right away it wasn't prepared by the Knox County Law Director's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| because of the typos on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| So I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| if this resolution says prepared by the Knox County Law Director's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| who actually fraudulently put their name on there and prepared this document for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| It wasn't fraudulently prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| My office prepared it while I was out doing something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| and I apologize for any typos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| I apologize for the law director, the use of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| because the form that we use normally says law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| And that was an oversight on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| I was not in the office when it was approved and sent upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| And that is completely my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| So nobody bothered to follow up and say, oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| the document we sent you wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Wasn't what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Well, it came from some other office and not the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| As I've already said, what happened is I am out of pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| and I realized that I have got to get this thing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| I am not in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| I am teaching class, and I have it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| And that is based upon a form that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| So that is on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I'm blaming nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| That is on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| I would ask you to not elevate a very formulaic problem with the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| and have it actually look like it is something nefarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| It is absolutely not nefarious when you use forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| The substance of the matter is we have deputies that spent 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| that have defended this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| and now all of a sudden we want to take away a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Am I asking the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| I don't know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I think you accused me in this context, and I'm defending myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| The next question is I serve on the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Number seven, retired deputies, is not going to be stopping at seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| That is going to continue to grow until this case is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Number two is that I'm not aware of any deputy that's retired from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| that's only getting $500 a month based on the 85% of their last two years' pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| So that was the number you said, that they get $500 and it's going to drop down to $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| So why don't you just correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| and say that no one, no deputy that's retired is only getting $500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| I think we're talking about the merits here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| What I was using is a number that is easy to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| that you do when you're making public presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| When I say $500 and then I use it down to $350,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| if it's $5,000 a month and it goes down to $3,500, the issue is the same, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| The issue is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| You are taking money away from these deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| based upon the contract that they have made with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| We know this isn't the place to try this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Apparently it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Well, I think it is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| It seems to be what we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| But I do remember some merits of this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| in that the pension board gave these employees more than the charter told them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| So they were getting more pension than they were supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| And that's why it was taken back, because it did not meet the requirement of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| And that's the Knox County law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| So that's like when you pay your income tax and you pay too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| and you say, I want my income tax back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| It'll work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| So does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| What you're saying makes sense, but we're not here to judge this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| That's going to be for a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| But I would be glad to respond to that in a public fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| He's saying that the charter doesn't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| The charter uses the word salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| And as I began my presentation, that's the definition that is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| However, I think the law director's point is that they have an opinion, you have an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| it's going to go to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| The point that we have to do is are we going to include legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| free legal advice for the defendants in this or people in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| That's the question that we have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| It's not the merits of whether you're a good cop or a bad cop or all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| It's just are you going to provide for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Your light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| I took mine off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| I believe that these officers can hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| And if they win, this board can pay for their court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4348)|
| 1:12:37| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Court costs does not include attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| That's his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| That's why I'm asking for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Well, there's a statement I'd really like to make in terms of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Everybody's out here trying to play on the emotions of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| We have no idea what the court's going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| The court could decide that the formula being used currently will be correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| and life will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| So the county's not taking anything away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| The county's asking the court to resolve a definition, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| that will affect the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Or maybe some way in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| But here's what could be done, and I'm surprised that maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| I hate to get into assisting the other side, especially Mr. Rubel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| but if I were in a situation that they find themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| and the opinion of the law director is that this board has no authority to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| outside counsel for these people, that is my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| I would ask the other side if they would waive the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| and see if we couldn't nullify these potential legal problems that are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| And Mr. Rubel, Chief Rubel and I may disagree on the idea that I believe that the pension board's interest is parallel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4434)|
| 1:14:02| the way they're arguing it, to my retired officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| So their interest will be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| So I would, you know, there's just some legal strategies that could be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| that would not affect the taxpayers having to hire outside counsel if they thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| I'm not going to be their counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| The concept of waiving the answer is interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| except a lawyer's going to have to indicate that he represents them in order to ask the court to waive the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and you don't have a lawyer that is in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| That's the point of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| A lawyer might be able to, and I would assume that any good lawyer, and every good lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| is going to try to keep the expenses down and the time down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| But, for example, Commissioner Carringer was exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| She pointed out the one area that their interests are substantially different than the pensions board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| and that is, is there a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| The pension board doesn't have any interest in whether or not there's a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| They're going to defend their definition of the word salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Her point is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| What happens if a deputy retires and you've clawed his back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| I will use something that Mr. Schoonmaker numbered that he would like, $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| and you said, no, it's not $4,000, it's $3,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| Does that deputy now have the right to walk back in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| I could only make it if it was $4,000, therefore I'm not going to retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| That's not a pension board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| That is an employee issue, and it's a very serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| I've talked to these officers that are involved in this, and a lot of them are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| wait a minute, this is the number that I had to get to to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| and now we're using county taxpayers' dollars to say they're not entitled to it, and that's offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| And I do apologize to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| I do apologize to Mr. Schoonmaker for the problem in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| That was not intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| It was used as a form, but it does not lend itself to the merits of what this resolution is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| which is an effort by us just to get a lawyer to defend their interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| That's all we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| That's all we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Bud, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Well, the bottom line is what I'm telling you is there's a procedure for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| and this is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| It's very clear in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| It's very clear in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| It's not rocket science, and that has not been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| and it is incumbent upon these officers to follow that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| but I don't see when you say damage is being sued for damages, that's a term of art, as you know, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| It's not whether they've been hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| It's a matter of are they being sued for damages, not are they going to be damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| That's two different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| You know that as well as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| So, anyway, I'll leave it up to this board to decide what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| I'm on page two of the resolution, and I need to ask the law director some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| It says be it further resolved that the Knox County Mayor's Office shall be authorized to pay appropriate legal expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| made necessary by the litigation brought against the retired deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| Legal expense, court costs, or attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| Well, I assume they're trying to cover all the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| I'm just guessing because I didn't write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| We've established that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| But is that true, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| The point of that was to make them, since Bud didn't write it, I'll be glad to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| The point of that is to make sure that they pay their court costs, that we pay their court costs, and their attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| That's what the litigation expense is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| That's what it's designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| One big flaw in this thing is the sheriff's office and the mayor, they have no authority, they have no jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| they have no power given to them by the taxpayer to do such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| And this body cannot bestow that upon them because it is specific enumerated duties of another elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4659)|
| 1:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| That's what I'm trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Commissioner Ostrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| I've got a really, I guess, a simpleton question for either attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| What does the phrase, waive the answer, mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| That's more of a legal term, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| It's been used just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| So can you all define it and put it in context, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| When you file a lawsuit and these people are being enjoined into this suit because it may or may not affect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| and you want to put them on notice so that they can be there to have due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| When you do that, when you file a complaint in a lawsuit, which is the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| the law requires that person receiving the complaint to provide an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| either denying, refuting, or saying, I don't know what's going on, or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| And if they fail to do that, you could end up with a default judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| However, that can be waived by the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| That's all I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| I don't want to be the lawyer for both sides here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| but if the attorney, Mr. Burris, as they named here, would be willing to waive that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4732)|
| 1:19:03| then they don't have to hire a, they're not defaulted by not answering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| and they don't have to hire an attorney to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| And so you are already represented in America pro se unless you hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| Some of these people have already hired attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| I do know that for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Yes, I do, Rubel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| You're talking about Mr. Gass who represented you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| He's not representing you in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| I'm not talking about Mr. Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| So anyway, the point is, is that it could be waived by the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| And I'm not the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| That's why I hired outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| and I'm not in privilege to what's really going on as far as that attorney is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| If I may respond to that as well, Mr. Commissioner, it's not just the waiver of the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| And Bud is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| The answer is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| But then you get into defending the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| and that's where the interests of the pension board and the employees that are alike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| for a good portion of it with regard to the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| but they do separate when you get to the issue of what happens if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| What happens if Mr. Burroughs takes the position that, okay, we're entitling your money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| Do those officers while they're in court have the right to go tell the judge, okay, I want to have my job back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| That is an interest that is separate and apart from the pension board that they're not going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| And so in a declaratory judgment action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| that court is going to have to declare the rights and responsibilities of everybody there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| and one of them is going to be the rights and responsibilities of these deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| All we're asking, and I didn't mean for this to take up an hour of your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| but all we're asking is for the right, as Mr. Armstrong said, everybody's entitled to due process when they get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| All we're asking for is that these guys that gave 30 years of their lives to this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| get their representation paid for by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| It is damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| They have been at least the lawsuit will damage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| It was for an act that they had done while they were employed here, and they have done nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Commissioner, we have before us here an action that is done by a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| that in some way we do sanction a little bit for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| but has put us in a position that we shouldn't be in position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| because they didn't follow the guidelines of how you figure a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| From my understanding, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| You're getting into the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| No, no, I'm just asking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| They didn't follow directions, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Number two, they're asking now for us to litigate an issue that shouldn't even be before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| That is a problem with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| and we have been given advice by our council that it shouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| Now, if we ignore his advice, we litigate the issue, which is what we really are doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4908)|
| 1:21:58| that made a mistake, who pays for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| At the end, it's probably going to be the taxpayers in some form, and it will continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| Now, I don't know how we're going to correct the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Any way we're going to go, we're going to damage somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| because some committee that's supposed to do what they're supposed to do did not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4934)|
| 1:22:23| That's the big issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| And I have a problem with that committee for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Go ahead, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| I would like to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| The question before the court is an interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| and not whether a committee got it right or a committee got it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| The court's going to look at it and interpret the meaning of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| and from that will be the directions as to how this administrative board will practice in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| All the law directors want clarity to that definition and calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| On behalf of the taxpayers, I have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| These other issues are peripheral to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| and if I truly could find a way in my heart to agree with the chief on this issue, he knows in my heart I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| I just can't get there, and I don't see where this commission has the authority to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| First, I want to make it known to everybody out there watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| that these are things that are a decade old, that are just coming to roost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| and it's landing in our lap to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| We didn't create this problem, but we have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| All of us have to deal with it, the sheriff's deputies, the law department, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| Bud, are you saying that the commission does not have the ability to set policy to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| to give the mayor authorization to appropriate money for an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I'm saying that the charter is very clear on who can hire outside counsel for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| and it is enumerated power of the law director both in the charter and in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| And you are not choosing to allow us to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| The taxpayers have not given you that power. That's what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| No, they've given it, according to you, to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| No, I'm saying that's what the charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| I'm saying it is the duty of the law director, as written in the charter, to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| It is not written in the charter for commission to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| But it's written in the charter for the law director to appoint outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| No, it authorizes the law director to. It is not a mandamus act. It is a discretionary act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| Okay, so you by decision are not doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Right now, because I have not been able to, number one, no one has approached me under the rules of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| Number two, I cannot find where these people have been sued for damages, and that's a requirement for me to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| So I don't take it lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| If I could find some way to get from here to there, I would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| But when I'm looking at what the taxpayers have approved for me to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| and I took an oath to uphold the charter whether I like the outcome or don't like the outcome, I'm hung with what I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Are you taking that from the language that says that only the law director has right to litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| I'm taking it from the code that I referred to you as where it says the authority to furnish counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5140)|
| 1:25:48| the Knox County Department of Law is authorized to furnish defense counsel to any employee sued for damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| That's straight out of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| But does it say exclusively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| But when it is enumerated under the Dillon Rule, unless it tells you you can, then you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| It tells the law director that he can, and it's my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| I don't build senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I don't pass legislation on funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I don't authorize budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| But I do have the authority to furnish counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| That is given to me as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| It is my duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| And it gives me guidelines as to how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| And in checking these guidelines, I can't get from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| No matter how bad I would like to be with my Chief Mike Rubel and my friend, I can't find the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| And I don't believe that this body has the authority under the charter and under the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| It doesn't say you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| It says the law director has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| It puts us in a really bad, bad situation that I think we would all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| nobody wants to see these deputies have to spend money out of their pockets to defend something that they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| And until that point, everybody had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Yeah, I think before we vote, I mean, the recommendation is obviously to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| But before we vote, we need to consider, I think, that the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| the members of this body that are on the pension board are being sued by the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| And so is that conflict in the vote anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| You're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| I'm not suing the individuals and their individual capacity on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| I am suing the collective decision of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| In my memo, you heard me say the majority of the board did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| I never enumerated any individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| I never, we have never charged any individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| This is an action to determine whether administrative action was proper or not on the one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| And another action is are we interpreting the actual charter correctly on the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5279)|
| 1:28:07| And that's all that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| But my question is every time that somebody on this body, as a pension board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| has voted to approve a pension in the last six years, and they're still sitting here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| are being sued as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| And so should they be voting on this matter as a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Well, there's two ways to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| Number one is they can disclose where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| They're not benefiting personally from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| There's not an ethical conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| There's no $25, $35, $50, whatever you all just voted on to benefit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| And it's up to them to determine whether they can vote fairly, yes or no, on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| As long as they disclose to you that, hey, I'm a member of the pension board and I believe I can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| Or, hey, I'm a member of the pension board and I don't think that I can vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| I just thought it was a proper question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| I don't know the exact answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| I think I would be brought up in court, I guess, if you potentially did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| So I was just bringing that to everybody's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| I have a question for both of the attorneys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| Yes, we like each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| Is there any way that this can go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| I mean, I don't know the merits of this, where I stand on how this should play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| I'm not a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Ultimately, a judge will decide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Is there any way to just cut to the chase and go straight for a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| and let them give us direction on how to handle this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| One of the things that Mr. Armstrong says that he doesn't want to represent my side by giving suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| but I could also give another side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| I could give their side objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| I wouldn't be standing here if they had sued the pension board in a regular declaratory judgment action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| just the pension board versus the county, where they crossed the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And why I'm here is they added seven deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| If what they're saying is, and according to the law, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| and I'm not a pension lawyer, is they cannot, until that decision is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| they're not going to be able to claw back and get money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| It's only going to be perspective, perspective only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| So there's no reason to add these seven individual deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| because as soon as that judgment comes down, as of January the 1st of next year, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| then everybody from that point forward is going to have this diminished pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| and everybody can make the appropriate decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| So if he wants to give me advice as to how to run the case, which I'm not in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| if his appointed lawyer had not added my people individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| I would not be here right now making your lives miserable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| But the second question is, is there a way through motions for summary judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| through expedited discovery processes for this matter to go forward quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| And I would suggest to you, and Bud would probably agree, and David may agree as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| that's exactly what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| This is not a fact-intensive case with regard to who did what, who ran over who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| was the light red, was the light green, all of that stuff that makes a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| This is my definition of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| This is their definition of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| You decide, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| So I think that that can happen, but I'm not the lawyer on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I'm here as an administrator with the sheriff's office trying to protect my people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| That's all I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| I have nothing in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Would Blackwell allow for a clawback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| They would have much more expertise than I on Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| I think it would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Yeah, the court could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| Then let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| If Blackwell will not, in all likeliness, allow for a clawback into these funds of these seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| why don't we just drop them off and go get a judge to tell us what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| I'm not the lawyer in this case, and that's why I'm not the lawyer in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Who are the lawyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| Neither one of us are, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| The truth of the matter is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Under the declaratory judgment action that Chief Rubel was talking about, it could be expedited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5516)|
| 1:32:04| The attorney representing the county deemed it necessary to bring in the affected parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| all affected parties from this day forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| That's a decision that they made, but that's in the CERT action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| I don't know that that's in the DEC or declaratory judgment action or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| I'm about as much into this as the Chief is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| I'm sorry, but I didn't mean to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| There are two actions going on, but my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| or my understanding of the way that the law works with regard to the declaratory judgment action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| is that there is no need for them to be there because of the very difficult nature of clawback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| It is possible, and that's why we're both hesitating under Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| It is possible under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| I don't think those circumstances exist in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| So there is, in my opinion, which is all he can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| there is absolutely no reason for these deputies to be involved in this matter individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And if they were not, I promise you I would be someplace else right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| and you all would be going home probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| We have a public meeting after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| No, we've got a public meeting after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Well, then I would be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I think every lawyer has their own strategy about cases, and I'm not going to debate the strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5589)|
| 1:33:19| I think that the declaratory judgment action could and should be expedited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| I hope maybe somebody is listening to me tonight, but I don't have any power over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| Could we, as a commission, call for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| And the quicker we could do the deck action, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| The chairman was saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Bud, could we, as a commission, call for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| The reason we heard outside counsel is because I represented the pension board in the original gas case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| And I have no power or authority or guidance over outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| because I just don't want to be conflicted in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| So the pension board attorneys and all the attorneys of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| they need to talk to each other and work out these problems if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| and the pension attorney could actually make that recommendation to see if they would waive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| to see if they would non-suit these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| I mean, I don't have a role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| I can't get in the middle of that because I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| That's why I had to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Commissioner Osler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Well, I want to give the perspective of someone who's not a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| but who's been involved in watching this on the pension committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| And also to be clear for my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| one thing the law director said briefly, and I'm going to paraphrase you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| was the main thing is the deck action, the declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| Everything else is like the declaratory judgment is the center of the donut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| and everything else around it is peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| and is not the essence of this question that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| This is all the result of a question that came up during a, I don't want to say relatively general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| a general appeal of a decision made by the pension board that led to research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| that led to this question that we are debating here that's going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| So my point in bringing that up is also we have folks at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| and folks who are probably in this room who don't even know what a declaratory judgment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| As a layman who has a lot of friends who are lawyers but is not one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| this is when you don't go to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| This is not like something on television where you've got, kind of like what we've got here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| where you've got lawyers arguing a case in front of a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| A declaratory judgment, and lawyers, please correct me if I'm wrong in this definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| is when these facts of a case are taken straight to a judge to issue a declarative judgment on the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5742)|
| 1:35:51| This is where this case is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| I think both sides of it would probably agree that that's probably the best possible outcome to get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| We're all here debating this because it's taken a long time to get this moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| and I just really, it was driving me crazy here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| but I had to make sure that our folks in the room and our folks who are watching this at home know what a declaratory judgment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| and I think that's something that both sides have even considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| It's rolling, and that is the real meat and potatoes of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| And moving forward, when we get the declaratory judgment, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| That's where you've cut bait and you're fishing after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| The technical phrase is the court declares the rights and interest as between the parties based upon the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| that they are declaring, that they are interpreting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| My concern here today is that some of those rights that are being declared are the rights of my deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| So we've circled all the way back around to step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Some of those rights, some of those fundamental rights, are rights of seven men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| They gave up 30 years of their lives for this county, were promised something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| and now there's an action being funded by the county that they served to take some of that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| Fundamental unfairness, and we're appealing to this commission to help us correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| What we're asking for is a lawyer to represent them, and I will be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| Commissioner, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Again, it's a decision that I think is best decided by a judge because of the legalese that's being used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5829)|
| 1:37:21| Again, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=5841)|

| 1:43:09| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| Former Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| No, he's standing right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| Mike, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| Give your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Mike Brown, 7320 Twin Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6212)|
| 1:43:43| I came up here to make a comment a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| I'm not an attorney, but I spent eight years sitting where you all are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| and we've been through some tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Whenever the law director says there ain't no way you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| why spend an hour and a half trying to figure a way you can when you can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| Folks, that's not doing your duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| And when a person comes up, I don't care where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| If they ask to speak on an item, they should be recognized and be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| And I'd like a legal opinion on that, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| The truth is that the policy for public forum is up to the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| and you can either speak at public forum or you can speak on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| Most of the time you've signed up to speak on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| It's a discretionary thing of the chairman, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| I didn't come to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| I come to speak on the Twin Creek item if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| But it was approved, and I'm thankful it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| because I live on Twin Creek on the other side of Johnsonville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| and I know that's been a problem for 60-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| It's time we did something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Mr. Chairman, I see some, I guess, are you students out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Would you recognize those, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| Students from where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Can you introduce yourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Where are you from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Which professor made you come to hear all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6327)|
| 1:45:34| We need to embarrass you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| I want to prove that you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Tell your professor you can watch it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6342)|
| 1:45:52| I am Evan White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| This is Max Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| I'm Max Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| I'm Sarah Hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| I teach journalism 230 at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| Our lovely professor, Dr. Fontenot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6364)|
| 1:46:12| who we really do like has us do these assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| and we get to come and take pictures and interview lucky people afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| and write stories as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| Are there any announcements quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| We are going to have our 38th monthly meeting, the Ed and Bob meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| The two at large commissioners are going to be at Henry's Bakery and Deli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| on Tassel Pike there in the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| and we'd love for anybody who wants to come and visit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| It's this Thursday, 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Everybody's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| There will be no votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| but we will be talking to all the people in the Gibbs community who want to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| and meet with us, every elected official, citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| They're all welcome to come out and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| That will be this Thursday, 5 to 7, Henry's Bakery and Deli, Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6427)|
| 1:47:16| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| I'd like to recognize a fellow commissioner, Charlie Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| who was elected Secretary of Transportation Committee for the CTAS or TU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| whichever, which one of those alphabet letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Congratulations to Charles for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| April 7th is Iams River Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| I am a site captain at Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| I would love to have you help me at 930 on April 7th at Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| We have a South Knoxville medication and paper shredding event at Food City on March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| That's the last Saturday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| March 31st at Food City at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| And finally, April 2nd, we have the South Knoxville Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| We'll have a candidate forum for all other elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| That's for commission, school board, registered aides, and clerk, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| I need to clarify something, a bit of housekeeping here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| We did have one discussion item left, and that was the discussion item for Hugh Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| and that was the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Entrepreneur's Center has invited us to come out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6506)|
| 1:48:38| And as I said earlier, the best metaphor I can make is this is going to be kind of like what we dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| the Arts and Cultural Alliance, where they're going to go over the things they're doing to help startups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| tech companies, software engineers, entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| and investors in the startup community for sort of grassroots companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| in particular in the tech area for our business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| Jim Biggs has invited us to come out there for, I guess, an orientation or an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| What I suggested to him was we could look at a date perhaps, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| we don't have to make a decision on that date, but I was thinking June 18th might be a good day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| because we'll be through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| That is a work session in June, and it would be kind of like either the chamber luncheon that we had today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| or sometime maybe before we have our, if there's an audit committee meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| So you want us to think about coming back and having a further discussion about this next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| and with the date of June 18th in mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We can take a look at June 18th, and I could get the exact time and details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| but I did want to give everybody a heads up that that day works for them and it would work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| and we'd be done with the budget by then, so our bandwidth might be a little bit better at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Did you have any announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| By the way, they've already done this for city council as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| and the city council members thought it was very worthwhile, so I asked him not to make sure we weren't left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| So I don't have any other announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Is that Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| Hugh, you're talking about going to their place on Market Square, or they've come in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| It's very worthwhile to see and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| I had just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I sent you all e-mails, and I know we're having the Big Ears brunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| and Mobile Meals is also having an event on Friday morning, this Friday, the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| City council members have challenged the county commissioners to bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| It's North Knoxville Business and Professional Association that's sponsoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| and all of the benefits go toward Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| So, Ms. Gale, you said you were going to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And so we're needing two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| It's bowling this Friday, May 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| And you're with the county, so if anybody's with the county, they still can bowl with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| because we're having a hard time getting four commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| So we're needing at least two more bowlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Bad back, bad knees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Hey, we can put the bumper pads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| They've already said you can have the bumpers, and you can get down, and you can push it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| What time is that, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| The bowling starts at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| We'll bow three games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| We'll be out in plenty of time for that event later on in the evening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| I bowled in it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| It was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Yeah, and I'd already told him he couldn't bow on that team last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| He went out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| He went out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| So anyway, I need two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| It's $25 a person, and it goes for Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| I'll give you $25, but I can't bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Carson, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| You can use one of those kid balls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| And then the other thing I just wanted to remind everybody, to remind you to sign up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| register for the City Office of Neighborhood event that's at what used to be the Odom Hyatt Marriott place for Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6716)|
| 1:52:11| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I thought that was at the Extension Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| Is that at the Marriott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Is it at the Marriott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| It's at Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| It's now called Hotel Knoxville, but it was the Hyatt and then Marriott, and now it's Hotel Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6746)|

| 1:52:33| Technically, April the 4th is the 50th anniversary of this commemorative commission honoring Dr. Martin Luther King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| which is going to be at Mount Cavery Baptist Church from 6 to 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| And I'm simply recognizing this is the 50th anniversary of five, six great civil rights events that are occurring in and around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6766)|
| 1:52:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6778)|

| 1:53:04| Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| This light's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| I had it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| You turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Okay, there's not going to be, okay, since you didn't want to hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| there's going to be a candidate forum tomorrow at the Halls B&P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| You will have, the 23rd will be the Lincoln Day dinner for people who want to come and see Congressman Duncan honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6800)|
| 1:53:28| And anyway, that's what I just wanted to tell you about announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| I'll make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| If there's no other business to come before us, we do have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| I'm going to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Okay, so how about we start back at seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| I call this meeting of the County Commission to order for the purpose of discussion of public input on Ordinance O-18-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6830)|

| 1:54:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Is there anyone from the public that wishes to address this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Yeah, Mr. Staley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| Mr. Boock would like to speak, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6879)|
| 1:54:50| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Yeah, I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| I'll put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| But I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| Maybe one of you guys can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Who requested the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Is this not one of these long-term contracts that we've been trying to get out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| And what is the benefit of changing this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| I'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| I mean, that's just three things that I was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| So I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| Who brought the ordinance forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| It says on it who brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| It came out of the Audit Committee as a recommendation from the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Do you want to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| You want me to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| What it was is in the charter we, when it was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| said that the external auditor could just serve a total of two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| And, of course, we've really kind of hit a home run with our external auditor right now, Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6948)|
| 1:55:57| In fact, a lot of their employees have ended up in county departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| which is great because they come from an audit side and now they're working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6962)|
| 1:56:10| And there's been a great relationship between the finance department, the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6970)|
| 1:56:17| and the Audit Committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| And so the thinking was any time that you switch to a whole new company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| there's about a two-year process for them to realize who the players are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| in all the different departments, figure out what they need to do over at the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| what they need to do over at the engineering and public works department or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| And so you lose a certain amount of expertise by changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| And once this is in place, we can change them any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| We have that right as the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| They're not locked into a set contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| A little bit more insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Where we researched this was what is best practice in the private CPA sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| and found that in private companies, which are heavily regulated public companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| you often see partner rotation versus, say, firm rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| That was what began this whole talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| As a committee, we were thinking about what is best practice, how is this usually done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| And I think Chairman Shields at the time brought up, he said, well, in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| I can't remember the exact verbiage because this was probably a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| brought up in the private sector are common practices to do partner rotation rather than firm rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| We reviewed how that looked in the charter for the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| and saw it's not so much about here is the risk that anyone in the public would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| well, gosh, if you stay at the same auditor, are they going to get complacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| Are they going to miss something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| And that was a thought that I had, frankly, going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| But then I found that really part of the bigger risk is there is a level of institutional knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| of where the past and potential risk areas and problems can be and have been and have been fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| that your auditors see where the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| And when we ask in particular, say, if there's school issues, if there's things around paying for lunches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| some of those things that have been previously identified problems, by staying with the same auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| you're going to still be able to keep some of the knowledge of past issues that we need to watch like a hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| Yet by bringing in partner rotation, frankly, the new partner that's going to handle us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| hasn't worked on our stuff in, I think, over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| And it will be like brand new for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| but will still have some of the benefits of some of the other folks who have worked on the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| who might know where the other problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| We had a, really just to use this as an opportunity to report out, we had a really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| some of you all got here early, we had a really good audit committee meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| And I think as we move forward in terms of the way that audit committee is going to be structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| how we may be looking at managing our audit department and just, well, it's just Mr. Steele,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| he's the only one here, but for anybody who might be watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| the internal audit department reports in to us at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| And I think we are moving forward hopefully to better equip that department to do a better job of auditing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7157)|
| 1:59:24| and our other fiduciary bodies within the county that we're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| And just, could I just add one other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| The senior partner rotation is going to occur this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| and then the senior partner is going to retire at the end of, I guess, July of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| I guess that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Does best practices, like in a lot of businesses that I called on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| they rotated their purchasing agents so you don't get friendly with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Do they do that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Is that part of best practice that more auditors rotate or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| No, it's actually been we've hired them away before they could get real friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| That's been amazing how many employees that Knox County has hired from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Yes, I know we talked about this in depth with Chris Caldwell and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| and your great discussion there and maybe Mr. Schoomaker can answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| You kind of touched on it there and this is a real question I got out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| from not really hearing the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| Let's say there's ten partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| So can it just go back and forth between two or when you all discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| was there any direction on how that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| or would it have to be different people each four years, three years, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| We've had the same senior partner, I guess, now for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| No, the great eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| I'm trying to think how long he's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| It seems like he's been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Did you see my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Could it just go back and forth between two guys or two people, two ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| It would be up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| What I would want to see would be when you rotate partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| that you're always bringing in somebody fresh and new and not go to a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| well, it's not going to be a tag team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| Is that just by discretion or is that written anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| I don't know if it's written there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| I think it's probably by discretion of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| and ultimately by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Well, I would hope they would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| Does the audit committee get say-so over the firm of who they appoint as partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| the residing partner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| I don't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| But Ted Holtz, he was doing auditing the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| He's done a phenomenal job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| what he's been doing with all the clubs and, I mean, doing the audits on all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7311)|
| 2:01:59| And so he's very well versed, has 30 years' experience in audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| So I think we're in good hands at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| I'm not discussing anybody's lack of credibility or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| I'm just saying I never really heard that answered, and that's why I had that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| That's a good question for us to find out before next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| A little bit of history on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| This goes back to, I believe at one time the limit on this contract was four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| and then we had charter review back in 2012 and were asked to extend it to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| I think finding in that time that it is exactly as John and Hugh have described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| that once a firm is in, entrenched, and learns the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| it makes it much easier for them to go into deeper detail in a more broad spectrum over the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| Government auditing is much different than private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| So I think that is one of the thoughts behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Also, I believe the city also has the exact same contract length as we are looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7381)|
| 2:03:10| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| The other thing is the county uses several different software programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| and so with the existing firm already knowing how all that operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| it's easier for their guys to go in and do the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| where if we hired a whole brand new set of people to come in, it would be a long learning curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| I think this is a good opportunity for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Is there anybody from the public that wishes to have any input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| Is there any further discussion amongst us commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| Seeing none, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180319?start=7426)|
