| 0:00:00| Education's October 2nd, 2023 Work Session. Please stand as we observe a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8)|
| 0:00:20| Face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=20)|
| 0:00:28| the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=28)|
| 0:00:36| for all. I don't think we have any elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| out in the audience tonight. Board members, our wonderful student rep, Ms. Ertle, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| not be joining us this week since she is playing in the district volleyball tournament. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| wish her luck in the tournament and look forward to her returning later in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| I also want to recognize our wonderful Hardin Valley teacher, Dana Sherrill, and her students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| who are present tonight to observe our board meeting. Ms. Sherrill is the program instructor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| for teaching as a profession at Hardin Valley Academy, so please help me welcome her and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| her amazing students. Thanks for being here. Thank you to everyone who is in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=73)|
| 0:01:23| tonight. I know we have kind of a full house tonight, so I just want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| that this is the board's public business meeting to discuss items that come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| us for consideration. So we just ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| and please be mindful that the sound carries very easily in this room. So if you do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| to talk to your neighbor or take a phone call, please just step outside to do so. And I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| want to say the board did have a closed door meeting earlier before this meeting, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| was pertaining to school safety. And under state law, the board had that closed meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| so that was not at the decision of the board, but we are obligated to follow state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| so that's why the meeting was closed this afternoon. Are there any requested changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| to this meeting agenda? Yes, Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to add a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| on private practitioners. All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion carries. Motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=135)|
| 0:02:39| by Ms. Horn. Do we have a second? Second by Ms. Byke. All those in favor? Aye. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| those opposed? Motion carries. Tonight we do have a presentation. We're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| off with the advanced NOCs presentation, so I would like to introduce Ms. Allison Flewett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Hello. Welcome, Allison. Thanks for being here tonight. Thank you for the opportunity to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=179)|
| 0:03:12| to you about advanced NOCs and give you an update on the comprehensive land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| plan efforts that we have been undertaking for the past several months here. First off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| some advanced thank yous to this group. You all have played an important role. The school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| system has played an important role as a subcommittee member throughout our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| so we appreciate the advice, feedback that we have been able to glean from the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| throughout this process, so thank you for that. A quick overview of what I'm going to be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| today. I just wanted to give an update on some of the background that goes into our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| but then really focusing on the recommendations that came out pertaining to land use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| transportation, a little bit of information on our policy direction, and then finally talking a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| about the growth policy plan, which is where we kind of are right now, and that helps us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| our next steps and how we're going to be finalizing this process. So we began all the way back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| November 2021 with the inception of the advanced NOCs process, and that took us through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| development of understanding our existing conditions, what that state of the county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| and some of the things we needed to be attuned to as we began to understand future trends. We then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| moved into the development of scenarios to understand the different alternative futures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| that might be out there as we needed to consider the development of our recommendations. So early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| at the beginning of this year, we started that recommendations development process for both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| land use and transportation sections of this process, and we've moved into final plan documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| and adoption. That's going to carry us through the remainder of this year and likely into early 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| So you all have no doubt heard some about the advanced NOCs process and the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| but just to give a little bit of a refresher, really what we're intending to do through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| process is provide a blueprint for the county's future, some goals, action strategies, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| understanding how we can be a little bit more directed in our process for understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| implementation, how we need to better apply our funding in a way that aligns with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| growth that we expect to see here in the county going forward. And most importantly, we see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| plan as a communication tool that articulates the county's vision and helps us understand how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| we can have the private sector support that vision. Some of the things that we hope to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| through this process are things such as enhanced economic development, resiliency of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| thinking about our workforce advancement and how that plays into our land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| decisions. Also, affordability within the county is something that we have been considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| throughout this planning effort, as well as prosperity for our people and places within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| So early on in the process, we developed a vision that helped us kind of establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| charting the course where we wanted to go. We come back to our vision, we come back to our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| really throughout the development of our scenarios and our recommendations to help us understand if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| we are on track and that we're adequately reflecting the needs of what we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| our stakeholders and the public. But our overall vision was identified as a thriving county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| that honors its natural beauty and cultural heritage while supporting diverse people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| businesses. And our goals, we had eight goals that were actually identified. I'm not going to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| them all the way through here, but they were community character, conservation, infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| investment, economic growth, workforce, housing options, transportation, and recreation. So you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| see we're really approaching this from many different angles, which you would expect from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| comprehensive planning process. We had a lot of different stakeholders, a lot of important groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| that were involved as we went through the plan development. We had two different committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| We had an advisory committee that were made up primarily of citizens from across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| as well as a technical committee that were more subject matter experts and some of our agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| partners from our member jurisdictions and other groups. We also had targeted stakeholder feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| where we needed to learn a little bit more about specific topics. We had two subcommittees as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| part of this effort. I mentioned one of them early on was the school system. So we were interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| gaining feedback specific to the needs of schools as we were going through this. And the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| subcommittee was utilities. So our utility providers, learning a little bit more from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| and some of what their needs are and how those align with what we were doing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| One thing I'll also note is that we routinely reached out not just to the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| and the planning board, but also the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut. This plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| really focuses on the unincorporated area of the county, but we know that it's incredibly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| for us to have a strong connection with those jurisdictional partners because our decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| don't just stop at a boundary. So thinking about our public engagement, this was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| incredibly important portion of what we were doing. We had three primary rounds of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| focused on initial listening and learning. So that's where we're kind of talking about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| vision and goals, kind of making sure we were on the right track for this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Making choices, we talked about our scenario planning and I'll mention that here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| And then coming into that recommendations development process, having folks get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| to take a look at where we were, offer us some feedback, and make sure we are on the right track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| for prioritizing some of those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| So moving us into our land use and transportation recommendations, I mentioned the words scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| planning. And really this is just a fancy way for saying that we wanted to look at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| alternatives. We didn't want to pin ourselves down right from the start by saying, hey we need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| in one particular direction. So this gave us a chance to think about what might happen if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| continue to grow in the way that our current plans and current trends are taking us. But then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| thinking about a couple of different alternate ways that we could grow and exploring those a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| little bit more and evaluating all of those things against some of our goals and some of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| that we're able to kind of measure that come out of those goals. Once we did all of that, we asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| the public to weigh in, tell us kind of what they thought, their reactions to each of those different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| scenarios. And we came back and we kind of took a little bit of the best of everything that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| And that helped us develop what we call our preferred scenario. And you can see that expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| here in kind of terms of general land uses, what that might look like in terms of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| commercial, mixed use, and employment in areas across the unincorporated portion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| That was incredibly helpful for us. Again, we took that, measured it. We wanted to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| how that was performing against our different goals. And we called that our scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| Now you can see we have our three different scenarios and little pink dots that start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| appear here as we talk about our preferred. And the moral of the story here was that what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| looking for to get out of a preferred scenario was something that was going to perform as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| or better as the best one of our scenarios that we had explored. And we were able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| that with our preferred scenario. This is really helpful because we kind of start at that hazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| level and then we start to dig down into more granularity. And that's where we ultimately end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| up with our future land use map. One of the ways that we do that is by helping us define the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| that we're characterizing our land uses. And we chose to do that through a way called place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| And this is essentially a means for us to think about our land uses by providing different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| characterizations. You can see traditional neighborhoods, corridor mixed use, town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| mixed use. All of those are examples of walkable compact growth. We have additional details about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| each one of these place types. And you can see additional ones here as well, whether they be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| rural areas such as rural conservation, rural crossroads commercials, rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| or also suburban growth like suburban residential, mixed residential, corridor commercials or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| business parks. One of the benefits that we find about this place types driven approach is that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| allows us to have a little bit more flexibility in the way that we consider housing and housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| types and the way that those are all factored in to our land use planning. So once we have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| place types defined and established, we needed to create our future land use map. So we developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| those detailed definitions for our place types and then applied them across the area, kind of took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| that hazy preferred and got more and more granular thinking about how we apply those place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| There might need to be different rules to how that's done, special factors like utility capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| historic districts, of course considering our previous plans. And that's what allowed us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| arrive at our future land use map. Of course it's a big county, probably hard to dig into all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| details right there. I certainly invite any of y'all that are interested in learning more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| this to check this out online where we have all of this information posted. But essentially this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| just provides us more information to understand how all of those place types are coming into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| with our future land use map. This is going to be our starting point. I think many of you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| likely aware that the county is also embarking on the update of its unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| And this is a complement, a helpful first step to understand what this should look like, what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| right choices are that we might want to make in terms of land use in the county, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| understanding some of what the rulebook should look like. That's really what the next step is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| through the UDO. Transportation recommendations, also an incredibly important point. I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| all have discussed these in a previous meeting. Essentially we're looking at these by different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| types, whether they be safety oriented projects, capacity adding projects, modernization projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| which is where we're talking about taking a roadway facility that maybe isn't quite up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| the standards that we'd like it to be and adding something to that, be it shoulders, additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| lane width, kind of making it a safer and more acceptable roadway. And then also multimodal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| accommodations. The county has been very proactive over the years about greenway planning and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| that integrates in with some of our other facilities, so we certainly wanted to carry that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| One of the things that's unique for our plan is thinking about this kind of one step forward. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| we didn't stop at the recommendations identification process. We took that the next step to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| what we thought the funding levels might be. We're really thinking about those county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| facilities now. Our plan doesn't look at the statewide roads that we have. It doesn't look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| at the interstate because we know that the TPO is doing that through the metropolitan transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| plan. So we wanted to understand how can the county better allocate some of its resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| for transportation. So we understood some of the different project types that we wanted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| out there, how we might want to allocate that money. We actually took that the next step by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| prioritizing specific projects and understanding how those might be allocated throughout the life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| of our plan. So that gives a financially constrained perspective of how we think we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| those resources going forward. One other element of our plan that I think is notable is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| considered the fiscal impact of what is happening in terms of growth for the county. And this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| really kind of looking at the revenues in terms of property tax, sales tax, and then cost to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| So what is that difference? Are we spending more in serving some of those land uses that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| to be coming out there in the future than we're bringing in in terms of revenue? Or are we having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| a positive fiscal impact where we're bringing in more revenue from those areas than it takes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| serve them? One of the things we were happy to see is that if we were to continue our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| planning trends, the status quo, we would see that there is a deficit. So essentially we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| taking in less than what we would be actually paying out in terms of serve those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| However, in our preferred scenario, where we have landed with our future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| there's actually projected to be a surplus where we're going to be taking in more than what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| takes to serve some of those facilities. Just kind of wrapping this up in terms of policy direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| it's important for us to link the goals of our plan to the policies that help us, again, chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| a course into the UDO and into actually making sure that this is an implementable plan. And we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| taken that one step further into some specific actions. And you'll be able to see those laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| out in our plan in terms of specific policy actions. They really run the gamut, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| they're land use, transportation focused, even parks and recreation oriented. And then some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| specific actions as well. Also a plan management cycle. One of the biggest things that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| is we need to make sure that this isn't something that gets stale. We need to make sure that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| is something that continues to be actionable and that we understand when the updates need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| put in place to make this a living and fresh document. And so that was something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| considered as we developed a plan management cycle. Both to understand how we work within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| the course of a year with budget setting and application, and then also thinking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| 10-year update cycle for the plan. Our next steps center around our growth policy. I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| know the relationship of our adopted plans within the county. The 20-year growth plan is inherently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| related to what we're going to be doing, which is going to kind of take the place of everything you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| see in that second row there. The comprehensive land use and transportation plan is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| replace the general plan and the sector plans. So we're going to have one unified document that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| fills the role of both of those items that you see there. We're reconvening the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| committee. State law requires that every city and county government has a 20-year growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| This was last updated during its adoption in the year 2000. So the intent of the committee is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| consider proposed amendments to the plan and allow growth areas, allow growth in areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| infrastructure is in place. Our growth policy committee members, Betsy is a member of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| growth policy committee. We also have representatives from the county, from the city, town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| our utilities, the chamber, and soil conservation. And the growth policy committee is required to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| two times. Our first meeting will be on October 24th, so it's coming up here in just a couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| Our second meeting is yet to be determined. And kind of the final outcome there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| legislative actions from the county commission, city council, and board of aldermen. So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| thank you again for the opportunity. I'll take any questions that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| Does anyone have any questions for Allison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| I just want to thank you, Allison. I know that smart planning is important to our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| And I live in Hardin Valley, so I hear daily about traffic and growth and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| And you know, land use really affects all of our lives, whether it's our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| where we work, how we play, and our recreation. So I'm looking forward to serving on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| in the next steps. So thank you for giving us that update and for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1164)|
| 0:19:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Dr. Reiswick, do you have an update for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. Good afternoon. I want to begin with a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| that tomorrow was the last day of our annual coupon book campaign. I also want to thank all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| of our students, families for participating in our biggest fundraiser of the year. I also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| a couple other updates I'd like to share. Some of these will be on the agenda for later tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| So I just want to share some of these with the public as well. So as you know, we've been looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| for a piece of property in the Farragut community capable of providing relief to the overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| and population growth that we've seen in that region. That's not new to this board. We talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| about that last year as well. So I'm excited to say, and you see this on your agenda for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| that we've identified a property that we believe can provide long-term solution for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| It's 41 acres, and this piece of land is not only larger than the property, because some people ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| the question, why didn't we finish the property off last year? Why don't we have some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| we were looking at and looking at those things? This property, this time 41 acres, is larger than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| the property we considered last year. Also with the price, it is 4.5 million dollars, as you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| on your agenda. The property we looked at last year was the 3.1 million dollars, but the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| not included in that, due to where that location was, was an estimated 3.5 million for an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| road that would have taken that total price to about 6.6 million is what we were looking at. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| that was one of the factors in us considering what we needed to do, just what that infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| looked like, and Dr. Adams and his team did a great job looking at that. I'd also say while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| we're on that topic, the other part of that, we felt like the solution for Farragut long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| just to put an elementary school there, might have been a little short-sighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| for what we're trying to do. And what we want to do looking ahead, I think you've seen that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Dr. Adams' commitment to this facility assessment, also to Ms. Himmelgaard's assessment to a salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| study. We want to look at more comprehensive solutions for communities. Lots of times you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| can do the short-term thing and build an elementary school, but those elementary students have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| to middle schools and high schools at some point. So instead of just coming back and asking every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| three years for something different, we really wanted to take a step back and look at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| larger and had more capacity. And we think that this property gives us that with these 41 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| So in short, that this overall would be roughly $2 million less than what we would have had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| invest in the property last time. So I feel confident this land will provide the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| that we need. And I'm also going to ask that the board approve this tonight. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| I know we'll have discussion later on that. I feel like it's our right answer. I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| there's been some confusion in the community about next steps, and I want to clarify those as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| well. At this time, as I said before, our goal was to look at everything when we look at a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| We know down the road, again, middle schools, high schools and other kinds of things are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| impacted by that. We also know that communities feel very strongly. You all know in each of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| districts about staying together. We know in Farragut the anchor matters a lot. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| wants to have the anchor. We also know rezoning is always a difficult challenge, as we saw through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Mill Creek and those sorts of things. So just to clarify and kind of officially get on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| I wanted everyone to know our plan will be to look at the property today. We think that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| the right thing. As you know, property is hard to find in Farragut. This property is in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| proper in the town of Farragut. We've worked with the city officials there, as well as the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| to try to find property and have looked hard for over a year. I know Ms. Horn has been part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| those conversations, too, as we've gone on throughout the past year. But I want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| about what next steps will be. So our guests, I mean, our ask tonight is to have the purchase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| the property. At our quarterly meeting later this month in October, Dr. Adams will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| a presentation that will both show the challenges that we have in the whole feeder pattern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Farragut, where the overcrowding exists. I mean, just kind of off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| Hardin Valley 12 years ago was built to relieve Farragut, and now it's back up to over 2,100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| students. So we see the growth is definitely there through that whole feeder pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| So he'll bring the challenges, the data that are there, as well as some options for the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| to consider and for the public to see what some of those options for a Farragut solution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| And then our plan will be, after the board sees that, to then hold community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| talk to the community at large and get input there as well, and then circle back in the coming months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| with our greatest, our top recommendation, kind of what we do with Mill Creek. We brought all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| the recommendations we had, but we kind of had one that we felt was the best after getting all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| that input. So I think there was some information out this weekend, and I thought it was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| for me to say that, that this is not a done deal. And I think there were different scenarios put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| that we started hearing through different social media, spent most of the weekend on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| thinking through those things, and just wanted to clarify that for you, the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| as well as the public. But we look forward to that. I think there's a long-term action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| we can take for Farragut to help them out. Another item I'm also pleased to share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| you'll see, and again this is for the public, because we had a long conversation about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| annual action plan in the board retreat a couple weeks ago. So we're excited to bring that 23-24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| annual action plan. You'll recall that this was a new tool that we introduced last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I think kudos to our REA team and Dr. Lautner. So I'll go ahead and give you that degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| And Ms. Lautner, as we talked through those at the board retreat, kind of where we were on that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| last year, as well as this year. So just want to clarify, too, for the public, that the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| we provided to the board this week has been updated to reflect the new measurable and milestones for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| this year that we talked about. And just to be clear on this, too, the intent is for this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| be a higher level one-year roadmap for the district. Essentially, this plan outlines what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| we're going to do. It's not necessarily going to show you all the steps of how we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| that. If we were going to do that, it would probably take hundreds and hundreds of pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| to look at that. One example would be, if we did that, would be our literacy deep dive analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| that we're talking about. If we listed everything that Dr. Phillips and her team are doing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| literacy, you'd have high quality instructional materials, quality PLCs, you'd have walkthroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| in the classroom, you would have just all these are all the strategies. This plan really is meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| to be more what we're going to do and to measure against those outcomes if we've made those. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I think that's important just for, again, for the public to know this is not an extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| play-by-play of everything we do every day. It's really more the measurables that use the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| can then hold the staff accountable to achieving those outcomes. So our team does look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| another great year of progress and continue to focus on accelerating learning for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| students. And then lastly but not least, I want to remind everyone that fall break is next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| I don't know that I needed to remind everyone that. My daughter tells me that every day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| has for the last three weeks. So I want to encourage families, this is on a serious note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| really want to encourage families to take this time and really talk to your students about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| importance of threats and about safety of schools. You know, we understand we live in a world of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| social media where all these things happen and are real. And I've said this before and want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| again, our team takes threats very seriously. The hours and the man-hours we spend every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| pursuing any leads with our law enforcement partners, that can be anything from home visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| to background checks to, you know, looking at cybersecurity and can't go into all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| that we do. But we do these on a daily basis to make sure we practice our protocols at our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| and when we feel necessary to use those, we do use those because we're not going to take any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| of these lightly. So we do ask as parents that if you just spend some time talking to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| students just about the seriousness of something that can be posted online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| a picture that can be taken, a word said in anger, that's a lot of folks who, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| continue to do that. But if we can be thinking that way, I think it makes a big difference. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| we're doing lots of protocols. I want to brag on our security division just in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| They respond quickly. They respond 24 hours a day. We have people on shift 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| seven days a week running these things down and working with law enforcement. I know because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| get texts on all those and have lots of conversations on all those too. And we are serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| that because that's the most important thing to keep our safe and our students and staff safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| We do things like random weapon searches, something we started this semester, as we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| and we appreciate the board taking action on that. We have begun those and they've gone really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| well. And I think that's another deterrent for us. But I just want to remind people the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| things. One, trust that all of our schools have a highly trained officer in them, but they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| have highly trained teachers and highly trained administrators. They all have protocols that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| they practice on a regular basis. We're very religious on how we track those and turn those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| in every quarter to make sure we're hitting all of those. And then the most important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| if you see something, say something. Like let us know if something feels off. We get sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| random tips from parents. We get students who say something didn't feel right and they tell us those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| We pursue all of those when those happen. And that's what it's going to take to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| keep us all safe and schools being welcoming environments. That's important for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| Just in closing, I just want to encourage our families and staff to enjoy fall break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| As we've said so many times, the process we're on right now is a three to five year journey. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| not a sprint. It's a marathon to get our processes right so that we can do the best for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| kids and all of our staff. So I know I've encouraged our staff and I will do the same to take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| during fall break. Recharge so you can come back and be your best. And we really appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| and hope everyone has a good one. And with that, Madam Chair, concludes my report for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you, Dr. Reislich. I think those are great points you brought up. And I know I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| forward to fall break as well. So I know my kids are. Dr. Adams, do you have a custodial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| staffing update? Yes, Madam Chair, members of the board. Currently out of our 398 position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| we have 90 vacancies. 11 of those schools exceed 50%. We are currently working on a plan to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| back 10 part-time employees who are committed to come back and work part-time. So we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| explore that and continue to explore that and recruit and retain as many custodians as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you. Thank you. We have another presentation. Ms. Paula, you want to come on up? Ms. Paula is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| going to do a Knox County Education Association presentation for us as well. Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Superintendent Reislich. I would like to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| you all for this opportunity to speak to you tonight. As mentioned, my name is Paula Hancock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| and I serve as president of the Knox County Education Association. I am here tonight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| submit to you a petition containing the signatures of Knox County educators regarding continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| and collaborative conferencing. As this board knows, Tennessee law recognizes that a collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| relationship between the board and its professional employees will assist in the establishment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| maintenance of an educational climate and working environment that will attract and retain highly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| qualified professional staff. Collaborative conferencing, or PECA, recognizes the obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| of the board and its teachers to collaborate on matters relating to the terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| of professional employee service and sets forth the process whereby we can work together towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| producing an agreement or memorandum of understanding on issues such as salary, insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| and working conditions. We in Knox County are very fortunate to have gone through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| with the district in the past and have already have an existing memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| which is valid. Your ratification of our prior MOU affirms to educators in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| that you value our work and our opinions. We appreciate the opportunity to collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| on matters that are essential to attracting and retaining highly qualified professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| so that together we can achieve the highest possible educational standards in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| district. So why am I here before you tonight with another round of signatures requesting to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| this process again? The answer is quite simple. The law puts this burden on educators to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=1897)|

| 0:34:30| on that committee. This will take us into our discussion for our October 4th regular session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| agenda. A few announcements about that before we get into the agenda items. I want to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| that the district address in the agreement for item 6C6 has been corrected and an updated version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2084)|
| 0:34:53| of that agreement is attached to your electronic version. Also, without objection, we may have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| item that will be added to our consent items prior to Wednesday's meeting. It is not finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| but hopefully our annual dual enrollment agreement with TCAP will be ready for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| consideration. The Tennessee Board of Regents has an October 20th deadline for the agreement to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| approved, so to support our students taking those courses, we will need to consider it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Miss Coatney will email us as soon as that's available. So with that, we'll go ahead and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| into our regular agenda. So we'll start with item number five, which is our committees, and we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| talk about these committees and roles at our board workshop. Was that last week? I guess the last week, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| I just want to say that I did take everyone's requests into consideration and also balance the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| work and responsibilities of each board member to each committee, and I do want to say through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| process, we are unique as an elected body. A lot of elected bodies, the chair just appoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| people to different committees, but I do like that everybody submits what they are interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| and we also vote on that, which is also not needed, but it is something that we've always done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| and so we will be bringing that to a vote on Wednesday's meeting. So with that, is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| discussion on item number five? Miss Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I noticed that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| Clothing Center is not included on this list of committees. Is there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| That's a good question. Miss Coatney? Miss Harrington, would you like? I know that advisory council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| changed. Yeah, I know there's been some changes to the Clothing Center. I think, so last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| at the board retreat, this was discussed, if I recall, that we decided, you decided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| we would not have representation on the Clothing Center. If that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| the board wishes to reinstate, we're more than happy to have a board member represented, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| think, if I recall correctly, no one had expressed an interest in signing up, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2227)|
| 0:37:16| I'm assuming that was just a carryover. Thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I didn't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2236)|
| 0:37:26| to bring it up at the retreat, but speaking of the annual plan, and I know we have that before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| again tonight, and it references over and over again our current strategic plan, which does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| expire this coming year, correct? Typically, a district-wide strategic plan would take more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| just a couple months to pull off. I don't know what's been done historically, because I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| here in 2019 when the last plan was approved, but does there need to be at some point this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| year a strategic planning committee put in place, and would there be board representation on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| committee historically? It seems like that would be a larger community-wide effort. Again, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| have experience. I don't know how it's been done in the past, and I know that's off the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2284)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, you are correct on the date that it expires, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| I don't know. I mean, I have served in processes in those, but I don't know that I've ever been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| in a position. So, I mean, I'm going to have to maybe defer to Terry or Gary to know. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| I think maybe it's been done different ways. Maybe that's why, but they may know better on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you, Superintendent Roszak and Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, I think the answer is that it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| done differently every single time we've done it over the last decade or more. I know when Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| McIntyre was superintendent, it was more of a staff process. They engaged with a third party to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| make a recommendation on a plan. There was lots of community meetings held, and all of that input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| gathered together for a board vote. The last process, there actually was a board committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| formed with three board members who worked on that plan. I know Ms. Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Ebony Satterfield, and I believe Ms. Owen was on that committee, and the committee actually brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| a recommendation to the board for their consideration and approval. So, it's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| several different ways. I'm assuming even in the second model when there was a board committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| there's probably still a tremendous amount of staff engagement, I would have thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Isn't that correct? I mean, I'm sure that those three, you all didn't just go off by yourself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| make a plan and say, here you go, rock it out, right? Dr. Roszak, again, I know this is off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| cuff, but have you given, I mean, I know you're a planner, which I appreciate. So, have you given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| some thoughts to, again, I'm only stating this because we're like nine months out from when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| next, the current plan expires, and we probably need to be putting some thought to that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I think, if you're asking my opinion of it, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Well, I'm really asking if you've already given some thought to, like, hey, I know it's expiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| here's what I'm thinking we probably need to do, or. No, I mean, I think we, yeah, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| we think about everything. So, I would say this, I mean, I think, yes, I mean, there are a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| things that, that kind of the board charges to do. One, I don't mess with my evaluation, my contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| and annual, I mean, the strategic plan for the district is kind of your all's plan, I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| the staffs involved in it. I'll tell you what has worked, the formula that's worked well for us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| my 16 months, it's hard to believe it's been 16 months, but has been, I think, having some idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| we have had a lot of success, when you look at almost every report that's been brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| we've had some level of an external group that has helped with that, and I'll tell you why that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| been beneficial to us, is it means we haven't had to pull our staff off of their work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| You know, and the whole, the special ed and the student success dive, you know, Mr. Myers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| all of those teams were still able to keep on their work, they weren't splitting time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| running focus groups, and doing, plus I think it, I think what we've learned too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| you know, Ackerman helped with some of that, and we've had, you know, the Katama group work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| with the Region 5 plan, I think one, they're experts at processes, and engagement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| timelines, and focus, and they can manage that project, so that's helped our staff not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| again, have to split duties on what they're doing, they're able to focus on students and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| and I think they know the processes, and I think there's some level of credibility too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| when it's not the people inside doing all of that, and holding focus, or who got invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| and who didn't, I mean, that, like, no matter what, you can't talk to 60,000 people and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| parents, so I think what we have seen work well is that, I mean, some idea of direction of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| we want to go, I mean, I appreciate that this board has been, you know, focused a lot around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| the four priorities that, you know, I'm saying are kind of the work of what any good district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| should be doing, and I think you guys have been supportive of that. We've tried to build, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| many strategic plans, like in the Region 5 plan, and those kinds of things, so, you know, for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| that's been really helpful to do, and that's a formula that we're probably more familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| and seems to work well with the public and engagement too, so that would be my thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| that there would be a way to do that and not take away from everybody else. So, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Dr. Roswick. I think as a board member, and especially with having nine months until that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| plan expires, in hindsight, I think it would have been a great discussion a little bit at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| retreat, but I think it'd be good to start entering into some of that conversation and having some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| that more spelled out. I agree, I think somebody externally helping us with that is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| important, but I also think now that we've done, you all have done the Region 5 plan, and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| assumption is at some point there will be many plans for other regions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| How does that play, if that's the, if we want to continue to work that process, how does that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| into a district-level plan? You know, what comes first? Is it the district-level plan and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| ones feed out of it? There's a lot of, I mean, to me it's kind of exciting to kind of think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| like what the possibilities are, but we don't have much time, and so I think it'd be good to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| formally bring a recommendation about that process. Not that it needs to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| but I think the board should be in the know about how it's going to be done, and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| what the role we need to be playing in it, because I do think there probably is a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| that we need to be playing in it more than just approving it at the end, so. I just, I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| add, you know, in our minds a lot of this work we're doing around these strategic initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| we think, you know, they have been nice kind of reports and that sort of thing. I think those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| would be great things to hand to a third party as kind of artifacts, beginning of the work on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| To your question about, you know, chicken or egg, which comes first, I think, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| overall strategic plan, the way I see it, is what sets the scope for the district, and then those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| individual region fives and or, you know, special ed deep dive or literature deep dive, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| kind of deep, tailored to those departments and or schools in those, but they all should tie back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| this greater umbrella of what the regional district plan is. So, you know, I think we would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| to look at some of those stuff, and as far as defining the board's role in that, I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| I'd probably look to the chair and, you know, just kind of, we could probably have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| conversations about, you know, how involved in that sort of thing, you know, you all would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| to be. I mean, we're open to whatever that is or whatever you want to ask us to do as far as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| goes. Yeah, I think as we just discussed, there's lots of ways to do it, and I just don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| I know I personally don't want to wake up six months from now and thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| huh, I wonder how that's going to happen in the next three months, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| So, anyway, thank you. Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think that that's a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| that it is coming, and I appreciate not taking staff away from what they need to be doing. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| think that's really important that we remember that. So maybe, I know the quarterly is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| getting kind of full, but maybe we can talk about it at the quarterly if there's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| and room, and that'll give us a little bit of time to think about it over the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| That's a good suggestion. Anyone else on this item? All right, moving on to consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2710)|
| 0:45:21| item and contracts, items one through four. Does anybody have any discussion on items one through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| four? Five or six? Seven or eight? Nine or ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2728)|
| 0:45:50| Eleven or twelve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2750)|
| 0:45:59| Ms. Owen, yes. I'm sorry, I need to go back to ten. No, no, no. Yes. Looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| CARNS Fair agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| sorry, on page two of the CARNS Fair agreement, there are responsibilities for the CARNS Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| listed, and types of vendors who will not be allowed access to the school campuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and there's a list there of types of vendors who would not be allowed things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| lewd and inappropriate, for example, and I would like to see us add political advertising to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| list because that has been a specific issue that is occurring with this group to the point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2800)|
| 0:46:51| they actually sell vendor space for an additional amount if it's a political space. We can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| inside a school, so I would like to see that specifically included in this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2820)|
| 0:47:11| Okay. Anyone else on that item? Okay. Where were we? Did we do eleven and twelve? Thirteen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2831)|
| 0:47:21| Fourteen? Okay. That's what I thought. Fifteen or sixteen? Item seventeen or eighteen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2841)|
| 0:47:32| Nineteen or twenty? Twenty-one or twenty-two? Okay. Moving on to board policies, and we have the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2852)|
| 0:47:51| alphabet, basically, of board policies tonight. A or B? C or D? E or F? G or H? I or J? K or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2871)|
| 0:48:20| M or N? O, P, or Q? R, S, or T? And I do want to say that these were discussed at policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2900)|
| 0:48:49| so we have had a thorough discussion of these policies. I don't want the public to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| we haven't talked about these policies at all, so. Moving on to eight grants. A or B? C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2933)|
| 0:49:06| Oh, I'm sorry, Daniel. Thank you. No worries. Thank you, Madam Chair. On A, I'm assuming not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2946)|
| 0:49:15| is there any change in the original plan for that grant, or is this just receiving those final funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| with the ESSER 2.0 grant? Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, this would be consistent with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2964)|
| 0:49:34| it's spending the final funds, and no changes since last brought before the board. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| and then similar question on B, that ESSER 3.0 allotment is due to an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2981)|
| 0:49:49| so there's a finite amount of funds in ESSER 3.0, so what are we not going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| if we approve this? Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, you're correct. There's a finite amount of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| so this is not additional funds that we are receiving in ESSER 3. This is a reallocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| of some funds, and so technically this amendment to the application, a complete amendment will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| brought before the board to show you where these funds were pulled from, but because this dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| with a facility, we wanted to go ahead and get this one before you all. So I just want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| clear, and I'm not, I don't mean anything negative when I say this, but so we're being asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| approve it before we know where it's coming from. Mr. McPherson. Yes, I mean that with grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3032)|
| 0:50:46| I don't mean that like. And it's a good, it's a fair question too, because, yes. So there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| couple of places, several places, where, and I'll just use this example, tutors for instance. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| have a considerable amount of dollars unspent for tutors, right, because of the hiring and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| the vacancies and the difficulty, and so that's particularly, that's where our largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3068)|
| 0:51:16| amounts come from, but as Ms. Himmelgarn said, when we bring this back to the board, there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| be some, you know, we will summarize, you know, where some of these changes are occurring. So Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| McPherson, do you feel confident that within any unspent dollars we can find that $350, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| will we be cutting something we're actually doing? No sir, we won't be cutting. Our plan is not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| cut something that we're doing. There's a, it would be funds that are as a result of savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| whether it's from, you know, vacancies and so forth. So it's not like we're eliminating or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| reducing the scope of a program in order to do this. All right, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you, Mr. McPherson. Okay, moving on, item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3119)|
| 0:52:09| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Following up with the grant section tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| on the C, the approved Title IV Stronger Connections grant, is there somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| can speak to the overall focus of that grant and what the benefit is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| I thought that might be why you were here, so thank you. Hello, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3144)|
| 0:52:34| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board. So this was a grant that falls under Title IV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| So as we look to see what, you know, how we could make stronger connections, it's all based on mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| health. So we had to look and see how could we put things together that would make stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| connections with community agencies or within our own resources that we have within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3171)|
| 0:53:00| So we looked at putting some things together, creating new positions. Part of this is building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| an infrastructure for when all this money's gone. Like, ESSER's here and it'll be gone soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| so what we're looking to do is put together structures within our schools that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3193)|
| 0:53:24| mental health and kind of expands on what we have right now. Because we have mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| clinicians are in our district right now. We used to, in the past, have mental health clinicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| and case managers. Over the years, we've whittled that down. This grant, the first part of it is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| provide three more mental health case managers so that we can make those partnerships again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| We're looking at providing two behavioral case managers, which is a new role that we have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| of children who are dysregulated right now and we need to make sure that the staff are getting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| support that they need. Ms. Cook, not to get too nuanced, but for the people out there listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| can you differentiate a little bit between those two positions that you just referenced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| The mental health case manager and the behavioral case manager. So mental health case manager will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| partner specifically with the clinicians that we have on and they'll work on the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| of students. A little bit more clinical than our school counselors who have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| structured process that the state requires them to do. Behavioral case management will look more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| if we have students who are struggling, we would predict that they would have a caseload like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| mental health case manager would be, but they would help coordinate and help support the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| staff, make sure that the kids are getting the services they need. So this is a position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| we haven't had before, so it'll be direct services in the classroom along with coordination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| services that we provide. So that's the two. We have this and we also have, we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| other funding sources to see if we can have more of these behavioral people as well. We also look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| to provide the youth mental health first aid trainings, which is a training that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| really supports, which looks at students or staff or training staff to recognize when students may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| be suffering from suicidal ideation and then what to do. It's a bit like if you have CPR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| you know, if you learn CPR, you don't need to be a cardiologist to do that. You know, if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| has CPR, you know what you're going to do. You step into that space and take care of the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| until the professionals can get there. Youth mental health teaches you that. It teaches you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| what to look for and then what to do until the counselors or the mental health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| get there. So we actually have, we've been doing youth mental health first aid for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| in Knox County. The state really promotes it as a way to support students. So we have, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3365)|
| 0:56:15| trainers right now, but we also partner with the drug commission and we, you may have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| we put some advertisements on the TV. We partner with them so that they can help train us, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| we're going to look to train some of our own staff or some more of our own staff so that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| that training. Our SSOs have training because Jamie Blair, who's back there, she has, I mean, she is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| trainer as well. So we have, we're looking to make sure that people have the information that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| need to be able to support kids in that moment. We also are looking to have additional professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| development, both for our counselors, our mental health workers, and then some principals. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3411)|

| 0:57:05| those are the PDs. And then we have a partnership with UT, which is the Compassionate Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| which is University of Virginia and UT have a process, a program that we're going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| providing supports in elementary schools, part of our character development programs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| to teach just about how to get along. So that's an exciting partnership that we're looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3448)|
| 0:57:36| develop. And then our last part is looking at some of the master's level social workers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3456)|
| 0:57:45| helping provide them the training that they need to become licensed clinical social workers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| providing them that supervision and oversight so that we're actually kind of growing our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| mental health professionals based on the staff that we have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| That's fantastic. Thank you, Ms. Cook, and thanks for the continued investment in our students. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| And your team. Thank you. Any other discussion on that item? Questions? Thanks, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3485)|
| 0:58:16| Items E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3497)|
| 0:58:30| Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had a question on the health department MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| Do we hire these employees and is this a new program? Is this a new, brand new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| No, this is an ongoing MOU. We renew annually and we do hire those folks. Okay, thank you. I couldn't remember. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| Moving on to contracts. Nine A or B. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr. Roswick, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3534)|
| 0:59:05| who's best to speak to this that's here, but on item B, can someone share to us how that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| fits into our overall plan for developing school leaders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Jennifer, do you want that one or Keith, do you want that one? It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| split. I'll give you the one because it's an HR function, but I know you've had input into it. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| you want to take a shot first? Okay. Yeah, so we really had just a small number of participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| I think, I don't know exact number. Jennifer probably knows exact numbers from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I know this year we've got a couple of regional directors as well as some principals and assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| principals within their region that are involved in that work. The bulk of the training that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| get and what they work on in that is really around data literacy and around how to use student data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| for decision making and having data-informed systems in your school. I know a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| scope of those projects that they work on and learning through that system are around how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| coach teacher from the school level, around how to coach teachers around the use of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| and then as it rolls up a layer, that's also what the regional directors are working on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| helping to think through that lens with principals around school improvement structures and using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| data to make those decisions. I think, and I'll let Jennifer speak more to that side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| but I think at this point, this is a system that we've been trying with a few of our leaders just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| to see if there is value in it and to see if long term it is something that we would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| use as a tool to continue to help to invest in our leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| but our sample size at this point has been fairly small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, just to add a little bit to that, this is in line with how procurement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| asking us to approach things as well, to put out an RFP and award a couple of contracts so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| have them to execute on should we have the funds allocated. And all three of these and B are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3647)|
| 1:00:56| develop our school leaders, so to provide assistance to and development opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| for our administrators and supervisor levels. So Ms. Hummelgarn, you're saying that the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3662)|
| 1:01:11| that we execute on any one of these contracts is yet to be told, right? Correct. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| And I'll apologize, if I could clarify, in particular, I was speaking to our work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| Relay currently, and that's the one that we're most familiar with at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| those are back to the procurement piece, additional folks have replied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| and so that's kind of the state we're in right now sampling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3698)|
| 1:01:50| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Is D another one of those for procurement so that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| something available, or is this meant to be for specific schools? No, that is a term bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| contract, so we have something available. Thank you. Sorry, Madam Chair, Members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| Okay, moving on to regular agenda items. Item A. Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3732)|
| 1:02:27| There's been much disagreement in Fairgate about what the plan for a new school ought to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| but what most of us can agree on is that the need to alleviate the space issues that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| in our schools is an issue, and that our schools are overcrowded. Parents have been asking for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| time to get rid of portable buildings, and so there are a range of ideas on what a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| plan ought to be, but for now, I'm very thankful that the contract for this contract, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| of whether a middle school is determined that is needed, or whether it's an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| whichever one is determined is what the determination and the recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| I'm just happy that we have a contract. It's important to note that we are only considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| a land purchase this week. Some in the town may not like this location for a school, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| the administration, and as Dr. Reiswick mentioned, I've been in some of those conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| people in the town of Fairgate. We've been searching for months and months for a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| and there is simply a very limited supply of property in Fairgate. We looked at a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| different properties, and there were, there just are not very many, and meanwhile, apartments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| being built all around us constantly, and so I wish we were building a new school. Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| we're so much, so really far behind, you know, where we wanted to be, but we are where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| and so I appreciate the superintendent's desire to offer a long-term solution for the capacity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| all the Fairgate schools. I think that's wise to take into account the entire realm of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| as we're looking at building. For the past couple of years, the community has been aware that KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| has been searching for land for an elementary school, and so for full transparency, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| that it's important that the public knows now, before we purchase property, that it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| that the proposal could include a middle school instead. So I just felt like that it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| to state that now, before we approve any land purchase. So I look forward to the October 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| presentation to the board, and also to the input from schools and from the public. This will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| long process. I don't think it's being rushed there, but for the moment, I'm thankful that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| have a contract, and I hope that the board will vote to approve this contract on Wednesday. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you, Ms. Horne. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Also, thank you, Ms. Horne, and thank you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| the administration. I appreciate you all. There's a lot of work to get into an initial contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| and we had one that was proposed already, and so to be willing to put the brakes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| and say, hey, we think there might be something better, I think shows leadership, because too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| often times we get into things, and I'm not saying us personally as a board, you just get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| things and you're like, oh my gosh, I wish I didn't pull the trigger on that, and I'm glad we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| in this situation here. So I have to believe that it's got to be better than the original one, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| you would have kept the original one. So I appreciate the work, Dr. Adams, and of all the others that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| have helped with that, and look forward to the conversation. Dr. Roswick, I know that the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| is not clear in terms of what we're going to execute, but I appreciate your posture in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| hey, we need to look further out and make sure that we're addressing the things that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| to be coming. Too many times in leadership, it's easy to take the thing that's right in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| you, and I think that's one of the challenges any system like ours has, is we're also correcting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| some of that short sightedness from the past, right? And we've all done that in our own homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| and our businesses and all those things, and so I appreciate you and the team being forward-looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| and hope we'll continue to apply that kind of thinking to other decision making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| which is another reason why I brought the strategic plan. So just a little plug there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Christie. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm not opposed to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| purchase. I did have someone reach out to me, though, asking about property on Ivy Farms Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4003)|
| 1:06:54| and of course, because of sunshine, I can't call Susan up and ask her about it. So I did reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| to the mayor and vice mayor today to ask for insights on that property, and one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| someone from their office had responded back, and one of the things that was cited was zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| that it was zoned residential, and I don't necessarily need an answer on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| but I am curious if there are any rules, and this might be for you, Mr. Dupler or Mr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| at the state level regarding zoning in schools with growth what it is across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| You know, this could be something that we run into later when we need new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| I'm curious about if there are any special rules regarding that. I don't need an answer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4058)|
| 1:07:50| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| Long ago, and I may remember this incorrectly, but it seems to me that the way this board used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| to consider land was to have a presentation of all of the possibilities that had been considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4085)|
| 1:08:13| and the reasons that those pieces of land were either appropriate or not appropriate for our use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| and I think Ms. Christie's question adds some validity to why we need to have that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| discussion. It seems like we are being brought one option without necessarily reasons for that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4106)|
| 1:08:41| The other concern, well the reason I have this concern, is when we were building Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| Middle School, if you recall, we kept hearing what things could not be done because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| limitations of the property. We can't build it any larger because of the limitations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| property. We can't do certain things with the road structure because of the limitations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| property, and none of those limitations of the property had been considered before we were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| the middle of looking at building, and I think that is a really backwards way to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| to go and have this piece of property and then figure out how we can use the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| I would much rather have a discussion about the needs and determine what we need, and then find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| the property that meets those needs, and it seems that we're not to the point yet where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| actually know that. So I would like to suggest that we defer this for 30 days at least so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| we can have some more information that we need regarding properties that have been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| or even properties that haven't, and why this would be the most appropriate use. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4198)|
| 1:10:09| Dr. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Owen. I do want to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| because there was a sense of urgency. There were 21 properties that we looked at. Out of those 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| properties, there were three properties that were viable. Out of the three properties that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| viable, one was Mr. Scott's property, which we walked away from. The other property was a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| that is not zoned for a school, and this property. We worked very closely with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| Town of Farragut, and we worked very closely with Knox County Government to vet those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| So I do want to reiterate something that has been stated, and that is there is a sense of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| That is a premier piece of property. We've worked very closely with the owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| If we lose that property, and I'm just going to just be candid and say that there is no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| piece of property that is located within the Town of Farragut that is currently zoned for a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| So, Ms. Owen, I completely understand what you're saying, and moving forward, again, my team inherited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| the property that was under contract prior to me stepping in this position, and we would certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| bring those properties to the board, but because of the sense of urgency, we were fortunate to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| this property. The owner of this piece of property wanted to do this for the school district, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| again, that is a very sought-out piece of property, and it will not be on the market long. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| wanted to share that with you, and we can certainly share that information with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| that clearly details the condition of all 21 properties. Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| What I would really appreciate from the administration is having that kind of information, complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| information on all of the things that we're considering before we're asked to consider them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| When we need to come to a meeting and ask for information like that, that's a clear indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| that we don't have enough information to make good decisions. We need that information on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| not on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| Mr. McMillan. Thank you, Madam Chair. It may have been changed, but a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4340)|
| 1:12:30| I believe it was state law that said you could not have a school within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4350)|
| 1:12:40| 2,000 feet of where they sold alcohol. Does that, is that still in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4360)|
| 1:12:54| I'd have to look, Mr. McMillan. You're directing that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| Well, we will look. Anybody wants to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| I believe it's actually 1,000 feet, but I mean, but I can double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| I thought it was two. Could be wrong. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| Mr. Triplett. Dr. Adams, question for you. If we wait 30 days, what's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| we lose that property, or what's the status if we do wait 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| Madam Chair, members of the board, I would defer to Gary as far as the sense of urgency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| and the timeline on the contract that we currently have with the sales agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| but I can say that the owner can pull out if we don't vote on the property tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4427)|
| 1:13:56| Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr. Adams, I can tell you what I know. I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| as Dr. Adams stated, I mean, we've been working with the county, and you know, the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| some very good realtors that they work with, and we were brought this sales agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4451)|
| 1:14:21| and I went through it and made some suggestions, you know, to make it more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| you know, applicable to the school system in the county, but it was my, I was told, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| by the realtor that, I mean, as Dr. Adams has already stated, that this is a prime piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| property, and that, you know, if the school didn't, if the school system didn't want to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| if the school system didn't want to move forward, that they would be looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| you know, at other avenues, you know, in the very near future. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| Dr. Adams wanted to get this on the agenda, you know, ASAP, which is what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| and if the board decides to defer on this, then I guess the answer is it may not be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| at the end of the month. Thank you, Mr. Debo. And I do think, Dr. Adams, when the Scott property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| was discussed, I do think you had brought up the three viable properties. I believe there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| discussion about that. I think Ms. Terry, Courtney may have the minutes on that, but I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| that was brought up at our last discussion with the Scott property. I do have a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| that. You know, there's still a lot of property left to be developed in Farragut. I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| building five apartment buildings right now. There's a lot going on in the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| So, if we buy this property and build a school, whether that looks like an elementary or middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| school, how far out does that get us? Does that make sense? Like, how, in our growth model plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| does that get us, like, 10 years, 15 years? What does that look like? Madam Chair, members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| board, so what we're looking at when we talk about the Farragut solution is we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| across the board. We're looking at elementary, middle, and high, of course, but we have capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| numbers for each level, and so that will tell the tale, and we've got projection numbers that go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| to at least 10 years, right? Now, fortunately for the town of Farragut, you're within a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| city limits, right? And so, with the projected numbers and the current developments, we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| an accurate depiction of what that would look like within, say, 10 years, but they're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| capped as far as capacity within the town of Farragut itself. Oh, gotcha. Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4600)|
| 1:16:53| Okay, where does it start? Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| Oh, right here. Okay, so what meeting was this, Ms. Coon? Do you remember the date? Yes, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| this was in the August 2022 work session when the Scott property was discussed. Okay, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| Babb disclosed that she knew one of the property owners involved with the property purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| agreement for the land in the Farragut area. Is that where I'm reading from? Okay, for a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| elementary school and stated that she may recuse herself from voting on this item. Mr. Watson asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| if KCS facility experts felt this purchase was a good deal. Assistant Superintendent of Operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| Dr. Adams, reported that this property was the best deal out of the three properties considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| as a future school site. Facilities Director, Doug Shover, concurred and said the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| looked at were not good for school sites. Mr. Shover said he could share a copy of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| appraisal from Knoxville's Community Development Corporation prior to the board's voting meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| on August 3rd. Dr. Adams shared his hope that the cost transfer property would go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4674)|
| 1:18:03| Yes, Madam Chair, I believe, Dr. Adams, in that meeting there was some information shared on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| other 21 properties that you looked at at that time, so I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to say I think that Dr. Adams has really expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| this well, that we've met with the Town of Farragut, we've looked at lots of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| and some of those have been referenced before, but I don't think that delaying this 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| would be wise. I think that it could put the land purchase in jeopardy, and then if we get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| point, I'm not sure what we would do. So I think the question from the community has been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| what school, what type of school would be built there, and as Dr. Reiswick has indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| there's time to talk about that. We have time to talk about that. So the thing that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| focus on is purchasing land, and I'm concerned that if we don't do that, that we will, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| going to end up back where we started, and I don't know where we'll, I don't know what the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| option would be. It would not be, I would like to avoid, I would like to build a school in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| Town of Farragut. That would be what my personal choice would be. I think that that would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| the students and the, and the community well. We have a feasibility study that says that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4760)|
| 1:19:30| would be wise to build another building and not to add on to existing buildings. That would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| more expensive. There's not enough land to do that. We already have lots of issues right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| with that. So, so I'm, my concern would be if we, if we don't do this, that we're going to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| putting a school that's going to be outside the Town of Farragut that would be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| because those Farragut schools are the ones that have been, that are the concern. I've also heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| some people talk about the Choteau area. The Choteau area, those students are zoned for North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| Shore Elementary Schools, so that's the reason that that's not kind of in the, part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| conversation is because they go to North Shore, so that's not the school that's trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| eliminated. If somebody wanted to build another middle school in the Choteau area, then what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| would do, you'd split the populations and so you'd end up with smaller middle schools, but we got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| remember that what that does is you have less course offerings when you have a smaller school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| So the fact that we have such a breadth of course offerings for students at Farragut is because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| have the number of students that we have. So we have to be really careful about what we ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| So anyway, I would hope that we would purchase, we would vote to purchase this land this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good memory on remembering some minutes from August last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4852)|
| 1:21:03| Thanks for taking a few moments to read some of that. It actually did cause a question though. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| think what you said, and correct me if I'm wrong, the three properties were not identified, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| assuming one of them was the Scott property, because that's obviously what the agenda item was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| the other two were not identified in those minutes, but if one of those properties is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| we're talking about tonight, what Mr. Chauver said is those other two properties were not good for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| schools. So I just want to make sure, I don't want to, I want to make sure, because you know how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| sounds, right? It's like a year ago we said it's not good for a school and now we're like, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| buy it, yay! So I just want to make sure that we're clearing up the record. Okay. Dr. Adams, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| clarify that a little bit? I know there was discussion, so yeah, now it's getting a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| muddled. Can you clarify? Yes, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I appreciate you clarifying that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| is not the property, and just so the board is aware, the property that we are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| looking at was not on the market. At that time? Yes, that is correct. It is well below market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| now. At the time when we were looking at that property, just to be quite frank, we could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| afford that property. Yeah, it's, am I doing the math right, about 120,000 an acre or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| like that? Yes, and it was at 175,000 an acre. Yeah, so I mean, when I did the math, when I first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| looked at the contract, I thought, oh, it's probably on the cheap for that. I do think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| important for us as we just think about our role, it's always important to consider things like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| Ms. Owen is saying, and that nobody in the public wants us to feel like we're just up here rubbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| or stamping stuff. I mean, that's just, like, we can all go home, we can hang it up, you can get somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| else to rubber stamp your stuff, right? Right, and so to me, that's always the, and I know that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| what you're asking for, but that's kind of the question, is like, how much do we really need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| make a good decision? And some decisions weigh heavier than others. I mean, a land purchase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| affects us for at least 10 to 20 years probably is a pretty big decision, so I'm not saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| shouldn't have more information about that, but I know that's what you all are wrestling with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| the time about the sense of urgency, but also what's appropriate, and then the public's asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| like, well, how are they making these decisions? Because it sounds like they don't have very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| information, it sounds like they just like it, you know, they just think it's a good idea or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| whatever. So I get the tension in that, and I just want to acknowledge that, and I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| the sweet spot is on every decision, but I think that is what we have to constantly wrestle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| and be asking ourselves, you know, what do we really need, what do we need as a board, as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| to really help the administration make the best decision? Because it's a partnership, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| I mean, I think the way this thing is designed is you can't necessarily make the best decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| on your own, we can't make the best decision on our own, but hopefully collectively we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| the best decision, right? Go ahead. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, I just want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| that, yes, I mean, I think it makes total sense what we're saying about being public with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| The due diligence is there, and we can produce those documents, but to Ms. Owens' point and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| your point, that's not what you see right now, and rehashing and looking over those things, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| I mean, I'll tell you, we got to a point that we were starting to say we may have to look outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| of Farragut, and we had those conversations with the town of Farragut that we really want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| something in Farragut. We don't want to put, you know, an elementary or middle school in Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Valley, but that might be where we have to go to get land. So we have, and I think we can, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| Dr. Adams can provide that to the board, the properties, like you said, the 21 that got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| narrowed down to the three that all had various issues to get to this place and this opened up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| so, but the point is taken and understood that all that needs to be on the front side so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| public sees all that too, not just the work we've done on the back side. Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| I'm patiently waiting. Yeah, I was just going to say, like I said, I'm not necessarily against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| this property. It was just the response, that particular response I found to be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| curious because this might come up in the future, so it was more of a question of if we can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| into that and maybe get an answer somewhere down the road, but I do know that we have been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| about this for what seems like forever, before Dr. Reiswick was superintendent and before Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| Adams came back, and so, and I do appreciate the work you've done because I know, you know, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| came on board and jumped right into Mill Creek, and now, now we're talking Farragut, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| that's been a lot of work for you, so again, I'm not necessarily against the recommendation. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| have questions regarding that for future properties. Mr. Diepler, and then I'll go to you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5130)|
| 1:25:39| Did you need to say something in response to that? Well, thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. McMillan, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| going to respond to his question earlier, so yes, you have a good memory, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| I mean, you know, so the state law says a maximum of 2,000 feet. Of course, I was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| sex offenders can reside 1,000 feet or more, so that's what I was thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| but the caveat here is the state law talks about the county is the one that regulates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| beer sales and alcohol sales through the beer board, so the county actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| cuts it down to 300 feet, so you, so believe it or not, yeah, yeah, you can have a, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| you know, a restaurant or a, well, yeah, so the, so the state law just says a maximum of 2,000 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5184)|
| 1:26:36| but the county says it's 300 feet. Sell beer for on-premises consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| within 300 feet of any school or church. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think I have three questions now. On-premises, what about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5212)|
| 1:27:00| to take out like a package? Also, is that the same, does the Town of Farragut have an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5220)|
| 1:27:09| that is different than the county ordinance? And the real question I want to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| I keep hearing that we want to keep this within the Town of Farragut. Have we talked to the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| of the students there about where they prefer the school to be built? Do they want to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| the current zones? Do they want to keep it within the, within the town limits? Is that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| that our parents are saying is important to them, and is it the most important thing to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| Ms. Warren. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Owen, I think that for the most part, I guess the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5265)|
| 1:27:55| I would respond to that is that the parents whose children go to Farragut, they seem to like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| Farragut schools, and so I would assume that they would want to keep their children in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| rather than a school in Hardin Valley area. So, I mean, I've talked to parents, you know, over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| years who, they're, the big concerns that I hear are about the portable buildings and the overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| and all of those things. So, I would assume that because of, and I'm thinking about the, if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| from the Town of Farragut over to Hardin Valley Elementary School, you're in kind of a, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| road that is really not much fun to drive. It's kind of a, it's very windy, very windy, so that's one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| those natural barriers that, I remember Russ Oaks always used to talk about natural barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| that is, that's a natural barrier that kind of right now is the natural barrier and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| interstate is the natural barrier that's there, which those are things that typically the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| system uses in zoning. So, we would have to change the zone, first of all, because if we built a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| over there, then you're getting into the Hardin Valley zone, so that would also include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| Hardin Valley students also. So, it would be sending kids kind of into the Hardin Valley zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| So, I think that knowing the community, they would prefer to have a school in the town, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| in the town. So, we could, I mean, that's, the schools are located in the town right now, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| this is, you know, half a mile from the other location. So, I think that that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| that would be advantageous. I think, to your point, Ms. Owen, about the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| Academy or the Hardin Valley Middle School, I mean, that's a very valid question because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| you know, it's, it is limited by space and land and that kind of thing. So, thankfully, this is 41| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| acres, so we will not have an issue with land being limited, but I also think that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| has to be very careful about getting too far into to these things as a board because then you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| into the point of negotiating with a landowner and you're, that would, could be difficult. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| I think that they're, I know that Dr. Adams has worked tirelessly on this and along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| Doug Shover and Ryan Dillingham. So, they've worked on this a tremendous amount. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| they've done a lot of, a lot of things and I think that's what board members expect for them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| because that's not, you know, that would be difficult for each of us to weigh into those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| you know, to all those in a public meeting. So, they've done a tremendous amount of legwork on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| this and so, Dr. Adams, I appreciate all the time and energy that you guys have spent and your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| because it's, it's been a tremendous amount. I mean, we're, we're so tired of talking about land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| I mean, it's been, I'm, it's just, it's been a lot of discussion and a lot of feeling like we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| getting anywhere. So, the fact that we have this contract is truly incredible and it's an incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| opportunity and I would, I, I think that it answers a lot of, I, I'm so thankful for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| long-term solution conversation because I think it does answer a lot of or it provides for a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| room to answer those questions in whatever way makes best, makes the best sense for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| and the students. Thank you, Ms. Horne. I just wanted to thank Dr. Adams. I had heard from several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| parents over the weekend, several teachers in the Farragut schools over the weekend and Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| called me back yesterday on Sunday afternoon. So, thank you for that. We had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and as someone who lived through the Mill Creek new school, which is great, and rezoning, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| definitely think that Farragut needed a new school like yesterday and I am appreciative that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| being proactive in the long-term growth of the schools and the development out there and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| want to be mindful that we are always including the community, the teachers, the parents, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| whole town because that's where the concerns that I was hearing was that this, the teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5534)|

| 1:32:25| I know that that was appreciated and so can you kind of speak to a little bit to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| involvement? Madam Chair, members of the board, yes ma'am, I certainly can. So, we, we, just like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| Mill Creek, we went out and we had community input. I met with several families, had several sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| where we had one-on-one conversations with families and this is no different. I know there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| is, there are rumors about the middle school, but the reality of it is we will put several options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| on the table. This is no different when we came before the board and put several options on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| table for Mill Creek and we basically said what makes the most sense, right, and we will do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| same. We'll look at, we'll look at feasibility, we'll look at what makes sense for capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| whether it's a middle school, whether it's an elementary school, we'll look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| what do we need to do for renovations, the middle school and the intermediate, middle slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| intermediate. Currently, there are a lot of renovations that need to be done. We've just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| completed the facilities assessment that will show that and I think that that data is important as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| well as we look at how we move forward and so the smartest thing to do is look at all of that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| and put everything on the table and just really discuss what makes sense. Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| Dr. Adams. Mr. Diepler. Thank you, Madam Chair. I've got some answers for Ms. Owens' questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5619)|
| 1:33:48| So the state law and case law says that on-premises and off-premises have to be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| consistently, so they're both 300 feet and it's the enforcement and the rule falls to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| legislative body only. Thank you, Mr. Diepler. Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5644)|
| 1:34:15| All right, we'll move on to item B, 10B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| annual action plan. Any discussion on that item? Ms. Spike. Thank you, Madam Chair. I read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5662)|
| 1:34:30| this and I really appreciate the scaffolding of the four areas and stuff like that, but one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5670)|
| 1:34:38| of the little ones that I had some questions about or some uneasiness about was the excellence in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| foundational skills. Number one action, enhance instruction through the development of deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| content knowledge in ELA educators and objectives. The first A objective is to increase third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5692)|
| 1:35:00| proficiency rates on the TCAP by 1.9 percent. So we've all gone through the third grade retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| stuff. I think that this is a really great goal but what I really worry about is that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| going to make our teachers and us and everyone really focus too much on teaching to a test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| and I'm kind of already seeing that. I saw that a lot last year and I get that we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| retain our third graders and that we want to do these things but I worry about how this goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| kind of an objective is worded and if it could be put in different wording so that we're not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| looking to like meet a mark on the TCAP because I think through some of our conversation last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| you know, we talked about how that the student is more than that and I see that also part B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| is decrease percent of third graders performing below 40th percentile on the AIMS web by 1.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| percent. I really, really like that. I wonder if there is a way that that could be tweaked a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| bit or if anyone else might have worries about us getting to a place where we're really teaching to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| tests. Ms. Lautner. Thank you Madam Chair and Ms. Byke. I did just want to add a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5771)|
| 1:36:21| context around where this particular objective came from. So the state has set an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| that LEAs reach a 70 percent proficiency rate in third grade over the course of the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5788)|
| 1:36:36| and that for the next three years we close our proficiency gap toward that 70 percent goal by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| 15 percent and so what you see reflected here is actually the objective the state has kind of set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| for us. So this was our nod to that expectation not to say that we could not entertain another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| objective but that objective will, you know, remain on the table for us whether it's in the plan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| not just to remain in compliance with state law. Yeah, I absolutely get that and I think that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| know, I know other times we want to stay in compliance with policies and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| but if this isn't something that we're required to have in our annual plan I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| tweaking it a little bit because I'm already seeing even in like talking to some parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| and myself even being in some parent-teacher meetings that there's already being a lot of focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| on it and I'm really worried about that. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. I think this was stated earlier but just to reiterate to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| public that we discussed this quite a bit at our retreat last week so I don't know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| additional conversation there will be but I did want to ask specifically and I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| referenced a little bit at the retreat but I think I know this is something that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| has asked me about this type of data. So on action 11, enhanced processes to address mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| obstacles and challenges, I know we just heard from Ms. Cook today not necessarily specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| about whole child support teams but certainly some of the work that's done in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| It says that establish a process to leverage whole child support team data to identify trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| and deploy school specific supports. What is the data that we look at for whole child support teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5904)|
| 1:38:36| Mr. Myers. Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. Watson. Yeah so this is sort of the logical next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| in the in the evolution of the whole child support teams. Last year the plan was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| implement the teams at all of our schools so the data that they'll be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| for students will be not just related to chronic absenteeism behavior those sort of indicators but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| also their LEA and math data as well to make sure that we're making decisions in the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| interest of students as it relates to their interventions. So we oftentimes equate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| whole child support with school attendance but it's actually a much more robust process than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| It ultimately is about connecting students using that expertise in the room to connect students to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| the resource or type of intervention that they that they need whether it's social emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| behavioral or academic. Thank you Mr. Myers. Can you or your team just produce a bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5963)|
| 1:39:32| list of what data that the whole child support team is gathering? Not the actual data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| just a list of what the data is. Sure yes. Not the metrics themselves. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| Any more discussion? All right moving on to 10C. Ms. Owen. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5982)|
| 1:39:59| This resolution is something that we may feel is not necessarily needed because all of these pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| are laid out in different places. Some of them are laid out in policy some of them are laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| in law but a resolution is is not necessarily something that is making a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6012)|
| 1:40:24| Staff have asked if I would bring this and I brought this in because it was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| and it was specifically requested because we have staff who feel uncomfortable addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| issues that they feel need to be addressed in their schools. So whether that is an issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| cleanliness or an issue of safety or an issue of staffing they feel that it's important for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| to be able to address those issues either with their supervisors or on up the chain as it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| be necessary and whether this is a an actual or only a perceived issue it is an issue for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6058)|
| 1:41:10| staff and they feel uncomfortable speaking with either their supervisors or even with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| because they are concerned that there could be some kind of retaliatory action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| and I wanted to bring this to help ensure and assure them that that's not something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6083)|
| 1:41:33| find tolerable and just to restate all of those things that we already have said and to let our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| staff know that we value their input and to encourage them to let us know those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| that they need to let us know. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6107)|

| 1:42:00| I can speak to that perception. It's really interesting I mean really the moment I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| on the board three years ago I don't know if this is true the rest of you all but I automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| got a sense that some people don't feel like they can say what they need to say in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| I didn't always feel like it was valid because but I did feel like it was true like there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| certainly people I've had people contact me and say hey this is the situation this was what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6140)|

| 1:42:34| like oh it made much better to actually talk to the source because then I might be able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| more helpful or be more directive or whatever and I think some of that's probably true but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| I think some of that's probably just the nature of the beast being a system as large as we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| and very specific formal authority structures you know it's kind of hard to you know I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6168)|

| 1:43:20| some people just don't feel that and this certainly wasn't my idea but I mean to the degree that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| don't know if it'll have a direct effect or not but I don't know that it's bad for the board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6206)|

| 1:44:50| Chair um I I think that Dr. Reiswick would want to hear from teachers and I think he's put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6290)|
| 1:44:59| mechanisms into place however I do think I've just talked with the teacher yesterday who definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| feels this way so I think that still is pervasive it's been that it's been the attitude for as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| as I've been here and I always hate to hear that because I know that Dr. Reiswick has a an attitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| of continuous improvement and so that certainly I don't think is the way he would want teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| staff members to feel so I just hate always hate to hear that and I hate I hate that even as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| talk about you know a new school and and everything in Farragut I hate that teachers have felt that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| way because that's certainly not how I would want teachers to feel and I regret that that's how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| feel um you know in this situation um so um so anyway thank you Reverend Butler I concur that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6338)|
| 1:45:49| I've worked with a number of uh heard from a number of parents uh teachers and even students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6349)|
| 1:45:58| about retaliation once they complain of concern of that uh so uh when I said I work with in my role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| as a former role as president of NAACP it was a constant issue of those who are concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| retaliation I think it's important that the board in this resolution like this say we do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| hear from you you do have a right and it says a responsibility so I think that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6381)|
| 1:46:28| that we don't have to do I think something that we can do to as a board say we do support uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| the uh the reporting of especially the part that says directly impacting uh students in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6395)|
| 1:46:44| I haven't uh really worked seeing as much with this administration because as a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| I started about the same time the superintendent did uh but I do think it's still a concern and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| this is something that I would want to support thank you Reverend Butler any more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| on this item all right we'll move on to the discussion on private practitioners miss Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| thank you madam chair um I've had several calls from folks who have been working to get private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6429)|
| 1:47:17| practitioners approved and I know we had um some emails I had requested some information and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| think some other folks had too regarding the time frame for having those approved and that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| thing um so what I would I guess what I would really like to start with is some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6450)|
| 1:47:39| on the process that parents are supposed to go through to have private practitioners approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6459)|
| 1:47:50| Mr. Myers thank you madam chair miss Owen yeah so um so the process is entirely online um and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| part of the process is outlined in policy we're finishing up the administrative procedure which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| will be a much more detailed explanation of that um essentially when when the parent makes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| request they're sent a link for their portal and that's where they would upload their required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| documentation uh which is you know that's their where they have their proof of insurance they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| have their um their releases and those pieces so that we can then engage with uh the provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| once we have that information the portal opens up for the provider and the provider has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| the the list of required materials that they also have to upload so that's their proof of insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| their workers comp those pieces uh the the thing I think you're really trying to get a get to is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| when it does take a long time what takes what takes the longest uh what it what tends to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| the longest is when we get to the part where the practitioner has to go through the the fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| and background check that is when I get emails that tends to be the hold up is there or there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| sometimes there's a hold up with getting um the information that we need as it relates to the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| of service that will be delivered in the classroom so that we can make some determination as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| whether or not those services may impede the learning of that student or the learning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| others so that tends to be if there is a hang-up where the hang-up occurs generally speaking once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| the requirements are fulfilled it takes about 48 hours to get everything finally done now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| admittedly and Mr. Watson asked me this in the in the board meeting back in July when we passed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| this is very this was very much a process we were building out as we were trying to implement this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| policy because we were trying to move quickly to get services in place for the start of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| year and we have been successful in that I think uh in the in the email that we sent to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| just over 30 requests all 30 of those have have been approved we have zero denials up to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| point again this process like any new process is not without growing pains and we have we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| tried to um be responsive when we've we've gotten feedback from the community to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| make changes to the process to hopefully make it a little bit easier but there are just certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| things that um we we we cannot um for example again if one of the hang-ups is the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| check and fingerprinting I mean we got to have background checks and fingerprints these these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| folks are coming into work in classrooms directly with with students right and so that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| we want to make sure we're diligent about we want to honor the work that's happening in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| classrooms and we're committed to in that policy that these services would not interrupt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| learning process for others so we want to make sure that we're that we're diligent in ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| that that that these services can be delivered without you know disrupting the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| and then in line with our procedures as it relates to background checks thank you I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6653)|
| 1:51:00| um I think once the the complete procedure is set I think that will make things a lot smoother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6660)|
| 1:51:09| um I I also think part of the part of the issue that parents may be having is with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6669)|
| 1:51:18| a difference in language that we're using when we talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| what what I hear you saying right now is that we are looking at um the the learning environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| and how this will impact that student in the learning environment as well as interruptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| to the learning environment and I think we're using possibly some shorthand for that and calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| it principal approval and this is the part that is confusing to parents because they feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| principal approval is not part of our policy and so maybe if maybe if we could clarify that somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6710)|
| 1:52:00| so and I know that the way you explained it is a lot longer and broader than principal approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| and so if we could say that in some way to make that clearer what we're really talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| I think that would be helpful yeah sure sure I think so and you know again as as we went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| this process as the school year started that was a piece of confusion that we had to clear up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| it for everybody right is it really is just it's a confirmation more so than approval right like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| I'm you know confirm is this going to disrupt learning disrupt the classroom or isn't it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| and so I think that's a well-made point we are putting the final touches on the procedure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| and we'll certainly keep that in mind and I think confirmation is a much better word too and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| I don't think I would have put together that we were actually saying something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| because I didn't figure that out until just now so I appreciate the discussion thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| Reverend Butler thank you madam chair uh one question for uh just just to make sure I'm clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6780)|
| 1:53:08| so once a provider is approved for one student if if that same provider is is is coming in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| another student that that shortens that process correct they've already had the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| and all the things there so it would shorten it in terms of the background check yes and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| another thing that's worthy of note is some of our students do have more than one service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| right so in the event somebody's going to be out or something like that uh you know those I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| substitute providers or whatever also go through that same process so that we can again try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| ensure that that student gets that service right so my my point really is is that as you are uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| bringing on different providers there's not so so many out there so over time that that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| will be covered once a provider is utilized by a student in Knox County schools yes sir and like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| anything else we do in the district too like we'll also get better at it as well right like I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| that's it's a new process for for everybody involved and our folks are working hard to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| these processed as quickly as we can um and then you know sometimes we learn something uh really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| you know something really important that helps us speed up right and so I do think it'll expedite as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| we move forward. Mr. Watson. Thank you madam chair um Mr. Myers not looking for a specific date but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6863)|

| 1:56:16| they work on their own time. We should all be alarmed that a person in leadership said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| that a teacher working for free is acceptable. I am sure my son's teachers are not the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=6981)|

| 1:57:55| fact that almost all KCS aides are assigned to a segregated classroom. There are very few students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7075)|

| 1:59:17| within this month's board meetings. The annual action plan recommended by the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7157)|
| 1:59:24| Upon reviewing the agenda, I was disheartened to find that special education services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| were not, were absent from the plan, especially under the banner of success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| I believe it is crucial that this action plan, a document integral to evaluating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| superintendent's performance, fully encompasses the recommendations made by the special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7182)|

| 1:59:55| by the chair in front of the board, and the board passed. Accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| should be the cornerstone of our educational system and this document used to gauge the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7202)|

| 2:00:24| are given the attention they deserve. I stand here before you today, not only as an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| for this important cause, but also as someone who has personally experienced negative and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| inappropriate behavior from a member of our educational team just last week. I had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| encounter with Lisa Wagner, the health service supervisor. While I understand that change takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| time, it's essential to remember that attitudes and behavior can evolve. Tenure and position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| should not exempt anyone from accountability. My interactions with Lisa was prompted by a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| request for the policies and procedures regarding additional training for teachers and staff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7261)|

| 2:01:20| comments, and an uncooperative attitude. Instead of promptly providing the requested documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| Lisa's response was curt and dismissive. She even suggested that I consult children's neurology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7286)|

| 2:01:50| disheartening that a straightforward request escalated into an unnecessary dispute. In conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7310)|

| 2:02:45| which I hope augurs in a new and more positive era in special education in Knox County. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7365)|
| 2:02:52| cautiously optimistic that KCS can move from what I would call a compliance-oriented district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| to a service-oriented district. To do this, however, we need an action plan that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| SMART goals. With this in mind, I have a few concrete suggestions for amendments to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| that has been put forward. First, under action item 10, concerning achievement gaps for underperforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| groups of students, I would ask that you disaggregate this item into distinct items for the separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7402)|
| 2:03:31| groups, which are English language learners, special education, educationally disadvantaged, and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| of color. Each of these populations faces different barriers. The solutions to addressing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| barriers are different. The success or failure in addressing the barriers should be measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| separately. Mixing heterogeneous groups together muddles the analysis. Second, with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7428)|
| 2:03:56| action item 13 on effective communication with stakeholders, I'd like to point out that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| nothing in this item that appears to be specific or measurable. In other words, this item is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| itself what is called a SMART goal. This should be remedied. I suggest that the board add under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| action item 13A more specific mandates. In particular, that KCS develop and implement a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| dashboard on the district website showing key metrics, which might be the metrics mentioned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| the earlier action items, including the disaggregated item that I just mentioned, a baseline for each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| these metrics, the goal, and the current measured progress toward that goal. Secondly, in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| item, I suggest that KCS solicit the input of community leaders and organizations, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| specifically task forces, such as the Special Education Task Force, in developing key metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| so that the metrics are aligned with the goals that matter to the various communities addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| and encompass meaningful information related to those goals. I have a number of other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7502)|
| 2:05:10| that I might make, but I want to keep this short, and so I would also just simply mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7510)|
| 2:05:18| a few years ago, I did my own study of Knox County Schools' TCAP scores, and I actually went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7518)|
| 2:05:28| through and hand put in every single school's TCAP scores for the different groups. These groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| measure vastly differently. At the time, and I have it in front of me, this is 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Thank you, Nicole. I think the time's up. Anyway, the groups are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7540)|

| 2:05:53| Actually, not really a response, but maybe a clarification. Dr. Reiswick, on item 10 that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| speaker referenced, the way I read that with the footnote is that the table was trying to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| short, but it identified it more clearly in the footnote. Is the intent to actually publish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| data in a desegregated form, or is the intent of that note just to identify and define what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7574)|
| 2:06:22| groups are? I do agree that that information is best seen desegregated. I'll pass that to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7582)|
| 2:06:29| Lawler. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, so the intent would be to keep this plan, you know, as discrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7589)|
| 2:06:39| as possible, and that's in terms of the number of words. Yes, yeah, in terms of the number of words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| and just the ability to consume. What you'll see during our quarterly work session is the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| report out on our annual action plan, and that's where you'll see that information desegregated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| and so you won't see the report out as a lump sum total for all three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| student groups. You will see our ELL progress, our special education progress, and our progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7620)|

| 2:07:43| colleagues and some other members of Farragut Primary just wanted to share some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| that we have about what was proposed. You know, originally we had covered, or it had been covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7670)|

| 2:08:21| a normal channel of communication, notice announcements, anything like that, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7701)|

| 2:08:34| and what the plan was for that. Like I said, despite intentions, the teachers and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| the community in Farragut felt blindsided and very overlooked by the sharing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| Considering that plan, I just wanted to speak to a little bit of, you know, some of the thoughts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| that thinking of that plan in that post, we would be abandoning the newest built Farragut school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7732)|
| 2:09:00| the primary school, that would then be left vacant without plans for its use, despite being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7740)|

| 2:09:56| years from now, and that some school board members have connections with private schools, and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7796)|
| 2:10:05| extent that this is true, we really hope that appropriate measures are taken. I know right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| we can kind of backpedal and say that ideas are being thrown out and sharing them though it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7811)|

| 2:10:25| to think of the ramifications of your actions prior to throwing out ideas on social media. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| think that Farragut as a community deserves better, and I know that you all are up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| So thank you. Thank you, Hannah. Michael Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7834)|

| 2:10:45| Hi, my name is Michael Scott. I reside in Knox County. I came here as a supporting husband and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7845)|
| 2:10:52| listened to you guys for a little while, and now you made me come up here and talk. So I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| joke and say, you know, first time here, long time fan, but I don't know what you guys do. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| pretend to know what you guys do. That being said, so from a completely neutral perspective here, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| mean, I don't have a kid. I'm not a PTO mom, if you can tell. There's a lot of confusion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| for me. I mean, it's hard keeping up with stuff. I kind of resonated with, I think it was Mr. Wesley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| over there. At one point he said, you know, so we don't know what it is, but we're voting on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| at which point somebody gave him some more information, but then here we are with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| proposal of this school, which is a significant capital expenditure, asking for more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| and rather than getting more information, we're pushing to obtain it without any kind of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| backing it up. There is data, but we've not seen it, and so like I said, you know, I can be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| bit scattered sometimes, and I like to know what I'm doing, right? So Googling on my phone within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| the first couple minutes, this is part of why I was confused. I like to learn the rules about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| before I go there, so I know how things work, and I can, you know, socially interact appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| I'm hearing a lot of talks in the background about things that are happening, retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| you know, not in the public forum. There's specifically statutory law that declares that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| you can't speak about public policy or do public business in secrecy. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| you probably are familiar with that. There's Knox County Board of Education policies that require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| you to inform educators, or the community rather, that you represent through multiple channels of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| communication. I work with a lot of non-profit charities. I know it takes a lot of red tape to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| get something to where it is here. There's a lot of discussions, and there's no reason it should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| been here at this point when we're hearing about it, and if we're so desperate, there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| options. I mean, I'm not going to, you know, tell you guys what to do, but there's lots of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| You can rezone. You can buy an option, you know, reserve the right to buy something. You're buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| a right to buy, so you can buy yourself more time for due diligence and to, you know, figure out if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| it is a good investment. It's a long-term investment. It's going to affect a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| and so far, I've not heard about what the people want. I've heard a sales pitch, frankly, is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| it seemed like, and again, I'm kind of like my wife, so I'm trying to, because of the time, I'm a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| bit more blunt than I'd like to be. This is a reasonable person, kind of third-party perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| here. No one, right, this is my first time here. Actually, a nice gentleman had to walk me into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| this building when I got here because I couldn't find it, so that being said, I'm a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| community. I'm a taxpayer. This is just my perspective based on what I saw here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| just from a bird's-eye perspective without kind of, I mean, I didn't want to talk until I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| everything, and then I felt compelled to talk, so thank you for your time. Hopefully, I'll see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| guys again soon, and everyone have a good evening. I appreciate you guys. Thank you, Mike, and Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| Chair, that concludes public forum. Thank you, Mr. Triplett. Oh, Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8031)|
| 2:14:01| I think this is only the second time, and it was twice in one night that I've addressed public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| forum, but I do think it's important to clear up public notice on retreats because it is public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| notice. We don't like go away to a, you know, Gatlinburg or something and hang out all year. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| think retreat is probably the wrong word. Yeah, yeah, so can we have some explanation about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8054)|
| 2:14:21| that's done and what was done for this particular work session? I don't know who wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| Yeah, Mr. Diebler, do you want to speak to that? Our work, so every annually, the board does an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8066)|
| 2:14:32| annual workshop, which is a two-day workshop, usually the third week of September. It, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| our meetings are public noticed because we do follow under the Sunshine Law, which means we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| cannot speak outside of the public meetings, and so that was public noticed. We did have members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| of the public. We did have members of the media there, so do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| No, I think you said it well. It's public notice just like these meetings are here. I would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8095)|
| 2:15:02| add that what Mr. Watson said, I mean, you all could go to Gatlinburg if you wanted to, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8102)|
| 2:15:08| it's my understanding you haven't done that for many years because you're trying to save the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| taxpayers money to stay here in Knox County. So, but if you were to go to someplace like Gatlinburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| it again would be public notice just like any other meeting. Yeah, my point in asking for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| clarification isn't about our particular speaker. I mean, he's acknowledged that he doesn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| lot of experience with our school system. I just want to make sure that people who are out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| listening do understand that those workshops do get public notice. Correct. It's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| correcting him. It's just about informing the public in a proper way, so. All the public notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| are also on the website, and I know that's a, you know, something that's a priority for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| is making sure that we have open and transparent government. And I tell you, I really enjoy our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| workshops, our annual workshops. I encourage anybody to come to those. We really, we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| from all the staff members on what's going on in their day-to-day, and then we also the second day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| talk about board business and anything that the board wants to talk about. So, I encourage anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| to come to those. I think they're really interesting. They're full of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| so thank you for that, Mr. Watson, so that we had a chance to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| And with that, we will go into board forum. Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I really wanted to respond a little bit about what I heard today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8184)|
| 2:16:32| about the, I'm trying to think the, I think you said the improvement. What term did you use about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8192)|
| 2:16:42| the Farragut solution? Was that it? The Farragut solution. And I think that what I heard was back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8202)|
| 2:16:54| in August of 2022, there was a presentation that had all of the information about the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8214)|
| 2:17:04| properties and the plans for the property that initially was picked, but then for whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| reasons over time, that was not the right property for us, and now this property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| been bought, and I think that was bought with the understanding you discussed it previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| I wasn't at the August 22nd meeting. I hadn't been sworn in yet, so I have to go back and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| that, but it's there. So, I think that the effort, and I do agree with what Ms. Owen said, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8247)|
| 2:17:35| that bringing it back to us would have been really helpful for us to get that prior to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| meeting, so we could have that information in front of us, but I do think that that's part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| our process. So, I'm looking forward to the McKenzie-Lonsdale-Beaumont, I'm not sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| call that the solution, maybe the Western Heights solution, whatever it's being called, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| looking forward to discussing that and the possibilities. I like the possibility that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| could be a elementary school, or it could be a middle school, or it could be whatever, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| you give the community a chance to say, this is what we see as a whole that we might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| Obviously, it is this board and this district's responsibility to make those decisions and to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8297)|
| 2:18:23| all the things, but I do like the process. I think we can get better at it, but I do think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| process is there. So, I'm looking forward to the MLB discussion and really have an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| the community. I really like the fact that the community has pushed back and said, hey, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| to have a conversation about this. I think that's really important. So, I'm really excited and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| have a lot of hope for Farragut, but also for MLB. Thank you, Reverend Butler. Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8325)|
| 2:18:54| Mr. Watson? Thank you, Madam Chair. I know all of us, ours was, my email was blowing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| over the weekend around the Farragut conversation. When I first started seeing them, I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| why is it blowing up? I haven't heard what they're saying. I haven't heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| information, and I thought, how is that happening? So, I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8350)|
| 2:19:18| I mean, we see this over and over again. I think it's always a good thing when a community is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| concerned about something or when they're confused about something that you elevate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| and use your voice, and I appreciate you all doing that and being here and advocating. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| think there's still a lot more information that has to be gathered and presented, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| know that we know exactly what the plan will be, but I'm sure that you all will be there to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| discuss it and kind of vet it. So, I think that's always a good thing, and I just want to use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| as an opportunity to encourage all of our communities to do that. Like, if you're unsure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| ask the question. If you want to be at the table, come, and we'll try to figure out how to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| seat to be able to hear from the community, because at the end of the day, you know, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| of our speakers tonight said, it's not just my son, it's our son. I think all of us truly believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| that, that we are stewarding your children, and so, you know, I take that responsibility seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8405)|
| 2:20:13| but I appreciate you all bringing your voice, so thank you. Mr. Triplett, Ms. Bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231002?start=8413)|
