| 0:00:44| is not going to be here today as vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=44)|

| 0:00:50| So thank you for your patience and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| First, before we move into the agenda, I'd like to see if there are any amendments to today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=54)|
| 0:01:01| You have an amended agenda minutes from the January 5th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| It has one correction in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| Has everybody, just nod your heads, received a copy of this amended minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| Are there any other amendments or any other documents that need to be presented to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=78)|
| 0:01:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| All right, next I'd like to move on to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| We have three different meeting minutes that need to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| I'd like to call on our secretary, Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Have you had a chance to review these minutes and are they good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| And yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| And also the amended agenda is reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I'd like to get, for each one of these minutes will require a separate motion, a separate vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| So do I have a motion on the floor for the minutes of the gas appeal meeting which took place on December 5th, 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=119)|

| 0:02:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=171)|

| 0:02:58| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Now on to some of the excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| I'd like to now call on Pew and Company to give us an update and a report on our fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| 17 audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| So, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Please state your name for the record through the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| My name is Ted Hotz, and I am a partner with Pew CPAs, and we have completed the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| Late last week, the final reports were finalized, and they will be available electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| through the pension board office going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Did not want to just hand them to you and get lost in the reports as we go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| Really wanted to talk at it from an overview perspective today, and certainly if any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| you can either ask me them today or ask them to me at a later point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| But from an overview perspective, first of all, of course, we covered the audit period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| of the 12-month period and in June 30 of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| We also issued two documents, one being the audit report, which is 60 pages, so a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| of information in it, and also a shorter what we call governance letter or letter to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| governing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| And it basically talks about the conduct of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| It's kind of a boilerplate letter, but it does also reference, there's a listing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| significant estimates, like the pension actuarial study information, and any estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| regarding how investments are valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| It also attaches a copy of the rep letter, which is what management signed and provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| to us, and if there are any other matters, like any other documents, it would refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Like if there's any internal control matters, it would either refer to a separate document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| or in this case, it refers to the report itself, the actual bound copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| So, I want to move on to the report, and again, I don't think you have a copy of it in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| of you, but I will go over it in general terms from a high level, and then we can always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| ask questions at a later point in time, or now for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| But basically, the report includes several different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| First is our opinion, I'll talk about that in a moment, then management discussion analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| which is a high level of summary information, then the financial statements themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| followed by footnotes, which are very long, and then several supporting schedules, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| the compliance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| So, from an audit opinion perspective, we did issue a standard report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| There's one carry forward exception that we have not audited defined contribution balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| prior to, I think, 2011, because that's the first year that the plan audits were started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| So, anybody who had accumulated balances prior to then, we have not tested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| We've always determined that to be not cost effective to do so, to go back to day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| to calculate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Outside of that, it's your standard clean opinion report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| From a financial statement numbers perspective, total investments in all the defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=376)|
| 0:06:29| plans were $331 million at June 30, 2017, $265 million in defined benefit plans, and you add in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=389)|
| 0:06:45| the OPEB plan as well, total investments were just under $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| Total assets, including receivables and participant loans, which were $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| so total assets of all plans held were $607 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| From what I consider a P&L perspective, your return on investment this past year was roughly $66 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=424)|
| 0:07:17| from all plans, $35 million in the defined contributions, $31 million in defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| On page seven of the report, it actually will break down what the return of investment was by plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| Combined from all plans, it was roughly 11.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| So, good returns this past year, but, of course, the markets were better than that in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| So, the returns were good, the market was great this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| So, because of that, you know, your net invested assets, like I said, went up to $607 million this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| and it was roughly $546 million the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| As far as footnotes provide a lot of information about the plan provisions, and I won't go into much detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=482)|
| 0:08:12| Footnotes do also include a reference of the lawsuit that is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| and I know I've had discussion with a few of you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| The state's perspective is, even though it's contingency, the state expects an audit report to be issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| so, hence, an audit report's been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| And, as well, from the pension board perspective alone, if anything, benefit obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| or if anything, would go down as opposed to up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| So, there's more of a gain contingency from an accumulated benefits perspective as opposed to a gain loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=523)|
| 0:08:53| I mean, excuse me, a loss contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| There is one compliance matter noted in the report, and that is review of benefit plan calculations and DV plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| This is a carry-forward matter, but it significantly improved this past year because it was reported in the 16 audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| But procedures have been put in place, so all benefit for new retirees into payment status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=552)|
| 0:09:24| those now have appropriate review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| The carry-forward matter is that we did test, I would say, about 50 different participants' calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and we had two discrepancies so that there still was some risk in earlier years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| and, hence, that's the reason for the finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| But there is going to be a plan to, over time, do a sample recalculation just to make sure that no other issues exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=584)|
| 0:09:57| From an overall perspective, again, the numbers are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| We audited over $600 million of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| All of the procedures look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| We appreciate the help that we received from the pension board staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and I'll open it for any questions at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| Any questions, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Go ahead, Mr. Bratton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Remind me again, when are we getting the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| The report is finalized, but just recently, so I believe it can be sent to you through the pension board office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| I was going to plan to give it to you electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Do you have, have you sent that to us yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| So it's already been sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| We got it Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| It will be sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Just to kind of sum it up, we've got, yes, thank you, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Well, I just wondered, on our meeting next month, will we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| after we get a copy of that audit, to discuss it any more after we, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| On the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| I'm certainly available to come back, and as you go through it in more detail and have questions to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| I'd be glad to come to the February meeting, or if questions are easily answered through staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| then that is fine also, but I would be glad to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| That's how you plan on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Yeah, it's just difficult to talk about something we haven't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Any other questions, comments, concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| So thank you for your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| So overall, just to make it real simple, we had an 11.7% return, which translated in, market-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| we're up 66 million with the total assets under management of 607 million at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| So with your general statement, it's good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Thanks, Ted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Next on our agenda is we've had a request by Stoney Gentry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| a pre-child probation officer from the Sheriff Department who would like to address the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| So Stoney, would you go ahead and approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| And please, if you don't mind, state your name and address for the record when you get to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| I'm Officer Stoney Gentry with the North Carolina Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| And the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| I have some paperwork to dispense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=758)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=779)|

| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=799)|

| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=802)|

| 0:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I think all the Board members have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| First, I would just like to thank you for this opportunity to stand in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| I appreciate everybody I've worked with and talked to has been extremely helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| and I would like to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Like I said, I'm Officer Stoney Gentry with the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| office. Before that, I was Officer Stoney Gentry with the Knox County Probation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| Pretrial Office. What I'm here for today is on September the 1st, 2009, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=832)|
| 0:14:03| Pretrial Release Services was moved from underneath the Mayor's Office or the County Executive's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Office to the Knox County Sheriff's Office. We weren't given, as employees, we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| given the opportunity to change that. It was out of our control, the move was. Currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=858)|
| 0:14:28| this affects four employees within our office. Me, Stoney Gentry, two of my co-workers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| here with me, David Whaley, and Officer Renee Russell. There is one other officer that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| affects, and that's Todd Cook, and he wanted me to express apology for not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| However, he is currently in the FBI Academy as we speak. I'm sure he would rather be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| than PT right now. It affects us four. We were all under the Mayor's Office initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=893)|
| 0:15:04| I have accrued, and probably that's why I'm the one speaking, I accrued 12 years under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Mayor's Office before the move to the Sheriff's Office. Todd Cook, Renee Russell, and David Whaley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| have all accrued approximately six years. What we're requesting is an opportunity to buy our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=919)|
| 0:15:28| time that we accrued under the Mayor's Office. We know there's a lot that goes in with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=928)|
| 0:15:40| we understand that, but we are not asking for that to be just given to us. We would like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=940)|
| 0:15:49| opportunity to buy that. However, we understand that there's got to be a study done for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| learn how much that would be. We may not be able to buy that time back, but we would like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| ability to have the opportunity to buy that time back. The county in every other aspect has honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| all the time that we served under the Mayor's Office, except when it comes to the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| A little background, as far as the job responsibilities and duties, they have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=981)|
| 0:16:32| changed. We went directly doing the same job under the Mayor's Office that we're doing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| under the Sheriff's Office. So there hasn't been change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| So just to clarify, what you're asking is to buy the time back into UOB. So I guess you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1003)|
| 0:17:00| moved into the Sheriff's Department, so you're already qualified for UOB, but it's just the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| so we're not talking about a calculation of the pension. Is this just to, I guess, to get years in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| which might impact date of retirement? That's correct. And thank you. The difference for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| I have 12 years under the Mayor's Office. The difference to me would be the ability to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| with 30 years under my belt at the age of 52, as opposed to 30 years and at the age of 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| Time's the one thing that we can't make. Time is precious. I've just finished battling cancer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1056)|
| 0:17:50| the second time in my life, and none of us are promised tomorrow. And I'm not saying that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| seek sympathy. I'm saying that out of anything we want or anything we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| it would be to have more time. That would be time that I could have going towards my retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1083)|
| 0:18:13| Any of the other members of the board have any questions? Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So in 2009, that was under the Mayor Ragsdale's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1098)|
| 0:18:26| That's correct. And that was his last year in office. I'm trying to figure out why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| with one year left to go as the Mayor, why four employees would want to be shifted to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Sheriff's Department. Certainly there must be some kind of reason. It actually wasn't just four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| employees. It was the whole pretrial department. Before that, pretrial and probation was together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1121)|
| 0:18:51| and they were both under the Mayor's office. In September the 1st, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| the whole department of pretrial release was moved to under the Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| At that time, there was other employees, but as time has went by, some has moved on to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| job opportunities, other employment, etc. And also, not everyone that moved was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1152)|
| 0:19:21| seen as an officer. So they were clerical or receptionists, which did not fall under the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1161)|
| 0:19:31| But currently there's four employees that are under the UOP currently that this would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| I'm not sure. Are you set to get your question, John? All right. Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This seems to be something that is nothing of their doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| that as an employee of Knox County, we should at least answer them and tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| what it would cost for them to do this. It just seems something we should do, and that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1199)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1209)|
| 0:20:09| Did you ask to be moved or were you told you were going to be moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| You were told, so you had no choice in the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| No, not if I wanted to keep a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Gotcha. Well, that certainly puts it in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Okay. Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair. First off, I want to say I agree with Ed and Bob on that. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| to me it seems if you were at desk A on day one doing job A and at desk A on day two doing job B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1235)|
| 0:20:45| to me that's a no-brainer. My question goes back to Bob. What are we looking at? What does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| look like in your world in order to come up with that? Is that something we would do that on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| individual basis? How does that work as far as actuarial? I mean, obviously we're going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| to come out net zero to the plan is what they're asking for, or at least as close as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Of course, markets may change that, but how does that look in your world?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you. We would just make a calculation based on that service salaries with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| projection and determine a present value on an actuarial basis, and then the board could decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| if they wanted to make available that opportunity and under what conditions. So, it's straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| Okay. That sounds good. The second part of my question would be, I guess, for legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| That would probably involve or most certainly involve a plan amendment. Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| The UOP plan is available to officers, which is described as sworn officers regularly employed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1298)|
| 0:21:49| the sheriff's office, and the plan currently defines the eligible class as employees who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1309)|
| 0:22:00| officers hired while UOP was an open plan and defines as an ineligible class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1320)|
| 0:22:14| and not eligible for creditable service under UOP any period of employment in the ineligible class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1334)|
| 0:22:25| So, I think, Mr. Webb, the answer is that if the service for that period of time under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1345)|
| 0:22:36| mayor's office was going to be allowed under UOP, that that would require a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| Okay. Thank you. Ms. Bennett, you had your line on a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Yes. I think Mr. Mason said that right now has to be time falling under the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1368)|
| 0:22:58| and I guess the board's got to determine is that going to be a plan amendment first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1378)|
| 0:23:08| before we can even go ahead with the calculation. The calculation will cost some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| but the calculation can be done, but the board's got to determine are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| be doing a plan amendment, which may open up more questions from individuals other than just this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1399)|
| 0:23:28| group. All right. Commissioner Brantley. Will the plan amendment have to be approved by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1408)|
| 0:23:38| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| I do believe it will. Okay. So, basically, what you're asking, you're not asking for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| amendment. You're asking for an amount, correct? We would like to know the amount that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| have to pay to buy our service if there was a plan amendment and if it was approved by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| board and if it was approved by county commission and if it was approved by all those down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| That's correct. Okay. Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| I think Kim maybe can answer this question. I'm not sure who would answer, but I know there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| other employees of the sheriff's department that were added to UOP at a later date than when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| first initiated, and so what were the what criteria did they determine? Did they go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| and allow them to add time in, or did it begin at the time that they started? If they had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| been employed for a certain period of time, but then they joined at a later date, how was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| handled? The plan that was originally approved in 2007 allowed officers who joined the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1485)|
| 0:25:00| as of July 1st of 2007 to have all county service credited, whether that prior service was as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1500)|
| 0:25:10| officer or in some other department of the county. The plan also, as originally adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| and as it continues to read today, says that an officer who joined the plan after that first date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1519)|
| 0:25:30| would be credited with his or her service as an officer, but not service in some position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1530)|
| 0:25:41| wasn't an officer position, and I think that as far as I know, Kim, that rule has been applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| consistently. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| So the people that you're referring to were already officers, and so that was the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| they counted, the officers in the sheriff's department. One of the petitioners here was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1562)|
| 0:26:11| a detective in the sheriff's office, went to the mayor's office to perform this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| and then returned to the sheriff's office, and in that case, the service, prior service as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| officer has already been credited. He purchased it. He purchased it. He was credited with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1585)|
| 0:26:34| time based on his asset plan balance. The period of time that he was not in the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1594)|
| 0:26:46| has not been credited, and that's being requested, and the other three officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| as I understand it, had no prior service in the sheriff's department, and they're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| their 6 or 12 years from their county non-officer positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| All right. Go ahead, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| I want to ask, the plan as it currently sits, it allows for a similar purchase back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| or however you want to word that, for military service. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Yes. Okay. So that's already in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Up to four years. Four years. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| And the second thing is that I understand your position. You did the same job. We kind of went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| over that, and as far as I'm concerned, from where I'm sitting, I support that fully. There are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| as Commissioner mentioned down here, a lot of things that have to go in place in order for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and I think that's going to take some work on everybody's part if that's the route we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| to go to try to figure out how to peel that onion, because there's a lot of layers there at that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| I appreciate your service and your time, and as far as I'm concerned, that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| I can support. Commissioner Thomas, I'll get to you in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1689)|
| 0:28:09| Just briefly, I don't want to put the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| but I mean, I don't want to go and do a plan amendment, and we get it approved by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| we do all this stuff, and then we come back and we figure out the amount is, and they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| oh, I can't do it. That's too much. So how do we even figure out if it's something they can live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| with and would like to move forward? Is that, I know that Kim said that it would incur some cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1706)|
| 0:28:36| Is there a ballpark on what kind of cost we're talking about, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And I've got a question for the petitioners kind of related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Y'all, in your letter, I've just noticed that you said this consideration will be at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| I have no idea how much it's going to cost Bob to run these actuarial numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| but is that something that y'all would be willing to help with that cost as part of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| you know, giving y'all a fair, you know, looking at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| We would be willing to look at the cost, but we would need to know what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Okay, so would the board request the individual to pay for this then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| I'd say $500 each for each calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| And I don't want to, you don't have your whole team here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I know you can't speak for everybody unless y'all wanted to greet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| I mean, one thing I'm thinking, we've got a ballpark, we've got the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| I'm wondering if, and board, please share with me your thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Should we have Kim go back and pull together all the details on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| One thing I'm curious about is, are there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| similar situations unrelated to your department in the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| that if this exception was made, it would also set a precedent for doing this for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| classifications within the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| I think that that would be relevant to look into too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| So I, you know, my preference would be, you know, for our next, for Kim to do some homework on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| between now and the next meeting and provide us a much greater details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| You know, by then, you know, maybe y'all could come to the next meeting and we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| the cost and y'all have had a chance to talk about that too with your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| If one or more of you are willing to pay that cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| would you please let me know and I can initiate the calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| All right, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Chairman, I think one of the things that we need to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| is that they're willing to buy this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So I don't see a lot of out-of-pocket expense except for this determining how much it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| And then when we find that amount and you present it, then it's your choice to buy it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| So, and then that would be the tipping point, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| All right, are there any other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Kim, is this a common thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Because here's the underlying thing I'm hearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Oh, there's a whole bunch more waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I mean, or there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Is this something that's common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| You would know more about this than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| There are some other people that could qualify under the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Is it a large amount or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's less than a dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Well, you see, I just want us to be fair to all our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| that have worked very hard for us for a lot of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| I mean, so I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| What's right is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| If their job changed, then that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| If there's one or there's ten or there's a hundred, I mean, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I mean, I just feel like the, sorry, new, new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| If the job truly changed with no fault of their own and they were doing the same job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| then no matter, I mean, if it's truly going to be net zero to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| to find out what that is, I don't see a huge risk on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| I think that's, that's, that's only fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| I mean, to me, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| I don't think, I don't think this is something we need to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1938)|
| 0:32:18| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1941)|
| 0:32:21| Next, item number eight on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Applications for retirement for the all plans to find contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| and authorization of credited service benefit based on completed years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| Do I have a motion to approve these applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Make a motion we approve these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| There is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Next on the agenda is to report from our executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Go ahead, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| This is the month where we normally verify all disability eligibility continuations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| and based upon our conversation last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| we're handling these and reporting back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| At this point, as of close of business on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| out of 60 disability participants who needed to verify income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| we have 10 that still have not replied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| We have sent a second notice out to them the first part of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| with a deadline to reply back to us last Friday and we're still missing 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| One of them has engaged us and said they mailed it in, but we have not received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| So I guess I asked the board to allow for one more month to get this verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| and we'll follow it up with a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Some of these people, some of their disability may be the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| that they don't have the information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| The second group are those that qualify as a continuation of disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| based on medical report from the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Out of 10 that have to do that, three of them have not provided that yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| and these are some of the same people that have not done the earned income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| And as of Friday, the dependent child or eligibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| there are actually six out of eight that have not replied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| but of those six, four of them are all in one family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| So we will be following up with them if the board approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| to allow one more month for these verifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| If they do not reply in the amount of time provided this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| then their benefits will cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| I guess I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| We need a motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| What would the exact motion be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| To allow those that have not responded another 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| or until the next board meeting to respond or else benefits will cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2111)|
| 0:35:11| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2114)|
| 0:35:14| Commissioner, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| The second thing is the regroup contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| I have gotten the feedback, I understand, in my email today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| from the attorneys and I will be feeding that information back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| to regroup to negotiation of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| We are also hoping to do a conversation with them today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| to start with the timeline and the transitional process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| So I think we sort of have planned for that conversation to happen later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2145)|
| 0:35:56| I did email to all the board members the information that was discussed previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| about the fiduciary responsibilities, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| I hope everyone got those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| But the information that had been provided at the opening of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| and the information that had been provided at the orientation was what I emailed out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2174)|
| 0:36:24| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2188)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Moving on, it's a report from the Disability Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| I will give my time to our executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| We have two appeals that are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Frank Brown, Jr., I actually spoke with him this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| and I would anticipate having medical information from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| and a medical test he is having this week by the middle of next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and then proceeding with scheduling a Disability Committee meeting with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| The second appeal on Skinner, he has until this Friday to let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| if he wishes to come to the Disability Committee or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| And at that point in time, I will notify the Disability Committee one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2244)|
| 0:37:24| Next, moving on, a report of the Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| The Investment Committee has, well, first, let's go through the rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| You'll see them in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| And I went through there and I didn't see any problems on any of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| because it's been a pretty good month for market ending December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| So it's easy on that, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| However, the Investment Committee has met twice in January, January 11th and the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| And the reasons for those meetings was discussions with USI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| which is our new investment firm that's making our stocks and investment advice to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| And during those two meetings, it has been decided by the Investment Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| to switch from individual stocks to mutual funds for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| One of which is what that's most people are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Also, you won't have so many flip if one's not doing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| that you don't flip it as much as you would with an individual stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| because mutual funds tend to be the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Also, it looks as if our rate of return is going to be pretty good too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| because with Wilshire, our former investment group, we had a minus of $367,224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| Well, under our present one, we're going to have a proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I guess this is a future amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| $2,364,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| So as soon as you could bring that in, Mr. Gross, we would welcome that check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| and we will have a big celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Now, also the other members of the committee, I want them to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| and kind of discuss what these meetings are about and how we came to arrive at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Yeah, I'll go ahead and chime in on this if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| I think, I guess one of the aha moments is we're looking at changing this mix up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and moving to the mutual funds and also our investment policy statement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| My takeaway was number one, through the active man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| it's not just a change away from individual stocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| it's a change to smart active management and mutual funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| And through that strategy, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| we're looking to have higher upside on our portfolios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and limiting our downside compared to the market and compared to our individual peer group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| This relatively simplifying the way we do this is going to save our legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| It's also going to just make overall management of our employees' pensions easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| and with the potential for higher returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| So it just made a lot of sense to go with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| and I think it gives us a better chance of achieving an alpha on our returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| compared to the market and for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Go ahead, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Yeah, I can just underscore basically everything that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| The ability to streamline the process takes some of the liability off with the trade tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| The things that we were doing somewhat in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| to put that back on the professionals is a big change in our direction in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| Also, the ability to look at our portfolio across all three plans from one lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| to be able to change and diversify those funds individually per plan is, I think, a big benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| And I can't say enough about Bob and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Great, as far as everything I've seen has been top-notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| So I just want to commend those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| And I also, everything that's already been discussed, I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| I think this is a good opportunity for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| I also think that one of the problems we had with our prior firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| is when there were underperforming assets, there wasn't this immediate attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| to resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| They kept delaying, delaying, delaying, delaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| And each time we kept going down further and further and further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| And so I think under the new program, those issues will be addressed correctly and quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| Mr. Chairman, could we give Bob Cross with USI an opportunity to speak about this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Yeah, go ahead, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And I, can I tell you how much I appreciate those kind comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Echo again the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| First and foremost, we did recommend the utilization of the mutual fund approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| One, that enables us across 18 different types of asset categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| to maximize the opportunity for diversification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| And second, I would note that we are 100% using institutional share classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| And those are the most economical, most efficient share classes available in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| It does enable us to structure a portfolio based on historical performance over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| with an upcapture of 102% plus, and a capture of the downside of the market, around 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| So what that does, again, is enable us in hopefully going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| to have the same realization that we capture more of the upmarket and less of the downmarket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| We also have done significant Monte Carlo simulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| which would indicate that with a reasonable degree of confidence, 95%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| of using statistical analysis, that we can expect drawdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| And that would be a decline in the overall portfolio when we do have a market decline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| which would be considerably less than that would be expected in a typical portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| So we think by using the funds, again, using institutional share classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| we can have the proper diversification, protect ourselves on the downside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| and also realize a gain on the upside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| All the projections show that we can and should accumulate the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| or make the actual assumption over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| And currently it's 7%, which I would note is among the top 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| more conservative and most conservative assumption across plans in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| State of Tennessee, in fact, is at 7.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| So the board has always been extraordinarily responsible and cautious, conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| in the use or choosing of actual assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| So I appreciate the confidence you've placed in our firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| and we feel very good about the direction that we're taking going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Mr. Chairman, the Investment Committee would like to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| motion that this plan be approved by the committee, by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2665)|
| 0:44:25| Will that be your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2669)|
| 0:44:29| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| The IPS says the investment policies were handed out to all the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| You're approving that as well as the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2686)|
| 0:44:46| Do we need to restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| We can restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Let's go ahead and just restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Ms. Bennett, would you clearly state exactly what we need to make sure we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| It's all three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| All three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| We have three plans where we've changed the investment statement for all three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| So would it be better to do a motion by each plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| The first vote would be for the Closed-to-Fund Benefit Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Vote for approving going to mutual funds as well as the investment policy that's been handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| So is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| And the second is for voting on the mutual funds and the policy investment statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| for the Knox County Retirement System Closed-to-Fund Benefit Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2738)|
| 0:45:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| The second one will be for the Teachers Plan of Knox County to approve changing over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| mutual funds as well as the investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| And the third one will be for the Knox County Uniform Officer's Pension Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| Mutual funds being used as investments going forward as well as the new investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Do we have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2783)|
| 0:46:23| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2784)|
| 0:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2787)|
| 0:46:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Does that conclude all reports from the Investment Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2796)|
| 0:46:36| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| All right, next we'll move on to a report of legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| First on the list is Owens, Wilson, and Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Is it this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2810)|
| 0:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I was like, all right, there's a lot of buttons up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Okay, only a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| First of all, like Kim said, we've done some pretty extensive work on the regroup contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Substantively, it's a good agreement, but clearly they've never dealt with a Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| local governmental entity yet, so a lot of the type of stuff that we usually have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| deal with in those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| And so hopefully that'll all slide through without too much trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| The other thing is that we have prepared a notice of appearance for the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| deck action, and we're meeting with Mr. Burks after this meeting to get those executed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| filed, and we've begun work looking at the complaint, and that's the one we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| So that's all I have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| Chuck Burks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| Nothing in addition to add to what Stephanie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Kenner Montgomery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Nothing to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| That concludes the report of legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Next is a report from our actuary, Bob Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Chairman, I would like to discuss one of the previous items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| In my heart, I know that the four individuals that came up to discuss the request that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| have before the board, the amount of money they're going to have to come up with is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| to be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I have difficulty charging them $500 just to be candid, but to make a calculation, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| think they're probably going to be pretty disappointed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| So I think we'll just do that gratis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I would ask that that not be a precedent, but I would hate to charge them and come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| to be the number that I'm pretty sure it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| So if that's okay with the board, I'd like to proceed in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| I'd like to add a thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Well, Kim, will you notify the individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Yes, I'll give them a notification this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Are they still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2944)|
| 0:49:04| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2946)|
| 0:49:06| Okay, thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| All right, any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2952)|
| 0:49:12| Most of your stuff was given out during investment, so all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| All right, now the most exciting part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Please, we've got a list of all of our bills that we have here in your agenda, and do I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| have a motion to pay our bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2965)|

| 0:49:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Okay, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| I call to order the Finance Committee meeting for January 22, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| To my right is the Vice Chairman, Commissioner Gill, and to my left is the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| from the Knox County Clerk's Office, Kim Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Commissioners, you should have received the minutes by email on January 10 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Are there any corrections or additions to those minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Seeing none, do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Now we have a report from the Knox County Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| As most of you know, several individuals in the Finance Department have gotten the flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| and the stomach virus that's kind of going around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| So in presenting today is Jennifer Bode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| And Jennifer, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Okay, I was just going to go over sales tax with you and Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| I think Chris emailed these out to you a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| And the sales tax, it looks like it's coming in right on track with our projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| Could you pull your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| And the sales tax, it's coming in right in with our projections for the budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| It's actually coming in better than it was last year so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| And that goes across all the general funds, schools, and engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3079)|
| 0:51:27| And then for Hotel Motel, it's actually a little down from last year, but it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| we're not too worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| We think with the next few months, it'll bring back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| because it kind of fluctuates from month to month on what we get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| And that's due to collections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Mm-hmm, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| What questions do you have for the Finance Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| And anything else that you saw on here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| you thought we needed to be aware of other than just the Hotel Motel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Well, we certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3130)|
| 0:52:10| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| How are, and I didn't see it, how are the property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| collections going in regards to last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Where are we at on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| And the property taxes are above last year for cross-age fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| It's about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3146)|
| 0:52:26| Was that above projections or above last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| That's above last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| What about projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| A little short on projection, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Maybe a little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| There's a timing difference between November and December of the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Next, we have the report from the Knox County Schools Finance Director, Gary Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| And in your packet with your agenda, you have the documents that he has submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I think in that document, what you're going to see is a general overview of where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| major sources of revenues for the district stand as of the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| BEP funding, we've received in December 21, what's called a January revision of BEP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3191)|
| 0:53:19| for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| And the state of Tennessee increased the school's funding to $209,420,000, which was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3200)|
| 0:53:29| increase of $860,000 from what they call the final allocation, which occurs in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| of the previous year, or in calendar year 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| This raised the BEP funding to about $2.7 million higher than what we budgeted for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| And that's roughly 1.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Obviously, we do the budget back in April, and then we get our first BEP funding allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3233)|
| 0:54:02| typically the day after the board approves the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| And then that's updated in May, June, and July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| And then in the past couple of years, there's been a January revision to help, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| talk about that just in a minute, to help districts pay for additional medical insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| premiums, because the medical insurance plan for the state is on a calendar year basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| and there's no knowledge as to what, or no good knowledge, as to what those premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| are going to do until roughly November, December of a calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| Local option sales tax, we had the question on that that Jennifer answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Looking at collections that have been received through December, the forecasting model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| we used shows our local option sales tax, our portion of it being right on budget, less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| than a point, well, right at a 1.15% increase or positive variance over what we included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3294)|
| 0:55:06| in the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Of course, local option sales tax is subject to the Christmastime effect, and we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| can't get a true handle on it until February when those December collections are remitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Current property taxes, back to that question, a lot of timing issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| We're showing a slightly favorable variance over what we've budgeted through December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| but that doesn't say anything because of the changes in the federal tax law that went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| effect January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| We don't know how many people rushed in to pay their property taxes early before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| February deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| So until that's known, until February collections come in, we really are not real certain as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| to what's going to happen with property taxes, but I think we can say in general that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| collections appear to be close to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| When we look on the expenditure side, and there are three I'd like to point out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| on the second page, one of them is the medical insurance premiums I just touched upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| The $860,000 in additional BEP funds is just about enough to cover our unfavorable variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| that we're seeing for the periods January through June for the employer portion of medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Overall, medical insurance increased by 6.9% as of January 1, which is very tough for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| because it's a big line item in the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| We did bring to commission and the school board approved as well an additional appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| for some additional startup costs, or pre-opening costs for the two new middle schools, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| some, a couple of, or actually four positions could be hired early to help the principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| in their planning and the students' scheduling for the start of the new school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| And that leaves us about $1.3 million of BEP funds to cover any additional unfavorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| budget variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| The one that stands out right now, which, excuse me, I believe everybody in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| can understand, is with the severe cold weather that we've been having, I have a real concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| as to whether our utility's budget is sufficient or not because many locations heat with natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| gas, others heat with electricity, and you'll see in the document the kinds of percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| that, above average, that those bills run for the months of December through February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| We really won't have a handle on these until we get the January bills in, and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| if the weather continues the way it has been, we'll see February as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| So I'm open to any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| On medical insurance premiums, the 860, what is that, what is that percent, what's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| 6.9 percent, what did it cost for the county on the employer side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3486)|
| 0:58:19| We're anticipating for this entire fiscal 2018 year that our health insurance premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| will be right at $47.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Of that, the projected employee contributions are $16.5 million, leaving us with a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| of around $31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| We budgeted right just above $30 million, so that's where it's leaving us, over $800,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3524)|
| 0:58:44| So that 860 is what you missed on projection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3528)|
| 0:58:48| Projection, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3532)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3535)|
| 0:58:55| I've got, this is probably a pretty simple question, but under the pre-opening costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| for Gibbs and Hardin Valley, you mentioned that the school board authorized $489 of BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| revenue to fund some of the unbudgeted costs, and that left a $1.3 million of BEP funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| to cover any unfavorable budget variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| If you don't mind me asking, just really for clarification, the $1.3 million of BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| funds, are we keeping them there in a contingency fund for other potential line items, or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| they weren't already allocated to this line item to cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| For the purpose of this one area, what's happening with those $1.3 million if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| not used for any other surprises in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| At this point in time, they're just unappropriated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3581)|
| 0:59:41| We know it's going to be that high, but we haven't asked to appropriate any of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| money at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| So it's literally contingency funds, knowing that we're going to have some variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| that are going to hit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| For example, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| And during this cold period, we've also incurred what may be some additional physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| maintenance costs, because I know we had a water main break, we had utility outages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and so those get expensive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Do we always kind of have a certain budget for unanticipated things just to be ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| We're just lucky in this case that BEP came in higher than what we projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3616)|
| 1:00:16| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3617)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| On the very back page, it says for revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| It said out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Is that for sales tax on like Amazon and those type things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Is that what that mounts up to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| That's something we'll discuss at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| It's kind of out of order, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| What other questions do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| I had that same question, actually, when I downloaded the sales tax thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3654)|
| 1:00:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Gary, on the insurance, we have to project that months in advance of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| basically on anticipation of what the state rate's going to be for insurance in the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3670)|
| 1:01:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| And this money that we have received from the state, that is to supplement our portion of the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3672)|
| 1:01:24| That's the state's explanation of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3687)|
| 1:01:27| And it seems like every year we wind up a little short because we don't have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| information in advance as to what the state is going to do with their state policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Is there any way that, do you all ever trim that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| I know health insurance is very hard to trim, but it seems like they've been hitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| six, seven percent a year for the last two, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| They increase every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I think Governor Haslam's message is possibly a week from today where he has a state of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| state message and then releases his budget proposal for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| And if you look deeply into that budget proposal, you'll see a provision for a medical insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| increase or whatever it's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| The past two years it's been an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| We've used that as the basis for our projections that we do in the months of February and March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| to build the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Also, we collect a lot of census data and we look in detail at this $47.5 million that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| we're talking about here for medical insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| So beyond that and beyond maybe some swag estimates of what premiums are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| that's what we're working from when we compile the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Any other questions for Mr. Spencer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3768)|
| 1:02:48| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| I know this is a tough bite for teachers when we look at issues of our health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| I mean, the cost of that is just very difficult to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3781)|
| 1:03:11| And the trend will just continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I mean, we are just, medical insurance is just very hard to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| Well, one of the dilemmas that we face as a district is that we're members of a statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| So no matter how many cost reduction activities we enter into, no matter how many wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| plans we institute, we're still at the mercy of the experience of the statewide plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| So that makes this, just the estimating of it, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| Coming from a business background, if I were in this situation, I'd have my broker in talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| about this, what can we do to get these premiums down, what can we offer our employees as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| benefit but without strapping them on and on down the line, exactly what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| But that's when you're the member of a statewide plan and a small member, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| I mean, even though we're a large district, we're still a small member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| We're in there with all the other big districts, we're in there with UT and on and on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| So it makes it extremely difficult for the school district to do any sort of cost benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Now, in saying that, I will say that the district has pledged to KAEC that the percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| will stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| So even though the premiums are going up, the employer proportion as a percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| that increase is staying constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| Next, we'll have our report from the Knox County Trustee, Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3895)|
| 1:05:10| Afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Let me concur and second what Jennifer said briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| One of our major entities that pays taxes, it's not an actual taxpayer, there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| consolidating entities out there that charge banks and mortgage companies 25 cents a taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3924)|
| 1:05:33| and they consolidate them and it makes our life very easy because we just get one wire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| instead of multiple, multiple checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| In 2016, that money came in pretty early November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| 2017, it came in fairly late December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| The money's here, but it can throw people's timing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| Then Gary alluded to the prepays and I'll touch on that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| That was an interesting saga there the last week of December, but I'll touch on that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I call it the refunds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| That's what was hit everyone's radar screen real hard last summer when it was well over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| a million dollars, a million three or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| It's relatively, I won't say harmless, but it's certainly much smaller numbers since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| I spoke to you last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| We've done, I think, what, 67,000 or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| Yeah, 67,800, so almost 68,000 year to date, about 89,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| There aren't any big ones in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Big ones being something that was, I think the largest is a storage facility on Mid Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| Drive, about $25,000 and that's two years taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| The rest, for the most part, are in the hundreds, so a deli shop, a bank on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4011)|
| 1:07:00| a construction company, another hot dog shop, rental place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Anyway, it's what you would expect in the normal course of people appealing their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| So I'll keep you guys informed as these things progress through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| I have a lady who works on them all the time and, of course, any questions in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| I'll entertain them if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| I have a couple other items I want to put on your radar, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Ed, Chris and I had a discussion the other day about, and this falls, I guess, into these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| OTAs in a certain way because this all stems from reappraisals, and the conversation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| about how utilities, whenever we have these reappraisals, their assessment and rate, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| actually lowers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| I think we're going to collect somewhere around $800,000 less this year in payment in lieu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| of taxes due to the state's reappraisal system and how things are worked out with utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| Could you explain that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Yeah, that was my next item to put on your radar because that is going to be a, by my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| calculations, we're looking at, we build out, or we'll, in the process of building out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| $753,000 less to the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| The utilities are things many of us wouldn't call utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Railroads, cell phone towers, barge companies, trucking companies, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| And it's the appraisal, the appraisal for 2016 came in at $505,321,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4123)|
| 1:08:55| The appraisal for 2017 came in at $488,337,000, about a 3% drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4135)|
| 1:09:06| And so you just run the numbers on that, you drop 3%, and you look back, what, six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4146)|
| 1:09:16| ago, the tax rate was $236,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| You look back a year ago, the tax rate was $232,000, and now it's $212,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| And so you put that in the equation, and it's going to wind up, the county's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| a hit of $750,000 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| As I understand, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| How are their appraisals dropping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| I brought my friend the appraiser here for backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| We're going to pretty much pass that book to the state because the state does those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| We, as far as my knowledge, the county has no input on what Norfolk Southern Railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| pays or is assessed, or Verizon cell phone tower on Sharp Ridge, or any of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| For background, I brought, I didn't bring 12 copies, but I got four or five copies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| They're about 40 pages each, so I didn't want to generate that much paper, but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| got some if people would like to look at the actual utilities and what they're assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| I've got four or five copies, and I'd get everybody one if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| But I don't have, Chris and I have had the conversation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| I don't know if somebody from Nashville actually comes to Knoxville, or they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| the Department of Revenue has a local agent, or a third party, or who, and they drive around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| and look at the railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| In my previous private work with railroads, I dealt with them all over the south, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| six states, and each state did it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| And I know some were actually appraised, but I don't recall ever having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| with Tennessee Department of Revenue saying, you're appraising us too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| It's just sort of a generically done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| And I think, let me throw another equation in there that's sort of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| As our home is assessed at 25%, our business is at 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| These things are at 55, is my understanding, which is, again, another unique wrinkle in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| But I don't have the explanation, other than we're looking at a $750,000 hit to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| Okay, $750,000, that's three quarters of a cent, basically, on the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| If you add to that also the OTAs of, what do you think that averaged, $2 million each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| year, and went back two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| We have about a $4 million total payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| That would be a good estimate, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| So that's two and three quarters of a cent we lost on our property tax, in essence, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Less billed out, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| You don't want to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| I just brought John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| I mean, he and I have discussed this also, and I'm not throwing the buck to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Because Chris and I have talked about it, and it's something, it's an issue I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| know how to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| I think everybody on this commission is well aware this is something out of both of y'all's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| control, and it's really a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Right, right, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| We have absolutely nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Now, some of this comes from lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Now, they do, they have appeals like we have every year, except they do their, they value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| these every year on a yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| And they appeal just like the companies, the big companies, the railroads, the phone companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| the cell phone companies, all of them, they appeal every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| And I do know the state has lost a couple of big cases, and when the federal judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| they usually rule on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| And it's a, all of these are big values, and when they hit, it's a pretty good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4375)|
| 1:13:03| And I don't want to sound like I'm a tax kind of guy here, but two and three quarters percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| that's $2.75,000, $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| I can just think of a lot of places like trash pickup, road paving, that we could use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| And it's not like we're asking for more than we would have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| We're just losing on what we should have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| Well, and that's probably true, but they have, they have also told us that some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| lawsuits are going to be ongoing, because the ones they've lost, now some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| companies that wasn't participants in the law, on this lawsuit, are going to start their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| own lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| So, because they're going to go after the same, these successful ones, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| to go the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Well, and then also, last year in the Tennessee General Assembly, there was a bill introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| to lower the utility tax from 55 percent to 40 percent, but I think it stalled in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| I don't think it went any worse past that, but obviously they could rebring that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Because they feel like they're a public utility, just like Verizon and U.S. Cellular, so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| should have the same, same rate, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| And that more than likely will be a lawsuit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Does the state charge for doing property assessment on these utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| Do they charge us for that or take money out of those assessments to go to the state funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| They don't charge anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| And if I believe correctly, and I'm just making this statement, I don't think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| anything in the state constitution about state property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| I think it's mainly done with sales tax, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| Do they get that from the federal government, to be property taxed at the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| This all comes under the Comptroller's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| One other final item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| That last week of December, if you guys recall the, all the hoopla over the financial journals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4518)|
| 1:15:28| and just general news, for that matter, initially came out and said, if you paid your, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| of the change in the tax code, if you paid your taxes, you could pay the 18s now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| take it on the 17 and all those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And then they said you couldn't, but whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| We had multiple people call, and all the taxpayers I spoke with were actually city taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4547)|
| 1:15:55| but what they were doing, they were looking at the big houses on the boulevard, the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| houses just to the west of Cherokee Country Club, which would pay about $9,000 in city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| taxes and about $8,000 in county taxes, so they're suddenly over the $10,000 threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| So it triggered their wanting to pay those taxes early, and I had one gentleman want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| to pay, ask me if he could pay through 2020, which I would have taken it, but our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| there's not, our system could take one year ahead, so we took a lot of 18 money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| He can pay mine next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| You paid yours, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| We drafted your account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| But bottom line, we took in about $625,000 in prepaid taxes, so we've got some free money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4597)|
| 1:16:47| Yeah, so that's held in escrow then, basically, or so, I mean, not escrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| It's a line item on my sheet here, $626,112 in prepaid tax, so, and of course, we told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4611)|
| 1:17:00| them you were welcome to take your money, but that's between you and your accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| and the IRS, whether it can be used or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Would anybody like these utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I've got four copies, three copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I'll put three up there and take them if you like, and if anybody needs them, we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| you some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4635)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| The next item on the agenda is a discussion item from Commissioner Busler to review the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| FY 2019 budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| One of the things that I would like to talk about is our overview on the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| and the reason why that is is we're going to have a complete change in the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| administration coming up in, you know, next year in 2018, and this administration, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4664)|
| 1:17:54| my opinion, has done a good job about making the budget, keeping it lean, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| I don't know who's going to be in the office, and I don't know if, like, the Chris Caldwells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| or the Perry, of course, are going to be here after that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| You know, that's up to the administration, and I would just think it would be good if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| we could be in on some of the best practices that they're doing now to see how the budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| are put together and how they figure out that these budgets are going forward to keep on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| the track that we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Now, if you don't believe that theirs is good, we just need something to learn how we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| those budgets together, and I would just like to be educated on it so where we could start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| early and see how they're distributing the money or making the budgets for each department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4719)|
| 1:18:48| and see if we can see that in the next administration, whoever that's going to be, and do the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| practices in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And I would like, you know, the people that do numbers here that's on the commission maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| could look at some things like this and say this is how they're doing it, and these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| the best practices, and this is how we should look forward in the future on how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| our budgets in our future for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| To me, I am not a numbers guy, but I do go over these numbers and try to see where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| money is being spent and how it's being spent and how they get to the places we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| with the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And again, I'm not a big businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Some people are business, how to run budgets and things of that sort, and I think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| just be in our best interest to see how this is done so we could best, I guess, look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| future practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And that was my thought about looking at how we could get involved earlier and take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| at our budgets before we get to them, because we have not a long time to look at them, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| we have a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I'm not questioning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| I'm just saying we ought to know how it's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| So that was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| I think the one piece that's missing is Chris Caldwell is obviously not here because he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| I don't want to put words into his mouth, but I know historically in usual budget processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| you've got different departments that are going to work on their budgets internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| and propose them to the finance department, then it's slowly all going to start to, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| a series of meetings, start to build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| That might be, that could go back to Chris, could be to, and if there are any preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| budget meetings, either an invitation to any of us who might want to sit in on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| or that type of piece, because I haven't been in a few budget sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| I'm guessing that there's got to be preliminary workup meetings where different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| have submitted what their requests are, not knowing exactly where our tax revenue is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| to come in, a dream budget, and then they usually are going to submit a budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| they're going to have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| So, but the follow-up on this, if you all could share that with Chris, could be kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| of keeping us in the loop on that in case any of us wanted to sit in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| Well, I know some of us have been to the finance war room, and I think, Ms. Bodie, you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| start at, what, 7 a.m. and go to 7 p.m., so we're welcome any time in between, but Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you, Chairman Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Jennifer, you all have already scheduled your department meetings, have you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| We don't have any scheduled as of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| We will schedule them in March, because the budget is not due back until February 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| The departments have until then to submit their budgets to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| The kickoffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| The kickoff meeting was January 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| February 10th is when everybody, or February 9th is when the departments have to have everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| back to us for us to start looking at them and put the salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| Well, Commissioner Bussler, do you want to bring this as an item before the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| since that would be a voting entity to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Well, I would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Like I said, the numbers that comes out to us in the hundreds of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| and things like this, I have trouble doing my finances, which is on a very small scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| and even balancing my checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| But I would like to see how they do their planning and how they're forecasting and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| other things that I didn't do finance in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| I know there's nine numbers and one zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| But when you get a lot of zeros and a lot of other numbers together, it's kind of overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| Just to see how they get to that point, so we could just kind of take a look at it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| be more informed on how they get to their decisions when it comes to us, for us to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| on that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| I would like to see the people that are interested in that to do that and maybe bring a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| back to us during a workshop or something like that and explain those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| Also, when we do a shortfall, if there is a shortfall coming up, but how many cycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| through, how can we prepare for those shortfalls and what do we need to look for on the trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| and things of that sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you, Mr. Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Commissioner Bussler, I'll tell you what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| I go to lunch a lot with Chris and Ed Schaus, and I've learned a lot just by going to lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| with them once a week since I've been on commission and actually even before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| But those guys are full of knowledge, and if you spend any time around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| some of it's bound to rub off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| The reason why I was doing it is because we do deal with term limits, and these regimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5049)|
| 1:24:19| keep changing, and sometimes we just have to have some oversights of the best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| to make sure we don't fall into some of the ones that we've done in the past that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| got us in very deep debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| And that's all I'm saying is to have that kind of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| And I'm not saying anything's wrong or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| I just think that we need to know a little bit more in-depth studies or take that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| And my questions would be so that they would probably say, Bussler, we don't want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| back here anymore because you have so much you're asking, but just have some discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| about some of those things here between all of us and see things like we do discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| during regular zonings, you know, where we have those types of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| But anyway, that was my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| In your packet, you have actually some additional charts, spreadsheets that we thought it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| kind of be interesting just to see how the state of Tennessee is performing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| And as you can see on two of the reports that are issued by the state, one is for October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| of 2017, and that is the total sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| That's all that they have reported at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| So those numbers would be just for the month of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And then the second page was from July 1st through October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| So you can see an amazing amount that the state is continuing to grow in sales and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| tax just from last year to this year, over $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| And then on the just for one month, and then when you look at the total from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| to this year, almost $80 million in sales and use tax as an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| So our state is doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| And then the last page was an interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| This is on just your local option sales tax that's returned back to each county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| So if you look at Knox County, how we're doing, it's interesting, too, when you look at Shelby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| County and also Davidson County, when you look, the first column obviously is just for October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| and then the next column is from July through October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Some pretty interesting amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Another thing that's come up on the radar screen, Rutherford County now says that due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| population, they have now surpassed Hamilton County as the fourth largest county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| So when you look at the tax revenue, it's still, you know, it's fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| But they think that for sure when the census is done in 2020, that it will actually be ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Any questions on those three reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| We just thought it'd be kind of interesting to know what's going on throughout the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Under other business, I just wanted to give you a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| One of the items that we discussed during our legislative session was the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| fee that's charged on our local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Representative Jason Zachary last week filed House Bill 1532, and Senator Richard Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5265)|
| 1:27:54| filed Senate Bill 1687.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| So we're now off to the races to see if we can get a reduction in our fee that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| charged for our local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| And as you remember, it's the 1.125 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Since some of you are numbers people, I thought this was kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| I have the report for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| Just for the month of November, their administration fee to get their own sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| was $24,100.29, just for the return of their own sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| So there's a lot of people around the state that are starting to gain some momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| So I think that was kind of a good thing that we did that as one of our legislative items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| that can benefit everybody in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| Is there any other items that need to be brought before the Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5337)|

| 1:29:28| 1532.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| It's HB 1532 and SB 1687.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| And actually, I was honored to be the author of that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| So that was kind of a neat thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| I've never had that opportunity before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| So seeing no other items before the Finance Committee, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| My fellow commissioners, can I have your attention, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| We call to order the Insolvency Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5394)|

| 1:30:15| And Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Commissioner Carringer, Commissioner Smith, and Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| Let's take a look at our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| The agenda today is the approval of the minutes from September the 8th, 2016, and September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| the 18th, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| If you see any additions or corrections, if not, I need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Motion by Mr. Commissioner Smith, second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| Number three, we're going to take a look at the sale of property-owned taxes that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| county has pursuant to Resolution R-18-1-801, and we're going to have it listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5459)|
| 1:31:08| Do you have all copies of the actual properties that are listed for the tax sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5468)|
| 1:31:17| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| I think we need to approve the minutes by voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| We had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Did we all approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5484)|
| 1:31:24| We did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Well, I thought we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| All approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| By a light sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5504)|
| 1:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Got it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5506)|
| 1:31:53| One, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| There's another member, Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Yeah, I went back and did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Let's take a look at the property that is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| Does everybody have a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Acquired by Knox County at the tax sale, number 20, dated August 2, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5526)|
| 1:32:18| We're going to, yeah, we're going to recognize the law director so he can give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| an overview of actually what you're going to be voting on and to make sure no one has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| any questions about the procedural aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| The members of the insolvency committee should have the memo from the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| The county's acquired these properties through the tax sale or other means and there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| by law, there are outstanding taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| The purchasing department has recommended that these properties are insolvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| That means they're unable to be sold for the amount of taxes that are outstanding on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| And they're recommending that these properties be sold either at auction or by negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| And essentially what the Tennessee Code authorizes is for the properties to come before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| insolvency committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| And then the insolvency committee can take the recommendation of the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| and then recommend that to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| These properties, if the insolvency recommends, they will go to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| Once the commission authorizes these sales, purchasing will then take the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| arrange the sale, and then they'll bring the properties that have been contracted for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| back before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| So it's really a three-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Commission gets to see these properties twice and the last time they see them, they'll know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| exactly what the properties are being sold for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| And so today is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| We'll take the recommendation of purchasing and recommend that to the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| later this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| And Powell Option is our vendor, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5635)|
| 1:34:03| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Well, we're at number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| Do you need to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| You want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5654)|
| 1:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| So then I need a motion to approve the list of properties for sale pursuant to Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| R18-1-801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Properly motioned by Commissioner Schoolmaker, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Then I need a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5683)|

| 1:36:49| Okie Joe's Sports Bar and Grill, 226 Andrew Johnson Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Okie Joe's Sports Bar and Grill, LLC, owner of District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| For this matter, Mr. Chairman, as you know, was before this board and at the regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| on December 18th and at a special call meeting on December 21st, there was a motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Andrews with regard to continuing for Okie Joe's to come into compliance with various of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5832)|
| 1:37:22| items that were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| And I think this is back, if I am correct, on a report back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| So, if you want to start, I'll just turn that over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| He was here and he can ask for the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5853)|

| 1:37:40| Could you please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Sir, if you would, please give us a progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5864)|

| 1:38:00| 226 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Continue, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Our deck plans have been turned in and are under review for getting the deck up to par with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| And we've not done much, anything else other than wait for our plans to be completed so we can get a permit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5892)|
| 1:38:24| Codes Department, where were you all in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| We have received the submission for the deck permit, have not received any other plans at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| What other plans do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| The fire system, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| The interior permit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| The interior permit plans for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Are, sir, you aware of what you need for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| I'm not exactly sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| I've had plans since we opened, been turned into the office, all the offices that needed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5934)|
| 1:39:05| Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| I have the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| Has he met all the requirements of the Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| There are no problems with the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| No problem with the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5967)|
| 1:39:27| So we still have the fire and codes issues, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| When do you anticipate having everything done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| We should be able to start work tomorrow on the remaining parts of the deck that we need to have fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| Our electrician will be in tomorrow as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| We just got the plans back this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| So we're waiting on all that to turn it in and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Is that what we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5993)|
| 1:39:53| Do you understand what they're saying by the interior plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| I'm not familiar with what I need for those, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=5997)|
| 1:40:05| I spoke with Mr. Krietler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| He's nodding his head, giving him a list of what he needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| I think it was yesterday or the day before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| You know, when this was presented to us in December at the County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| or at the Beer Board meeting, you know, we were told that this establishment was out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| and that they were operating after their CEO had been revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| We come to find out that the CEO hadn't been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| revocation hadn't been delivered to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| And I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| And so what was stated in the previous meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| not what came out in the special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| And so there seems to be a holdup in the codes or fire office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| to where we're communicating with our businesses what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| until like two or three days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| This should have been a meeting that was had directly after those other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| because we had a lot of miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| It makes us look bad and makes us look like we're hard to do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| If we're not providing people with what they need to get their business open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| This thing, you know, yes, they were out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| Yes, their CEO was revoked, but not at the time that the Commission was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| And so we need to make this process more smooth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| because we're holding up a business from opening that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| was established prior to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| So we need to make sure, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| I guess Dwight needs to make sure that this stuff is taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| communicated to the business so they can get open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| because it wasn't handled as smoothly as I would like for it to have been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| So that's kind of my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| We need to get this taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| Yeah, Knox County is not in the business of trying to put people out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| You were out of compliance and we had an obligation for public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| to make sure you weren't operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| But I would kind of like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| what kind of time frame are you looking at right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| We need approximately seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I don't want to hold you up till next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| if you could be back in business within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| You know, what we often do whenever we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| we issue somebody a new license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| if they have not supplied all the information they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| that is needed by either the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| the fire department, codes, or the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| We hold their license, is this not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Until they, until you receive a letter stating that they are in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Once we receive the release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| a written release from the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| then we can write the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Okay, well I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| It's a pre-pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| Commissioner Wright, I'll let you go ahead and speak, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| If you're in the process of seeking a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| I would move that their mere permit be reinstated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| pending the submission of the appropriate paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6187)|
| 1:43:07| That's exactly where I was going, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Okay, so we have a, any, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| We have a proper mo...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Any discussion from codes or fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| I would like to say that following the special session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| we held for this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| we did take a written report up to them the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| and discussed with them everything that they needed to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| We have heard, I have got no plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| there has been no plans submitted until today from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| And until we get the proper plans, we really can't do much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| We've got to have something to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| So they were notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| They were notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Mr. Threak called me and we spoke recently about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| but that is the first phone call I've had since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| their CO was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| I assumed, and I shouldn't have assumed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| but he would call me to let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| what whatever else needed to be done was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| We just got our plans back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| We, honestly, the day after we met here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| I went back and I searched for an engineer to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| He couldn't come in because it's Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| He couldn't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| I've called several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Everybody is really busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| I mean, that was like kind of short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Finally, the engineer came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| He did get our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| We submitted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| We just got them this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| We submitted them just a little bit ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| We're doing everything we can, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| I don't know exactly what it is more that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Too open other than maybe if Travis could come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| and, you know, show me, you know, what it is that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| He did tell me when I spoke to him Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| about the exit signs, the egress paths and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| We were working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| We've got people ready to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I just need to know exactly where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| So I'm not doing it multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| We can't last much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I mean, you know, the business has been closed a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Mr. Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Sir, you made a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| You said you could have all these things ready in seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6335)|
| 1:45:35| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Fire and codes, can they meet that requirement in seven days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| What you're needing from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| They could, but I doubt that they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| And it also depends on what the architect comes back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| You know, the question is, is this building going to be required to be sprinkled or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Until I get, I told Mr. Threat, as soon as he gets plans from his architect to call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6356)|
| 1:46:03| we would set up a meeting and he could come up in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| and I would sit down with him and look at it prior to him even submitting to coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| So if there's any problems, we could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| But until I get something in front of me, I don't have anything to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| I have those plans with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I have those plans with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Why would the building need to be sprinkled now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| whenever you opened this building a year or so ago and it wasn't required then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| Well, I feel like it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| But if the architect puts on there that it is storage or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| then I'm going to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| You're talking about the upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6402)|
| 1:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| You say you feel like it should be in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| What does the law say and the code say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Well, the law says if there's a residential occupancy up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| that it has to be sprinkled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| But if the architect comes back and puts storage on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| then it's not shown as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| It has been used that way in the past and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| We're pretty clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| But, you know, that's where it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| I'm in line with Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I didn't like it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| I don't like it this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| There's still codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| They've still got to come for codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| And if this deck is in the setbacks, I'll be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| If not, they'll have to go before BZA to ask for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| or tear it down and start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| So I don't think it's our department's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| I think it's more of the owners not following back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| following through like they said they would do last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| The motion that Brad made and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| if everything gets done and everybody's signed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| before we have our next meeting to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| because I certainly know what it's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| in trying to get contractors now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| It is booming, which we're all proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| and glad to be a part of in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| It's booming and it is hard to get contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| I mean, everybody, they don't call you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| I mean, they're so busy that I've experienced this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| in my own personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| So if you all can get it done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| and you can get your contractors and all that to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| with their firing codes and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| then I think that's how we ought to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| If possibly, Travis, if you could come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| maybe tomorrow or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| I mean, if you will actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| if you will show me exactly what you want done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| I will make sure that's done in seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| I'm not allowed to do design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| You're going to have to have your architect engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| bring plans up and I have to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Oh, okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Well, I've got those with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| So when you want to meet up, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| I was going to say, if you've got your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| stay after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| and maybe y'all can knock this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Commissioner Kerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Yeah, that's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Okay, we have a motion that's been properly seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| before us to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| Restate that, please, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| The motion, as I hope I made it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| was that the consideration...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6565)|
| 1:49:33| Well, I forgot what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| You said reinstate their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| pending the approval of the obligancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| By a vote of nine to one, the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6589)|
| 1:49:58| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Sorry, Commissioner Brantley, I couldn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6600)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| You know, I had to step out for a bad cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| I just wanted to make sure...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| I'm sure somebody already reiterated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| We're having conversations with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6623)|

| 1:50:32| and that the clarification of what the owner needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| is given to him so that when we do the pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| of the motion we just approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| that there is no question about what he needs to have completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| Well, everything's being recorded for the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6645)|

| 1:50:52| to work out exactly what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| so that they can get back in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6655)|

| 1:51:29| CEO of Waggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Okay, what our procedures are here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| is when there is in fact an offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| or an allegation of offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| we first hear from the officer, which will be Chief May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| He will state what he or she believes to be the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| and then after that, you can either affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| or deny what Chief May says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| and you will have a chance to explain or talk to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| however manner you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| So, Chief May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| On December 7, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| I sent an underage person into Waggles, 9729 Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| and we bought a six-pack of Coors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Have you heard and understood the allegation from Chief May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6739)|
| 1:52:19| Do you admit or deny that allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| We admit it happened, absolutely happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Okay, and now you have any testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| you'd like to give this board, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| The only testimony I have to give to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| is our employee in the store did everything right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| until it come to the end of the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| She read it, read the ID, put it in the register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| and then unfortunately, she typed in the wrong number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| That's no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| We're not, I'm not coming here to get, not here to give excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| I'm here to tell you that number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| we didn't do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| We didn't do the job well and we apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6777)|
| 1:52:57| I will now defer to the commission for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| It's been a while since we've had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| What's the minimums that we went by recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6785)|
| 1:53:14| Commissioner Skinneker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| This is for the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| Is there, have they had problems at this location in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| No, they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| The answer to that question is none of them had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Is this the first violation of Weigel's stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| It's not the first, but it's been a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| since we've had a Weigel's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| This, if I may, this store, this store has been open eight to nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| one was open eight years, the other ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| and has not had violations in either store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| Wolfie, have you gone into these stores several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| and ran your operation and never had issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| Yes, I've been in many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| And there's one thing that I believe it's Senator Massey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| is bringing up in order to get everybody underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| because we have the red strop, which, if that red strop's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| that just seems, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Yes, ma'am, we're very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| We do internal beer stings also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| We have an internal beer sting operation goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| And so, you know, we, no excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| we fail miserably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| Yeah, and we realize things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| and we're just all thankful nothing happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| that no one was injured because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| And also, I am very excited about the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| that Becky Massey is trying to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| Yeah, has it all gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| where the driver's license is going to be turned vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| So hopefully, this will eliminate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| where they won't have to look at a red strop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| But I can see how somebody can key in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Is there anything differently you think you could change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| to keep that mistake, like a scanner or something that could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| because we hear that a lot, that a number gets keyed in wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. McMullin, I've got to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| You've been a very good neighbor out in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| We've enjoyed having your stores out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| and your headquarters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| And you give us very little problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| But every now and then, something slips up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| that you can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| But we do have things that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| because it was done, that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| And, but I just want to say, you are a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| and a good person for our community and for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| But we've got to make a motion of some weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| And I'm not going to make it, because it's not my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| Chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| You want to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| Yeah, we have a minimum thing that, you know, for your fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| And I think it's, what is it, $1,000 and 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| So you have an option of paying a fine of $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| or lose the license for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| And that's basically what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| That's what the commission says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| So is that in the form of a motion, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Daly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7018)|
| 1:56:58| OK, we have a proper motion and a second before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7018)|
| 1:57:08| for a fine of $1,000 or 60 days suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7036)|

| 1:57:22| Sir, you will need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| You can choose whichever one you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| I guess they need to ask, which one do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| We'll do the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7053)|

| 1:58:00| I've already told you you know the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7080)|

| 1:58:30| A person come in the store, they took the ID, punched the ID in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| punched the wrong number in at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7115)|

| 1:58:48| I now turn it over to the commission for its discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| As much as it pains me to do it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| we got to make the motion of a minimum 1,000 or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7137)|

| 1:59:11| you usually, you do such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| We never see you all here and you're so good to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| but we have to be evenly fair to every retailer in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| Sir, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7164)|

| 1:59:27| We work very hard to be a good corporate citizen and we're embarrassed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7167)|

| 1:59:43| but I think it says a lot about your company when the CEO appears before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7183)|
| 1:59:49| We do not see that very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| So that just says, because you could have delegated that to a lot of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| in your organization, but that really speaks volumes for your company and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=7195)|

| 2:17:29| Before we get started, I would like to extend a very thankful thanks to Drew for her help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| in rescheduling these meetings for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| We canceled our work session because of the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| And it was harder than I thought it would be to reschedule these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| I also want to thank the chair of the Finance Committee, the chair of the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| and the chair of the Insolvency Board for their help in working with Drew and I to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8272)|

| 2:18:16| They are here today with their Cub Master, and that is none other than our own Deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8296)|

| 2:18:35| getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| And I'd like to thank the Board of Trustees for their support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| I'd also like to acknowledge Dwight and Engineering Public Works for all the hard work they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| getting us through this snowstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| Those guys, they're working when the rest of us aren't, and they're trying their best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| to make our roadways as safe as possible during these treacherous conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| Dwight, would you like to come down and say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8338)|
| 2:19:06| Thank you, Chairman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Very briefly, what I would like to do is, for the matter of record, I get a lot of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| for good work that other people does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| That's true for Jim Snowden as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| Both of us are fortunate to work with the staff, the quality that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| They're just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| But the real leadership in these winter weather events, and we've actually had two, is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| Brian Hubbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| And Brian's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8369)|
| 2:19:29| If he'd come on down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| I would just want to point out to this commission that when I started eight years ago, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| no liquid brining systems, so we did no pretreatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| And it has been under Brian Hubbs' leadership that the entire program of pretreating roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| in advance of snow events has been initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| And it has been a game changer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| I think all of you have seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| Particularly in this event, it makes a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| We salt more miles of road, both pretreatment and post-snow treatment, than we ever have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| So much of that is due to Brian Hubbs' leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| His management of the route system, his management of the personnel and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| that he's entrusted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| I can't say enough good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| He just raises the bar every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| So I just would ask that this commission recognize the good work that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| I appreciate the credit that comes my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| But it really, that's a confidence that rests with Mr. Hubbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Thank you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8426)|
| 2:20:26| Would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Before Mr. VandeVate leaves the podium, I would also like to say this is not just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| roads, because roads were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| But while the roads were closed, so were the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| The catch-up time in the convenience centers, I've had several comments from the Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| location on Tazeville Pike, that they were out there working the yard, getting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8453)|
| 2:21:00| through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8460)|
| 2:21:00| And they were backing up, but they were getting them through really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| So that also is a kudo for the Public Service Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Dwight, this is very humbling to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| And I think the kind words from my senior director, Mr. VandeVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| And thank all of you for acknowledging us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| But I'm very, just one small, intricate piece of 80 people that make all this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| And they're out there, like you say, day and night, you know, treating and salting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| And I'm very proud of our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| And like I said, I'm just a small part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| And I'm blessed to be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8499)|
| 2:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| And one last item, kind of a little PSA, a public service announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| The flu is running rapid in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| And I would encourage everybody that is sick to seek treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8512)|

| 2:22:05| And I know that staying home from work has a financial impact on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| But I hope that people will also consider the effects that spreading this disease can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| have on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8535)|

| 2:22:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| OK, before we do the devotion, I'd like to recognize Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| This past week, a former commissioner of Knox County and former commissioner of District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| 6 passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| Mr. Jim Harbin on the 17th passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| And not only was he one of the first Knox County commissioners as it newly formed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| 1980 through 1988, he was also a Purple Heart recipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| He received his Purple Heart at T-Bone Hill near Chorwon in North Korea during the Korean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| So I wanted to send condolences to his wife, Faye, his son, James, and Dennis, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| just acknowledge his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| And we'll put something on the agenda for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| Hopefully his family will be able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| So I just want to acknowledge that prior to the devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| Commissioner Brantley, will you please lead us in the devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| Our devotion today comes from Romans 1, 6 verses 16 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| For I'm not ashamed of this good news about Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| It is God's powerful method of bringing us all who believe it to heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| This message was preached first to the Jews alone, but now everyone is invited to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| to God the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| This good news tells us that God makes us ready for heaven, makes us right in God's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| When we put our faith and trust in Christ to save us, this is accomplished from start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| to finish by faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| As the scripture says it, the man who finds life will find it through trusting God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| Romans 1, 16 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8654)|
| 2:24:24| Commissioner Gill, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8666)|
| 2:24:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| Please remove your hat, stand and give proper salute to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8679)|
| 2:24:47| Please be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| Next, we have public forum, and the first name I have is Craig Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| If you would, please come down and state your name and address for the record, and you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| My name is Craig Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| I'm a physician at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Some of you may know about the opiate addiction problem we have, and I'm one of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| who takes care of the pregnant women in that regard, and we're changing the practice for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| the country in that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| I want to thank the commission for giving me the opportunity, as well as my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| and our attorney, the opportunity to bring this forward to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| I'm a homeowner in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| I passed out this little pamphlet, and over the past few years have kind of worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| this strip of county land that's behind our properties between TVA and us, and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8736)|
| 2:25:44| in talking to the county, we've told to talk to TVA, and TVA tells us to talk to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| and to make a long story short, went to an attorney, Mr. Seymour, who got us the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8749)|
| 2:25:56| and went through this, and so let me just kind of go through this in summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| First page, this little strip of land was deeded to the county in 1952 by TVA for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8762)|
| 2:26:08| benefit of the public, and it was to be maintained by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| And it was to be maintained by the county for public use, but over time, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| a map at the very back of it, it shows that this piece of strip of land that's anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| from 10 to 20 feet wide has become blocked by public use because of the private properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8783)|
| 2:26:31| and the pumping station off North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| Could I ask a question, doctor, as we're moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| What's an address that we can reference online or something in regards to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| What's the side street there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| My 2045 Christus Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8805)|
| 2:26:45| It's Stony Point Farms, but 2045, that's where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| So it's pretty much the isolated because it's got private property on two sides and a utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| pumping station on the third side, so the only access to this is from the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| Somebody would have to park next to the rocks and climb up to get to this little strip of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| So it essentially has become not usable by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| It has, theoretically, has to be maintained by the county, so it's a theoretical expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| It's a liability in this little area if someone was to be injured, plus as a physician and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| dealing with mosquitoes, it's an area that can harbor mosquitoes, which can carry West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| Nile virus and Zika, which may get up here eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| So in going through this deed, and I read every page of it, nothing in here, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| no language in here that says that the county can't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| The deed discusses that successors, if the county wanted to get rid of it, that the successors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8860)|
| 2:27:47| would have to follow the same language as the deed, that if TVA doesn't like what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| going on, they have the right to come in and take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| And so there really is no reason for Knox County to maintain this little 10 to 20 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| strip of land, because it's useless to the public, it theoretically costs money, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| it's a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| So I would propose, if possible, if this body would allow our attorney to meet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| county attorneys to work on a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| And so if you flip to the last page, it really kind of shows where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| The green square is the pumping station off of North Shore that blocks access that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| and then the other areas are the private properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| And so I know that there's a lot involved regarding the county and what the county can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| do and TVA and what TVA can do, but instead of continually talking to people and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| different information, I wanted to bring it to the commission so that we might be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| to get the attorneys to talk about it and see if there's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| And that's really pretty much what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| Any questions I can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8937)|
| 2:28:57| We'll have the attorneys look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| If I'm trying to remember some of the conversation, but the Director of Parks and Recreation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Is that under your jurisdiction at this current time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| Because I thought at one point, one of the neighborhoods across from North Shore wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| to have access for a walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| So as he makes his way down front here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8960)|
| 2:29:25| That's blocked now, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8965)|
| 2:29:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Doug Battelle, Director of Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| Yeah, Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Several years ago, we did a memorial to the Animal Farragut birthplace at Animal Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| Park, and there was discussion at that time about access around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| Of course, that was also very much entangled in the memorial put there about 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| ago, marking that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| Since then, as I understand it, that memorial has been given to the Town of Farragut for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| inclusion in the Animal Farragut Museums there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| But that property is still under your jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9006)|
| 2:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| Can I ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| Doug, is that the Frisbee golf right across the waterway there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| OK, just getting my bearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| It's across from Admiral Park, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| We'll have the lawyers look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| Mr. Seymour, you start to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| I think Commissioner Schoonmaker referenced the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| That was Lylan Fitzgerald's property at that time, and the DAR Memorial to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| Admiral Farragut was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| It's right next to the town hall at Farragut now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| So I think that discussion has ceased at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| TVA can only surplus property for certain purposes under the TVA Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9055)|
| 2:31:03| Probably the best solution, if David or Bud and I come up with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9063)|
| 2:31:11| If there was sentiment not to hang on to this property, to deliver it back to TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9071)|
| 2:31:17| and let TVA put out an RFP for it and handle it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| That's just one thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| Next, we have Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| And you have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| My purpose here tonight is to read into the record the email that I sent to you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| on January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| Let it be noted that at this time, I haven't heard any response from you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| I have had one response from Matt Myers and a response from two of the city council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9122)|
| 2:32:14| Without further ado, with this email, I am requesting the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| and the Knoxville City Council use whatever methods, powers that they have at their disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9140)|
| 2:32:28| to extract from Helen Ross McNabb the specific procedures that will be used to ensure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| safety of the citizens, employees, peace officers, and offenders that may be impacted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9154)|
| 2:32:43| opening of the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center onto Wine Road in Knoxville, and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9163)|
| 2:32:51| communicate that information immediately and unilaterally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| It is with great disappointment that I find myself having to correspond with these bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| to attempt to receive the cooperation and communication that should be afforded citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| who have respectfully requested information regarding a government-funded operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9188)|
| 2:33:16| Specific questions were posed to the commission in October 2017, along with an appeal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9196)|
| 2:33:26| an offer to work with those involved in oversight for the BHUCC to ensure the success of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9206)|
| 2:33:34| experimental approach to jail diversion for non-violent offenders with mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9214)|
| 2:33:43| Matt Myers in Knox County Purchasing was identified by the commission as the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| to contact to get the questions answered. At Mr. Myers' request, an electronic version of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9228)|
| 2:33:55| the questions was forwarded to him. The responses to the questions received in December 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9235)|
| 2:34:03| are attached. It is obvious by these responses that there is no intent to develop a transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9243)|
| 2:34:11| open, ongoing relationship with those whose neighborhood is directly impacted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9251)|
| 2:34:18| placement of this facility in their midst. Since the council and the commission are directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| responsible for the existence of this facility by upholding the dubious definition of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| as a hospital, enabling zoning approval, and by approving the considerable operational and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| building remodeling funding, it is only reasonable to expect that these bodies be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9280)|
| 2:34:48| ensuring that this facility does not threaten the safety of those citizens impacted both directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| and indirectly by the existence of this facility. And since the commission and the council have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9295)|
| 2:35:03| authority to do so, I respectfully request that these bodies take whatever action necessary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9303)|
| 2:35:11| set up whatever process is necessary to ensure that safety measures covering all contingencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| are in place and are communicated to the public, the public welfare demanding it. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9318)|
| 2:35:27| your consideration. I have only one thing to add. You folks have started traveling down a road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9327)|
| 2:35:35| within six weeks, according to a recent news report, will become a reality. I'm not sure you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9335)|
| 2:35:43| completely what your liability and responsibilities are. This is an entirely different undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9343)|
| 2:35:51| unless there's something I'm not aware of. You haven't done anything like this before. This is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| experiment, and I would pray that you would look into whatever options you have for becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9356)|
| 2:36:05| intimately involved in knowing what's going on. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9365)|
| 2:36:14| Next, we have David Erling. Sir, if you would also give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| Yes, sir. My name is David Erling. I live at 5721 Aloha Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9380)|
| 2:36:31| And to the commission this evening, I'd like to address to you also about the Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| Center. I'm just curious because looking around, we put this as a hospital. It was zoned as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9396)|
| 2:36:45| hospital. And with that zoning, we also fall under the Code of Federal Regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| And there are several regulations that deal in an emergency action plan, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| quite extensive. And that falls under 485.920. Also, for the training of the personnel working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9418)|
| 2:37:08| there, that falls under 485.900. And we've not gotten a lot of information on this place. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9428)|
| 2:37:20| is there going to be any type of restraints? Are they going to have these people secluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| in separate rooms? All that falls under the Federal Codes of Regulations, and at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| time with an emergency action plan, literally under federal law, if we have a natural disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| they're still supposed to provide service because it is considered and zoned a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| They are supposed to provide service to regular people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| Have we even looked at that? Do we know what road we're taking with this? I do not think the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9471)|
| 2:38:00| or the county has truly looked into all the aspects. Once you zone this a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9480)|
| 2:38:08| what all falls under that? That's all I have this evening. I thank you. Y'all have a wonderful night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9488)|
| 2:38:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| Next, we have Andre Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9500)|
| 2:38:30| Sir, if you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| Yes, my name is Andre Canty, and my address is 4268 Holston Drive, Apartment 20, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9515)|
| 2:38:49| Five minutes. All right. I just wanted to say I became aware of the, and he just left, about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9529)|
| 2:38:57| Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson proclamation on January 20th. I just became aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9537)|
| 2:39:04| and I've pretty much come to condemn it, and this is why. It's under the notion that the Confederacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| and men like Jackson and Lee led Tennesseans, brave Tennessee soldiers, for a cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9553)|
| 2:39:20| Well, that cause had everything to do against me and black people, and I want to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9560)|
| 2:39:30| a speech from the Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stevens, who said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| our government is found upon exactly the opposite idea. Its foundations are laid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| This, our new government, is the first in the history of the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9599)|
| 2:40:06| This is not a group that should be honored for a day, and I know this is not a collective decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| by the commission, and I know that, but I just wanted to say that to honor these men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| and put the county on it is a set of bad precedent. It's saying that people of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| don't matter. I'm an East Tennessean for generations. My family's from Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9627)|
| 2:40:35| and Kingsport. They migrated here. I've been born and raised here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9635)|
| 2:40:41| I'm a Southerner. I'm an Appalachian. So, therefore, my opinions and my values should matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9641)|
| 2:40:49| and historically speaking, East Tennessee was pro-union. So, it's against history to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9649)|
| 2:40:56| the Confederacy, and that history is right outside of our doors, right by the old courthouse that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9656)|
| 2:41:03| states that East Tennessee was not with the Confederacy. They were pro-union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9663)|
| 2:41:11| So, again, it's not about erasing history. It's condemning it, and that history belongs in museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9671)|
| 2:41:19| We don't honor Nazis, as we shouldn't. We don't honor terrorists, as we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9679)|
| 2:41:27| These men should not be honored, and a couple of years from now, on January 20th, will coincide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9687)|
| 2:41:35| with MLK Day. That is a great disgrace. So, not only do I condemn it, I encourage all elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9695)|
| 2:41:42| officials to condemn this, too, and I don't know the rules, the proclamation, and I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| the state's involved. I'll keep hearing stuff about the state, but I need our leaders to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| condemn this for all NASCountians, for all Tennesseans like me, because we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9714)|
| 2:42:01| white supremacists to be galvanized by this honoring. People died in South Carolina on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9721)|
| 2:42:09| Confederate flag. In Charlottesville, people were killed by white supremacists because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9729)|
| 2:42:18| protested the taking down of Robert E. Lee. This is a cycle of violence that must stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9738)|
| 2:42:27| and to stop it, we must condemn it. Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9747)|
| 2:42:44| Okay, we have no honorary resolutions. Next item on the agenda is the approval of the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9764)|
| 2:42:51| minutes. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just needed to do a housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9771)|
| 2:42:59| I guess, effort here on our minutes. During last month's meeting in the zoning portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9779)|
| 2:43:07| I made a motion to approve a property in my district, and I specified with two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9787)|
| 2:43:15| and I did say according to the MPC documents, and what I was referring to at the time was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9795)|
| 2:43:23| whole file where the applicant actually said two lots. So the minutes as you have them before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9803)|
| 2:43:32| will say request of S2 Corporation for rezoning from A Agricultural to RA Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9812)|
| 2:43:40| with one condition, and that one condition is development limited to two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9820)|
| 2:43:51| Commissioner Andrews. Yeah, Dwight, can you come down before I affirm this? Also in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9831)|
| 2:44:00| minutes in dealing with 7J, 17RZ, and I believe the sector plan, the wording in the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9840)|

| 2:44:43| Have you spoken to Arthur about that? I want to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| getting what we exactly. No, sir, we did feel it was important to put some time parameters on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9887)|
| 2:44:54| but I've not talked to Mr. Seymour since the last discussion. Be glad to do so if he's still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| but he's right behind you. I know we talked about, I did say four years. I think the wording question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9898)|
| 2:45:04| is to be dedicated to Knox County within four years, but I think he's wanting to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9904)|
| 2:45:11| at Knox County's request within four years. Is that correct, Arthur? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9911)|
| 2:45:18| We just want to, the county has to request it, is that? Yes, because there was quite a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| discussion about the road, and I assume this dedication will be needed, and the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9925)|
| 2:45:34| was, we agreed that it would be 30 feet on either the east or the west side, and I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9934)|
| 2:45:41| that we put some reasonable time on it if Knox County would request the dedication within four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9941)|
| 2:45:48| years, which I'm sure they will because they're working on the road plans now, but just to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| that, and that that was a condition of the zoning, and that way that gives Knox County enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9953)|
| 2:46:01| power, because if they ask for the dedication, and whoever owns the property doesn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9961)|
| 2:46:08| they can't develop the property at that point. Is that, so the legislative intent of the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| should read they're giving the 30-foot route of way on either the east side or the west side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9975)|

| 2:46:39| depending on their point. Is that agreeable, Dwight, is that comfortable? Yes, sir, I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=9999)|
