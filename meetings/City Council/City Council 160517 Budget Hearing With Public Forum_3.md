| 4:18:21| unserved sidewalk needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| Yes we need some code changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| we do have some leverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| to get some leverage to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| developers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15509)|
| 4:18:33| Greenfield areas to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| in sidewalks or redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| of existing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| to put in sidewalk but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| it does need some strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15523)|
| 4:18:47| there is some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| minimum subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15531)|
| 4:18:53| regulation changes but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15533)|
| 4:18:55| the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15535)|
| 4:18:57| for a separate ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15537)|
| 4:18:59| for the city to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| because the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15543)|
| 4:19:05| probably more willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| go there than the county so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| and I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| we don't have as much green space as the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15553)|
| 4:19:15| has so more likely there will be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| subdivisions out there but we will still have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| in the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15559)|
| 4:19:21| and the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15561)|
| 4:19:23| there are frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| redevelopment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| to get at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| a little piece of sidewalk put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15569)|
| 4:19:31| we try our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| to get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15573)|
| 4:19:35| to happen so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| know what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| if we counted all those little segments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15579)|
| 4:19:41| any idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| how far we get in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15583)|
| 4:19:49| It depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15589)|
| 4:19:51| the frontage of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| and all that sort of thing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15593)|
| 4:19:55| we do go with every opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| we can when it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15597)|
| 4:19:59| Is there a big backlog of stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15599)|
| 4:20:01| fixes we have to make under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| some water quality law or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| We have more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| backlog of fixes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| under just aging infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15609)|
| 4:20:11| We heard about one this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15611)|
| 4:20:13| built in 1880| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| along the railroad tracks on Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| or something that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| pretty ancient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| I think stormwater infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| we have lots of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| that has maintenance needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15625)|
| 4:20:27| stormwater to buildings that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15627)|
| 4:20:29| own so I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15629)|
| 4:20:31| there's always going to be a continuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15631)|
| 4:20:33| backlog of infrastructure needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15633)|
| 4:20:35| stormwater is one part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15635)|
| 4:20:37| street resurfacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15637)|
| 4:20:39| sidewalks those all guardrails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15639)|
| 4:20:41| we now have a guardrail program that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| we hope to have funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| Are we still under that federal order gun about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15645)|
| 4:20:47| the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| control? There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15649)|
| 4:20:51| Federal Clean Water Act lawsuit years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| Mr. Howley if you'd like to talk specifically about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15653)|
| 4:20:55| that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| Is that still ongoing in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15657)|
| 4:20:59| things we've been mandated to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15659)|
| 4:21:01| That's continuous it never ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15661)|
| 4:21:03| That's a continuous program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| That will never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| end there's a continuous ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| program for that permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15669)|
| 4:21:11| We are regulated by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15671)|
| 4:21:13| for water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15673)|
| 4:21:15| discharges to the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15675)|
| 4:21:17| Marshall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15677)|
| 4:21:19| Thank you I had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15679)|
| 4:21:21| earlier it was mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15681)|
| 4:21:23| the engineering department was doing a CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15683)|
| 4:21:25| transit station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15685)|
| 4:21:27| is there other CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| infrastructure that's under the engineering department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15689)|
| 4:21:31| We're doing it in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15691)|
| 4:21:33| of CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15693)|
| 4:21:35| It's their need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15695)|
| 4:21:37| their funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| we do it for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15699)|
| 4:21:41| So that and bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15701)|
| 4:21:43| bus shelters that would be in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15703)|
| 4:21:45| budget? Yes and honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15705)|
| 4:21:47| that is a direct result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15707)|
| 4:21:49| we all agreed to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15709)|
| 4:21:51| transit in as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| management function when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15713)|
| 4:21:55| Don Dissler was hired by the city versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15715)|
| 4:21:57| another outside contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15717)|
| 4:21:59| and what that really has done is caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15719)|
| 4:22:01| all of us to really pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| to transit and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| make sure engineering and transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15725)|
| 4:22:07| are working very closely together also with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15727)|
| 4:22:09| redevelopment just allows for us all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15729)|
| 4:22:11| collaborate more so if we get in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15731)|
| 4:22:13| and there's an issue that we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15733)|
| 4:22:15| then we can make sure that all the players are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| at the table and can make the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15737)|
| 4:22:19| project out of whatever the need is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15739)|
| 4:22:21| When you hear engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| they're often times managing the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| Tom has a team of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15745)|
| 4:22:27| and really Tom, Jeff and Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15747)|
| 4:22:29| all have individuals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15749)|
| 4:22:31| as engineers they've got a project management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| skill set and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15753)|
| 4:22:35| often times especially with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| with projects that perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15757)|
| 4:22:39| CAT is doing they're going to manage that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15759)|
| 4:22:41| from soup to nuts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15761)|
| 4:22:43| get it completed versus outsourcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| or contracting out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| Bill were you going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15769)|
| 4:22:51| Thank you Mr. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| I was just going to add that redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| occurs we are rebuilding a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15775)|
| 4:22:57| of the core city infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15777)|
| 4:22:59| some of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15779)|
| 4:23:01| were so badly done that you couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15781)|
| 4:23:03| even tell one should be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15783)|
| 4:23:05| like along Central and State and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| forth around Marble Alley and if we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| down now the new Jackson sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15789)|
| 4:23:11| just got put in I hope people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| have noticed down where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15793)|
| 4:23:15| the old McClellan warehouses were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15795)|
| 4:23:17| we're proceeding very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15797)|
| 4:23:19| along those corridors because as projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15799)|
| 4:23:21| come the sidewalk replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| is part and parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15803)|
| 4:23:25| of that I think as everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| realizes once you're into the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15807)|
| 4:23:29| areas off the main corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15809)|
| 4:23:31| it gets a little more challenging from a funding perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| because you don't have that rebuilding activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15813)|
| 4:23:35| that's fueling the building of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| but really our sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| infrastructure looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15819)|
| 4:23:41| core areas improved markedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| and it's noticeably better than it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15825)|
| 4:23:47| Jim thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15827)|
| 4:23:49| One other thing is we wanted to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15829)|
| 4:23:51| an update on the 700 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15831)|
| 4:23:53| from Jim someone asked that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| I asked that earlier I guess where we were in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| finishing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| and there were two pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15839)|
| 4:24:01| one was the road work and then there's intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| issues that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| Yeah that project includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| not only the 700 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| but those brick medallions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| We've got that under the contract now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15851)|
| 4:24:13| if you've been down there lately we've got the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| side of the roadway poured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15855)|
| 4:24:17| Are they going to be removed the medallions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| The medallions have not been removed yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15859)|
| 4:24:21| Will they be? They will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15861)|
| 4:24:23| They don't seem very stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15863)|
| 4:24:25| over time. Yeah the intent is to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| the 700 block done then the medallions will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| the last part of that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15869)|
| 4:24:31| Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15871)|
| 4:24:33| the estimated completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15873)|
| 4:24:35| of that is around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| the first of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15877)|
| 4:24:39| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| Jim I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| Yes I did. Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| I guess it's really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| talking about your team. Jeff Branham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| has been real good about responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| to citizens concerns about speeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15893)|
| 4:24:55| and stuff and taking looks at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15895)|
| 4:24:57| and when you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15897)|
| 4:24:59| to this roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15899)|
| 4:25:01| infrastructure you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15901)|
| 4:25:03| rumble strip circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15903)|
| 4:25:05| things there's great costs and great delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| it may be that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15907)|
| 4:25:09| make better use of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| they have been doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| I think we all need reminders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15913)|
| 4:25:15| it's sad to say but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15915)|
| 4:25:17| all of us don't drive 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| miles per hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| in a residential zone and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| and just some of those signs they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15923)|
| 4:25:25| with the bicycles and the play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| activity and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15927)|
| 4:25:29| that really helps I think just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15929)|
| 4:25:31| give us a dope slap to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| be mindful of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| and appreciate what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15935)|
| 4:25:37| and maybe we can do more of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15937)|
| 4:25:39| less expensively than some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| heavy infrastructure things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15941)|
| 4:25:43| That's certainly our preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15943)|
| 4:25:45| and our first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15945)|
| 4:25:47| response is to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| whether things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| marked appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15953)|
| 4:25:55| marked and signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15955)|
| 4:25:57| to get people's attention and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15957)|
| 4:25:59| encourage them to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| I mean you jump in your car and you've got to get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15961)|
| 4:26:03| there to there and maybe you started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15963)|
| 4:26:05| late or whatever and you don't pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15965)|
| 4:26:07| I think that helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15967)|
| 4:26:09| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15969)|
| 4:26:13| So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15973)|
| 4:26:15| Fleet Next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15975)|
| 4:26:17| I'm going to do a quick introduction and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| Kerry and Mr. Johnson to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| Jeff's going to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15981)|
| 4:26:23| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15983)|
| 4:26:25| Mr. Shields actually had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15985)|
| 4:26:27| vacation plan so he's at the beach right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15987)|
| 4:26:29| enjoying the sun and the sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15989)|
| 4:26:31| So we have Kerry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15991)|
| 4:26:33| I think many of you know Kerry, she's been here nine years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15993)|
| 4:26:35| She's really kind of the nerve of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15995)|
| 4:26:37| fleet operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15997)|
| 4:26:39| handles lots of customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| outreach, bid specifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16001)|
| 4:26:43| manages the impound facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| and then Jeff has been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16005)|
| 4:26:47| he's just right out of year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16007)|
| 4:26:49| he's actually really the number two from an operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16009)|
| 4:26:51| perspective for the light and heavy shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16011)|
| 4:26:53| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16013)|
| 4:26:55| Fleet has right at 54 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16017)|
| 4:26:59| impound budget is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16019)|
| 4:27:01| $858,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16021)|
| 4:27:03| and I've got some notes here, that's down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| about $44,000 from the year before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| Overall fleet services budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| is $7.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16029)|
| 4:27:11| It's down about a quarter of a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16031)|
| 4:27:13| from the current fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16033)|
| 4:27:15| and I think really we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| opening this up for questions, Jim York may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| tackle some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16039)|
| 4:27:21| as he's very familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16041)|
| 4:27:23| the budget for fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16043)|
| 4:27:25| because it's very tied to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| So we'll open it up for questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16047)|
| 4:27:29| Page 24 council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16049)|

| 4:27:41| We'll go to Mr. Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16061)|

| 4:27:47| Mr. Walsh will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16067)|
| 4:27:49| come forward and do a very brief introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16069)|
| 4:27:51| and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| 7 and 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| As they're coming down, just one thing to notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| I think you're going to see a lot of new faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16077)|
| 4:27:59| We've had several leadership team retirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16079)|
| 4:28:01| throughout Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| Pretty much the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16083)|
| 4:28:05| chiefs are relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16085)|
| 4:28:07| new in their positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16087)|
| 4:28:09| I think Joe has a relatively new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16089)|
| 4:28:11| team here behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16091)|
| 4:28:13| and you're going to see that throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| Public Works that we've really got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| a lot of new and young individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16097)|
| 4:28:19| involved, so Joe go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16099)|

| 4:28:27| our management team for Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| because they are fairly new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| We've got 6 people that basically help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16111)|
| 4:28:33| manage the Parks and Recreation department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| 4 of them have all been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16115)|

| 4:31:31| on doing some smaller in-house Greenway projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16291)|

| 4:32:29| This trail was opened this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16349)|

| 4:32:33| in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16353)|

| 4:32:37| that will be starting up in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16357)|
| 4:32:39| Appalachian Mountain Bike Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| will be helping us manage and maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16361)|

| 4:32:45| throughout the city, not just urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| but other parts of town as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| as we build those and those are growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| And lastly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| I want to compliment Aaron Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| Aaron headed up an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| back in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| we kicked off our first online registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| at the Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16381)|
| 4:33:03| We now take registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16383)|
| 4:33:05| for programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16385)|
| 4:33:07| for picnic shelter reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| for recreation center reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16389)|
| 4:33:11| Up until last November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16391)|
| 4:33:13| it was very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16393)|
| 4:33:15| for the public to really come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16395)|
| 4:33:17| They had to write a check or hand deliver it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16397)|
| 4:33:19| So now we're able to do online registrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| It's a very easy process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| Our number of registrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16403)|
| 4:33:25| have increased dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16405)|
| 4:33:27| because of these efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16407)|
| 4:33:29| and this recent online registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16409)|
| 4:33:31| So with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16411)|
| 4:33:33| I'm open to any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16413)|

| 4:33:47| We are getting moved in and we're enjoying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16427)|
| 4:33:49| being at Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16429)|
| 4:33:51| We hope to have an open house here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16431)|
| 4:33:53| in the next couple of months as we get things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16433)|
| 4:33:55| fine-tuned. It's been great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16435)|
| 4:33:57| for the department as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16437)|
| 4:33:59| We've been in two different buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16439)|
| 4:34:01| several miles apart up until three weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16441)|
| 4:34:03| and now we're able to work together more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16443)|
| 4:34:05| being right there in the same building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16445)|
| 4:34:07| And where are you on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16447)|
| 4:34:09| prioritizing of the greenways as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| connection that was going to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16451)|
| 4:34:13| I think Lori| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16453)|
| 4:34:15| Do we have a date yet, Seth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16455)|
| 4:34:17| For the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16457)|
| 4:34:19| feasibility assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16459)|
| 4:34:23| Within the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16463)|
| 4:34:25| We're hoping to have a public meeting sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16465)|
| 4:34:27| June or July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16467)|
| 4:34:29| We'll ask the public to come down and view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16469)|
| 4:34:31| what's been put together and comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16471)|
| 4:34:33| That program and plan has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16473)|
| 4:34:35| in the works for almost three years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16475)|
| 4:34:37| but we're pretty excited about wrapping that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16477)|
| 4:34:39| Is there any funding that's being proposed for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16479)|
| 4:34:41| Well I know we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16481)|
| 4:34:43| Mayor O'Hara has offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16483)|
| 4:34:45| we have a million dollars that was funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16485)|
| 4:34:47| the previous two years and we have a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| in the current operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16489)|
| 4:34:51| capital budget that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16491)|
| 4:34:53| before council now. So if that's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16493)|
| 4:34:55| then we'll have right around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16495)|
| 4:34:57| $3 billion to start the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16497)|
| 4:34:59| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16501)|
| 4:35:03| Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16503)|
| 4:35:05| give me a little update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16505)|
| 4:35:07| on Augusta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| Augusta? Well I know the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16509)|
| 4:35:11| we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16511)|
| 4:35:13| Kind of give just a real quick overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16513)|
| 4:35:15| so they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16515)|
| 4:35:17| Sure. If you're not familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16517)|
| 4:35:19| Fort Dickerson, there's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16519)|
| 4:35:21| two parts to Fort Dickerson. There's the part that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16521)|
| 4:35:23| off of Chapman Highway that focuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16523)|
| 4:35:25| more on the Civil War fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16525)|
| 4:35:27| and then the lower part of Fort Dickerson is where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16527)|
| 4:35:29| old quarry is which is a very popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16529)|
| 4:35:31| destination for a lot of younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16531)|
| 4:35:33| especially who like to take advantage of the quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16533)|
| 4:35:35| as a swimming hole in the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16535)|
| 4:35:37| but in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16537)|
| 4:35:39| we've had some issues about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16539)|
| 4:35:41| to that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16541)|
| 4:35:43| from Augusta Avenue which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16543)|
| 4:35:45| on the lower end of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16545)|
| 4:35:47| but I know we've recently council approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16547)|
| 4:35:49| a resolution to approve an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16549)|
| 4:35:51| with Norfolk Southern to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16551)|
| 4:35:53| an easement along the railroad to allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16553)|
| 4:35:55| to build a driveway into our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16555)|
| 4:35:57| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16557)|
| 4:35:59| we're also, right now we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16559)|
| 4:36:01| in the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16561)|
| 4:36:03| trying to staff the quarry area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16563)|
| 4:36:05| there was a couple of fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16565)|
| 4:36:07| in the last few years, people jumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16567)|
| 4:36:09| off the cliffs there at Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16569)|
| 4:36:11| Dickerson so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16571)|
| 4:36:13| last year KPD was good enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16573)|
| 4:36:15| work with us to try and have some officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16575)|
| 4:36:17| on site to help regulate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16577)|
| 4:36:19| we've posted some signs and we've blockaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| some of those more dangerous areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| at the fort and we're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16583)|
| 4:36:25| on having a Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16585)|
| 4:36:27| employee or two on site this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16587)|
| 4:36:29| summer to help manage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16589)|
| 4:36:31| as people come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16591)|
| 4:36:33| to utilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16595)|
| 4:36:37| Mr. Pavlis, there's also one additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16597)|
| 4:36:39| piece of property that our real estate team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16599)|
| 4:36:41| is working on negotiations with right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16601)|
| 4:36:43| now that would allow full access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16603)|
| 4:36:45| off Augusta and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16605)|
| 4:36:47| move forward with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16607)|
| 4:36:49| we'll need a design professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16609)|
| 4:36:51| the goal is to improve the access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16611)|
| 4:36:53| back to the swimming area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16613)|
| 4:36:55| improve the parking area and there's funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16615)|
| 4:36:57| in Parks and Rec's budget to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16617)|
| 4:36:59| obviously that won't happen for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16619)|
| 4:37:01| this summer, this summer is to make sure that road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16621)|
| 4:37:03| open and clear to make sure that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| got a visible presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| not lifeguards but a visible presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16627)|
| 4:37:09| of Parks and Rec staff at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16629)|

| 4:37:39| the summer interns, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16659)|

| 4:37:45| of having those summer interns, we put them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16665)|
| 4:37:47| work and keep them pretty busy. How many will you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16667)|
| 4:37:49| have this year, do you know? I think six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16669)|
| 4:37:53| I think the number hasn't been finalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16673)|
| 4:37:55| but I think usually we have six to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16675)|
| 4:37:57| summer interns. I should have asked earlier but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16677)|
| 4:37:59| didn't. What are they paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16679)|
| 4:38:01| now? I think they're paid minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16681)|
| 4:38:03| wage. The minimum. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16683)|

| 4:38:19| and with Girdow to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16699)|
| 4:38:21| plan that and I think they actually had a meeting yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16703)|

| 4:38:31| mostly initiated, this effort is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16711)|

| 4:38:47| I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16727)|
| 4:38:49| on the greenways, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16729)|
| 4:38:51| spent some serious time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16731)|
| 4:38:53| on studying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16733)|
| 4:38:55| You talked about what's in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| both carryover and the new million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16737)|
| 4:38:59| dollars in the proposed capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16739)|
| 4:39:01| Is there any mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16741)|
| 4:39:03| to be had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16743)|
| 4:39:05| sort of an in-house dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16745)|
| 4:39:07| greenway building team that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16747)|
| 4:39:09| actually does the work? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16749)|
| 4:39:11| public service has heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16751)|
| 4:39:13| They've done segments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16753)|
| 4:39:15| and pieces from time to time. I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| know if there's an economy of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| if you have a group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16759)|
| 4:39:21| sort of does nothing but that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16761)|
| 4:39:23| You can engineer these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| things to the nth degree or you can get someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16765)|
| 4:39:27| over there and look at the hill and see where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16767)|
| 4:39:29| water's going and make the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16769)|
| 4:39:31| Is there some opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16771)|
| 4:39:33| to get some cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16773)|
| 4:39:35| in quick building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16775)|
| 4:39:37| There is. In fact, we've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16777)|
| 4:39:39| with public service. We've got, I think, six individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16779)|
| 4:39:41| set aside from public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16781)|
| 4:39:43| who are going to be a dedicated greenways crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16783)|
| 4:39:45| I think right now we're waiting for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16785)|
| 4:39:47| specialized equipment to be delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16787)|
| 4:39:49| and we should be getting on that this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16789)|
| 4:39:51| Obviously, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16791)|
| 4:39:53| won't be tackling some of the more challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16793)|
| 4:39:55| projects that would require engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16795)|
| 4:39:57| design work, but I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16797)|
| 4:39:59| certainly have an opportunity in Knoxville to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16799)|
| 4:40:01| do a lot more greenways and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16801)|
| 4:40:03| an opportunity to build it in-house, then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16803)|
| 4:40:05| this crew will be the group to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16805)|
| 4:40:07| Fleet actually requisitioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16807)|
| 4:40:09| that equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16809)|
| 4:40:11| yesterday, so those were signed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16811)|
| 4:40:13| That equipment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16813)|
| 4:40:15| a truck and a trailer and a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16815)|
| 4:40:17| miniax and the smaller equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16817)|
| 4:40:19| you need to do that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16819)|
| 4:40:21| I also want to just reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16821)|
| 4:40:23| the fact that especially in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16823)|
| 4:40:25| urban wilderness, you know, when we think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16825)|
| 4:40:27| greenways, that's kind of this broad term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16827)|
| 4:40:29| Those are dirt trails, I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16829)|
| 4:40:31| Yeah, I mean, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16831)|
| 4:40:33| supporting what AMBC and Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16833)|
| 4:40:35| Parks and even our own crews has added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16835)|
| 4:40:37| significant over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16837)|
| 4:40:39| significant soft surface trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16839)|
| 4:40:41| Lori can answer that number specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16841)|
| 4:40:43| I have in my head more than 30 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16843)|
| 4:40:45| for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16845)|
| 4:40:47| That's what's amazing. I'm saying, can we replicate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16847)|
| 4:40:49| Well, I think there are projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16849)|
| 4:40:51| that we can replicate that with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16851)|
| 4:40:53| crew, but when we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16853)|
| 4:40:55| a 10-foot wide asphalt greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16855)|
| 4:40:57| like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16857)|
| 4:40:59| the 30, 40 plus odd miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16859)|
| 4:41:01| that we have, no, those require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16861)|
| 4:41:03| design documents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16863)|
| 4:41:05| engineer. That needs to be done generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16865)|
| 4:41:07| with our team. We can do some of those shorter sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16867)|
| 4:41:09| I think we've done them and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16869)|
| 4:41:11| seen them throughout the community, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16871)|
| 4:41:13| oftentimes those are large, multi-million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16873)|
| 4:41:15| projects, but this greenway crew will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16875)|
| 4:41:17| be available, will be focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16877)|
| 4:41:19| once they get their equipment on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16879)|
| 4:41:21| of trails and greenways and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16881)|
| 4:41:23| Again, we talked about this with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16883)|
| 4:41:25| You can't just build it and cut the ribbon on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16885)|
| 4:41:27| You've got to take care of it, too, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16887)|
| 4:41:29| they'll also handle a lot of those maintenance projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16889)|
| 4:41:31| over the next two to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16891)|
| 4:41:33| as we develop and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16893)|
| 4:41:35| our issues. I was just thinking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16895)|
| 4:41:37| if you built in-house expertise, you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16897)|
| 4:41:39| cost your dollar per foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16899)|
| 4:41:41| costs of doing some of those. I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16901)|
| 4:41:43| Yeah, I think the large ones are just going to cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16903)|
| 4:41:45| I mean, I think I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16905)|
| 4:41:47| sugarcoat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| It's expensive to build greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16909)|
| 4:41:51| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16911)|
| 4:41:53| large sections of greenways where we buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16913)|
| 4:41:55| real estate. If we've got an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16915)|
| 4:41:57| park space and we're going to add some trails or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16917)|
| 4:41:59| a small greenway section, we can do that in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16919)|
| 4:42:01| with our team, but when we go to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16921)|
| 4:42:03| some of these major connections that Lori has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16923)|
| 4:42:05| worked on and Joe and others with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16925)|
| 4:42:07| Greenway Commission, they're going to cost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16927)|
| 4:42:09| and that's what the mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16929)|
| 4:42:11| that's why the mayor has designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16931)|
| 4:42:13| a million dollars a year, and I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16933)|
| 4:42:15| we'll continue to do that over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16935)|
| 4:42:17| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| Any other questions? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| Thank you. One more. I failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| introduce Karen Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16943)|
| 4:42:25| She's my right-hand person. She does our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16945)|
| 4:42:27| She manages the office, and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16947)|
| 4:42:29| been here more years than them combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16949)|
| 4:42:31| Okay. I wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16951)|
| 4:42:33| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16953)|
| 4:42:35| Very quickly, I think public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16955)|
| 4:42:37| We've got two minutes. Chad's got two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16957)|
| 4:42:39| before we start. So Chad will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| forward with his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16963)|
| 4:42:45| again you'll see that Chad and Cheryl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16965)|
| 4:42:47| have a relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16967)|
| 4:42:49| new in their roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16969)|
| 4:42:51| and do a quick overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16971)|
| 4:42:53| and as a former service director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16973)|
| 4:42:55| I'll try to keep my mouth closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16975)|
| 4:42:57| Page four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| Chad said that won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| Good afternoon. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16981)|
| 4:43:03| Again, I don't know if I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| I can do two minutes, but I'll give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| Just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16987)|
| 4:43:09| give a brief overview of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16989)|
| 4:43:11| We, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16991)|
| 4:43:13| Peter Aarons mentioned before, we did lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16993)|
| 4:43:15| codes enforcement, but we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16995)|
| 4:43:17| 292 employees and a $35 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16997)|
| 4:43:19| operating budget, so we're pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=16999)|
| 4:43:21| the largest department within Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17001)|
| 4:43:23| We have seven major divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17003)|
| 4:43:25| We always like to say our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17005)|
| 4:43:27| customers, we hope, don't need police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17007)|
| 4:43:29| and fire, but they need us every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17009)|
| 4:43:31| We're the ones that collect brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17011)|
| 4:43:33| and leaves, do all the garbage collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17013)|
| 4:43:35| clear storm drains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17015)|
| 4:43:37| fix sidewalks, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17017)|
| 4:43:39| One key word that sticks out for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17019)|

| 4:43:43| We've had a lot of retirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17023)|
| 4:43:45| and changes within public service, but I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| just take one minute to brag on our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17027)|
| 4:43:49| We do have a lot of dedicated people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17029)|
| 4:43:51| that work the long hours when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17031)|
| 4:43:53| a snow or an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17033)|
| 4:43:55| or if you went to Rosini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17035)|
| 4:43:57| it's all clear the next day and it doesn't even look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| it existed, so I'm really proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17039)|
| 4:44:01| the work that we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17041)|
| 4:44:03| A few of the key staff changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17043)|
| 4:44:05| we have, Josh Roberts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17045)|
| 4:44:07| is our new construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17047)|
| 4:44:09| A lot of the work that engineering talks about comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17049)|
| 4:44:11| to our crew to get done, so he always has a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17051)|
| 4:44:13| full plate. Rachel Butzler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17053)|
| 4:44:15| is hired as our solid waste manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17055)|
| 4:44:17| She took over for John Homa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17057)|
| 4:44:19| John had been in that position for a really long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17059)|
| 4:44:21| pretty much built our solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17061)|
| 4:44:23| program from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17063)|
| 4:44:25| A couple that are behind me, Miss Cheryl Ely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17065)|
| 4:44:27| she's been deputy director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17067)|
| 4:44:29| now for eight months. She came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17069)|
| 4:44:31| from Oak Ridge as a planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17071)|
| 4:44:33| She has really jumped in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17073)|
| 4:44:35| quickly and I didn't know her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17075)|
| 4:44:37| before, but she's made a big impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17077)|
| 4:44:39| and I've really enjoyed working with her over eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17079)|
| 4:44:41| Also with us is Margie Crawford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17081)|
| 4:44:43| Margie is our admin tech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17083)|
| 4:44:45| so any budgetary issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17085)|
| 4:44:47| Margie handles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| that for us. She has over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17089)|
| 4:44:51| in the banking industry, so she's been a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17091)|
| 4:44:53| asset for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17093)|
| 4:44:55| Most of my thunder has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17095)|
| 4:44:57| been stolen, but just a few of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17097)|
| 4:44:59| that we're working on have all already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17099)|
| 4:45:01| They've all come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17101)|
| 4:45:03| First off is the new building. We're all very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17103)|
| 4:45:05| excited about it. Hopefully in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17105)|
| 4:45:07| we'll be moving. It's been even a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17107)|
| 4:45:09| to get here, but again, we're looking really forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17109)|
| 4:45:11| to it. Janet Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17111)|
| 4:45:13| thanks to IS and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17113)|
| 4:45:15| for the Acela software program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17115)|
| 4:45:17| That has also been a very big challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17117)|
| 4:45:19| We were using a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17119)|
| 4:45:21| calls for service system, which unbeknownst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17121)|
| 4:45:23| to me is the oldest software system in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17123)|
| 4:45:25| city. It was about 20 years old, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17125)|
| 4:45:27| it was more than time for an upgrade there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| but we're working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17129)|
| 4:45:31| Obviously the goal is to expand that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17131)|
| 4:45:33| citywide, so through and one takes a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17133)|
| 4:45:35| it can go all the way through engineering and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17135)|
| 4:45:37| to us, and we don't have to do multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17137)|
| 4:45:39| data entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17139)|
| 4:45:41| Lastly is the AVLs. We're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17141)|
| 4:45:43| to gain efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| We should be 100%, hopefully, within the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17145)|
| 4:45:47| month or two with all of our vehicles, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17147)|
| 4:45:49| pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17149)|
| 4:45:51| And 2016 is also a really big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17151)|
| 4:45:53| year. David mentioned yard waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17153)|
| 4:45:55| and our hauling for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17155)|
| 4:45:57| garbage and recycling goes out, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17157)|
| 4:45:59| we'll be meeting with you all again on June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17159)|
| 4:46:01| 7th to discuss that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17161)|
| 4:46:03| I guess a couple of things I want to add that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| come up. Councilman Palmer, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17165)|
| 4:46:07| mentioned signs. We do have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17167)|
| 4:46:09| employee just to let you know that that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17169)|
| 4:46:11| They go around and try to collect signs out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17171)|
| 4:46:13| right of way. I've had a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17173)|
| 4:46:15| that have gotten to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17175)|
| 4:46:17| We've gone after the guy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17177)|
| 4:46:19| will buy your house, so we've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17179)|
| 4:46:21| to go after a few of them that are repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17181)|
| 4:46:23| offenders, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17183)|
| 4:46:25| there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17185)|
| 4:46:27| the junk masters. There's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17187)|
| 4:46:29| a few that we've gone after lately, but we do have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17189)|
| 4:46:31| employee that that's all they do is go out and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17191)|
| 4:46:33| collect dead animals and they collect signs, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17193)|
| 4:46:35| pretty thankless job, but that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17195)|
| 4:46:37| I also want to mention the Greenway crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17197)|
| 4:46:39| obviously did just come up, but we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17199)|
| 4:46:41| towards, as David mentioned, we ordered the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17201)|
| 4:46:43| just yesterday, so hopefully we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17203)|
| 4:46:45| it within three months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17205)|
| 4:46:47| This is with existing staff resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17207)|
| 4:46:49| so we're not getting new people, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17209)|
| 4:46:51| it's something that the administration and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17211)|
| 4:46:53| as well feel like it's important, so we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17213)|
| 4:46:55| able to tackle all maintenance on the Greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17215)|
| 4:46:57| and again, we hope to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17217)|
| 4:46:59| maybe a mile or two in-house every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17219)|
| 4:47:01| so that should answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17221)|
| 4:47:03| Councilman Delvalby's question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17223)|
| 4:47:05| We also asked Green Capital for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17225)|
| 4:47:07| concrete grinder. This was actually at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17227)|
| 4:47:09| engineering's request. We get a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17229)|
| 4:47:11| of ADA issues where the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17231)|
| 4:47:13| will rise over time and there's trip hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17233)|
| 4:47:15| Most of this is always contracted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17235)|
| 4:47:17| This too will be something that we'll try to tackle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17237)|
| 4:47:19| in-house a little bit more often, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17239)|
| 4:47:21| with that, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17241)|
| 4:47:23| love what I do. I'm thankful for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17243)|
| 4:47:25| to be public service director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17245)|
| 4:47:27| I know that what we do every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17247)|
| 4:47:29| makes a big impact on Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17249)|
| 4:47:31| so I appreciate the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17251)|
| 4:47:33| to have this job, and I'll answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17253)|
| 4:47:35| you have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17255)|
| 4:47:37| Yes, sir. Chad, I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17257)|
| 4:47:39| you about the Second Chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17259)|
| 4:47:41| program, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17261)|
| 4:47:43| is mostly in your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| Yes, sir. I think the mayor put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17265)|
| 4:47:47| some money in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17267)|
| 4:47:49| for that program. Could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17269)|
| 4:47:51| talk about some of the successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17271)|
| 4:47:53| with that? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17273)|
| 4:47:55| sure. So about a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17275)|
| 4:47:57| ago or so, we started an Equity and Diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17277)|
| 4:47:59| Committee in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17279)|
| 4:48:01| I started at the time, now it's kind of ran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17281)|
| 4:48:03| by Nick Bradshaw, and one of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17283)|
| 4:48:05| that the committee had was to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17285)|
| 4:48:07| a Second Chance program, which is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17289)|
| 4:48:11| offenders, people who are down on their luck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17291)|
| 4:48:13| whatever it may be, an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17293)|
| 4:48:15| at a job, and the mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17295)|
| 4:48:17| funded that, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17297)|
| 4:48:19| allow us to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17299)|
| 4:48:21| basically three employees a quarter, twelve employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17301)|
| 4:48:23| a year, an opportunity to work full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17303)|
| 4:48:25| for up to 90 days within public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17305)|
| 4:48:27| service, so they will be a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17307)|
| 4:48:29| of our crew, work side-by-side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17309)|
| 4:48:31| with our employees with the hopes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17311)|
| 4:48:33| A, you know, if they work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17313)|
| 4:48:35| there's a chance that they could be hired on full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17315)|
| 4:48:37| with our staff, and even if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17317)|
| 4:48:39| does not become an option, we hope to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17319)|
| 4:48:41| some good job experience and a good recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17321)|
| 4:48:43| letter, and things that they could take with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17323)|
| 4:48:45| them to hopefully rebuild their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17325)|
| 4:48:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17327)|
| 4:48:49| Mr. Dellibovey, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17329)|
| 4:48:51| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17331)|
| 4:48:53| Chad, how are you doing? I was wondering if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17333)|
| 4:48:55| is any opportunities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17335)|
| 4:48:57| maybe make more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17337)|
| 4:48:59| economic recovery use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17339)|
| 4:49:01| of yard waste. I mean, there's so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17341)|
| 4:49:03| valuable mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17343)|
| 4:49:05| in the sense of stuff that people use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17345)|
| 4:49:07| I know we turn it over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17347)|
| 4:49:09| companies that grind it up and sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17349)|
| 4:49:11| Is there any chance of it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17351)|
| 4:49:13| a cash flow, a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17353)|
| 4:49:15| cash flow thing? I said I wasn't going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17355)|
| 4:49:17| say much. I do want to be, right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17357)|
| 4:49:19| there's a competitive RFP out for yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17359)|
| 4:49:21| waste. So you can't talk much about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17361)|
| 4:49:23| Well, I don't want to get into too much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17363)|
| 4:49:25| and Boyce is behind me as a purchasing agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17365)|
| 4:49:27| He may throw a shoe at me or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17367)|
| 4:49:29| We really want to make sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17369)|
| 4:49:31| market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17371)|
| 4:49:33| has the ability through this RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17373)|
| 4:49:35| to respond. Obviously, we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17375)|
| 4:49:37| the market responds through our RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17377)|
| 4:49:39| and we have a really good use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17379)|
| 4:49:41| for yard waste. That would be our goal, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17381)|
| 4:49:43| want the RFP process to drive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17383)|
| 4:49:45| And I would just add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17385)|
| 4:49:47| Erin Gill with Sustainability has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17387)|
| 4:49:49| on our crew working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17389)|
| 4:49:51| from day one as well, so she's looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17391)|
| 4:49:53| into any option that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17393)|
| 4:49:55| Well, my own solution has been to rake all the leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17395)|
| 4:49:57| in my backyard and put them in my garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17397)|
| 4:49:59| and turn them under, but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17399)|
| 4:50:01| there is value in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17401)|
| 4:50:03| material that has a lot of nutrients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17403)|
| 4:50:05| and, you know, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17405)|
| 4:50:07| moisture-providing substances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17407)|
| 4:50:09| So maybe we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17409)|
| 4:50:11| save a buck. We need to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17411)|
| 4:50:13| Thank you. Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17413)|
| 4:50:15| Any other questions? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17415)|
| 4:50:17| Next is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17417)|
| 4:50:19| One clarification. Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17419)|
| 4:50:21| Mayor Brown, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17421)|
| 4:50:23| asked about the... Second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17423)|
| 4:50:25| Not the second chance piece, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17425)|
| 4:50:27| summer intern program. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17427)|
| 4:50:29| The one that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17429)|
| 4:50:31| designed for the high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17431)|
| 4:50:33| We will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17433)|
| 4:50:35| paying $8.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17435)|
| 4:50:37| an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17437)|
| 4:50:39| which is, again, way above minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17439)|
| 4:50:41| wage. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17441)|
| 4:50:43| say we've got about 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17443)|
| 4:50:45| somewhere 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17445)|
| 4:50:47| or north of 20 slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17447)|
| 4:50:49| that we have. Now, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17449)|
| 4:50:51| recreation. That's all throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17451)|
| 4:50:53| And they'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17453)|
| 4:50:55| starting when? In next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17455)|
| 4:50:57| maybe? Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17457)|
| 4:50:59| it'd be either probably early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17459)|
| 4:51:01| June, and I think they'd run for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17461)|
| 4:51:03| six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17463)|
| 4:51:05| And in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17465)|
| 4:51:07| working, they receive training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17467)|
| 4:51:09| on a weekly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17469)|
| 4:51:11| on how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17471)|
| 4:51:13| do simple things like prepare resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17473)|
| 4:51:15| do things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17475)|
| 4:51:17| to improve their job chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17477)|
| 4:51:19| Well, it's a very important program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17479)|
| 4:51:21| especially given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17481)|
| 4:51:23| some of the things that have been happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17483)|
| 4:51:25| and people, especially young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17485)|
| 4:51:27| need jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17487)|
| 4:51:29| and they need to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17489)|
| 4:51:31| how to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17491)|
| 4:51:33| So that's an excellent program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17493)|
| 4:51:37| Chad, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17497)|

| 4:52:13| 28% of the overall city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17533)|

| 4:52:23| who are part-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17543)|
| 4:52:25| seasonal employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17545)|
| 4:52:27| We currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17547)|
| 4:52:29| have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17549)|

| 4:52:33| but we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17553)|
| 4:52:35| have a class requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17555)|
| 4:52:37| to fill 28 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17557)|
| 4:52:39| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17559)|
| 4:52:41| 38 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17561)|
| 4:52:43| and that's based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17563)|
| 4:52:45| what we know that's coming on the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17565)|
| 4:52:47| So we have 18 officers on the drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17567)|
| 4:52:49| so as we put this next class on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17569)|
| 4:52:51| we expect to fill those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17571)|

| 4:52:59| And so those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17579)|
| 4:53:01| if any council members want to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17581)|

| 4:53:10| 35% of all the city personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17590)|
| 4:53:12| Our budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17592)|
| 4:53:14| broken down, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17594)|
| 4:53:16| The vast majority is personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17596)|
| 4:53:18| We are a human services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17598)|
| 4:53:20| organization, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17600)|
| 4:53:22| it takes people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17602)|
| 4:53:24| to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17604)|
| 4:53:26| So 79% of our budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17606)|
| 4:53:28| personnel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17608)|

| 4:59:04| prior vigil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17944)|
| 4:59:06| on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17946)|
| 4:59:08| and when we speak of violence reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17948)|
| 4:59:10| in the very next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17950)|
| 4:59:12| we had a shooting there in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17952)|
| 4:59:14| and then another shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17954)|
| 4:59:16| I think last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17956)|
| 4:59:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17958)|
| 4:59:20| I'm almost at wit's end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17960)|
| 4:59:22| in terms of what we can do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17962)|
| 4:59:24| actually reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17964)|
| 4:59:26| the violence that seems to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17966)|
| 4:59:28| happening. So can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17968)|
| 4:59:30| you speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17970)|
| 4:59:32| So we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17972)|
| 4:59:34| Obviously we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17974)|
| 4:59:36| a lot of focused effort going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17976)|
| 4:59:38| in dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17978)|
| 4:59:40| individuals that are involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17980)|
| 4:59:42| perpetrating violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17982)|
| 4:59:46| We're in that phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17986)|
| 4:59:48| I think quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17988)|
| 4:59:50| Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17990)|
| 4:59:52| where we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17992)|
| 4:59:54| one, stay in front of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17994)|
| 4:59:56| but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17996)|
| 4:59:58| trying to get people engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=17998)|
| 5:00:00| in working on the other end of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18000)|
| 5:00:02| and that is when you know someone in your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18002)|
| 5:00:04| is involved in these activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18004)|
| 5:00:06| you've got to intercede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18006)|
| 5:00:08| That's a big piece of what we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18008)|
| 5:00:10| quite frankly as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18010)|
| 5:00:12| out there Saturday with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18012)|

| 5:00:20| to get control of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18020)|
| 5:00:24| Fortunately this weekend those shootings didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18024)|
| 5:00:26| result in victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18026)|
| 5:00:28| I think one may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18028)|
| 5:00:30| had a victim but no fatal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18030)|
| 5:00:32| victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18032)|
| 5:00:34| and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18034)|
| 5:00:36| they're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18036)|
| 5:00:38| and we continue to work on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18038)|
| 5:00:40| The main part there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18040)|
| 5:00:42| that we need the whole community to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18042)|
| 5:00:44| If you're aware, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18044)|
| 5:00:46| somebody had said that there might have been a post about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18046)|
| 5:00:48| one of them on a social media outlet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18048)|
| 5:00:50| if you're aware of that you've got to make us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18050)|
| 5:00:52| aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18052)|
| 5:00:54| Somebody's got to make that phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18054)|
| 5:00:56| so that, make us aware of what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18056)|
| 5:00:58| so that we can be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18058)|
| 5:01:00| before the incident happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18060)|
| 5:01:02| And we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18062)|
| 5:01:04| to do those due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18064)|
| 5:01:06| Our officers are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18066)|
| 5:01:08| they're on the beat, they're out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| trying to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18070)|
| 5:01:12| who's doing what and where they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18072)|
| 5:01:14| And we're interceding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18074)|
| 5:01:16| in quite a bit of it. There's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18076)|
| 5:01:18| good police work being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18078)|
| 5:01:20| to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18080)|
| 5:01:22| even more of those incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18082)|
| 5:01:24| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18084)|
| 5:01:26| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18086)|
| 5:01:28| Thanks again Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18090)|
| 5:01:32| I've been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18092)|
| 5:01:34| pondering the new center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18094)|
| 5:01:36| that's being talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18098)|
| 5:01:42| I don't begrudge the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18102)|
| 5:01:44| part of it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18104)|
| 5:01:46| I think we do need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18106)|
| 5:01:48| But, correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18108)|
| 5:01:50| but all the studies and hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18110)|
| 5:01:52| I've ever heard about have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18112)|
| 5:01:54| directed towards people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18114)|
| 5:01:56| young people, really young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18116)|
| 5:01:58| like seven to nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18118)|
| 5:02:00| to 12 and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18120)|
| 5:02:02| everything I've heard. I haven't done a lot of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18122)|
| 5:02:04| but through the years I've heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18124)|
| 5:02:06| that's the age that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18126)|
| 5:02:08| got to get the young people and get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18128)|
| 5:02:10| in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18130)|
| 5:02:12| So, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18132)|
| 5:02:14| it's really, I mean I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18134)|
| 5:02:16| really thought about this a lot ever since it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18136)|
| 5:02:18| announced. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18138)|
| 5:02:20| I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18140)|
| 5:02:22| age that we're looking at now for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18142)|
| 5:02:24| center is like 18 to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18144)|
| 5:02:26| Is there a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18146)|
| 5:02:28| out there that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18148)|
| 5:02:30| proven that shows this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18150)|
| 5:02:32| be effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18152)|
| 5:02:34| So the age group we're looking to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18154)|
| 5:02:36| and you're talking about the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18156)|
| 5:02:38| So the age group that's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18158)|
| 5:02:40| focused there is the 14 to 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18160)|
| 5:02:42| years of age. So what we know is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18162)|
| 5:02:44| from working with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18164)|
| 5:02:46| at Boys and Girls Clubs, Emerald Youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18166)|
| 5:02:48| that the age they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18168)|
| 5:02:50| start losing them is 14 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18170)|
| 5:02:52| They see those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18172)|
| 5:02:54| as children programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18174)|
| 5:02:56| And so they start losing them at that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18176)|
| 5:02:58| So what happens is they then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18178)|
| 5:03:00| Their participation you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18180)|
| 5:03:02| Participation, right. And so between 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18182)|
| 5:03:04| and 24 what happens is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18184)|
| 5:03:06| they start looking for places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18186)|
| 5:03:08| to do something and we have a void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18188)|
| 5:03:10| there in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18190)|
| 5:03:12| for that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18192)|
| 5:03:14| And so that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18194)|
| 5:03:16| trying to fill is the void there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18196)|
| 5:03:18| for them. Now that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18198)|
| 5:03:20| one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18200)|
| 5:03:22| And so the 14 to 24 is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18202)|
| 5:03:24| they end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18204)|
| 5:03:26| and from their own words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18206)|
| 5:03:28| when we talked with these folks is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18208)|
| 5:03:30| they go hang out and they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18210)|
| 5:03:32| bored. And when they get bored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18212)|
| 5:03:34| they do stupid things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18214)|
| 5:03:36| And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18216)|
| 5:03:38| not unlike most adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18218)|
| 5:03:40| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18220)|
| 5:03:42| what we've got to do is try to find some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18222)|
| 5:03:44| to engage them. So the idea behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18224)|
| 5:03:46| the center is to be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18226)|
| 5:03:48| place of engagement. The other part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18228)|
| 5:03:50| the biggest and probably the piece that keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18230)|
| 5:03:52| getting I think overshadowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18232)|
| 5:03:54| that will happen at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18234)|
| 5:03:56| change center is the jobs initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18236)|
| 5:03:58| Number one is it's going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18238)|
| 5:04:00| 40 part-time jobs at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18240)|
| 5:04:02| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18242)|
| 5:04:04| Dealing with all of the pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18244)|
| 5:04:06| that are being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18246)|
| 5:04:08| there. And that's a hard knocks pizza cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18248)|
| 5:04:10| There's a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18250)|
| 5:04:12| things running the skating rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18252)|
| 5:04:14| Running the sound boards. Running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18254)|
| 5:04:16| the digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18256)|
| 5:04:18| board. All of that is going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18258)|
| 5:04:20| manpower. And so those will be positions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18260)|
| 5:04:22| will be filled by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18262)|
| 5:04:24| these young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18264)|
| 5:04:26| What that will do is then build them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18266)|
| 5:04:28| an employment record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18268)|
| 5:04:30| The next thing is the connective piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18270)|
| 5:04:32| that we're working with a number of entrepreneurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18272)|
| 5:04:34| as well as businesses already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18274)|
| 5:04:36| in place that have told us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18276)|
| 5:04:38| they are looking for solid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18278)|
| 5:04:40| The problem they have is they can't find them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18280)|
| 5:04:42| that can pass a drug screen. And they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18282)|
| 5:04:44| find them that have a solid employment record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18284)|
| 5:04:46| So we're going to create the solid employment record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18286)|
| 5:04:48| We're going to do the drug screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18288)|
| 5:04:50| And so what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18290)|
| 5:04:52| is we're creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18292)|
| 5:04:54| really an employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18294)|
| 5:04:56| location in the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18296)|
| 5:04:58| to help these young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18298)|
| 5:05:00| and those age groups come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18300)|
| 5:05:02| get a solid record of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18302)|
| 5:05:04| to be able to then turn that into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18304)|
| 5:05:06| good job with the connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18306)|
| 5:05:08| we've already made with a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18308)|
| 5:05:10| of partners that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18310)|
| 5:05:12| throughout our community that own businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18312)|
| 5:05:14| that are looking for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18314)|
| 5:05:16| and quite frankly have told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18316)|
| 5:05:18| that they have a great interest in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18318)|
| 5:05:20| employees from the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18320)|
| 5:05:22| Let me ask this then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18322)|
| 5:05:24| So if it's 14, how are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18324)|
| 5:05:26| we going to get people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18326)|
| 5:05:28| South Knoxville, from Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18328)|
| 5:05:32| to the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18332)|
| 5:05:34| And is that a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18334)|
| 5:05:36| Is it, I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18336)|
| 5:05:38| It's actually being addressed in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18338)|
| 5:05:40| So we see that as an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18340)|
| 5:05:42| as well for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18342)|
| 5:05:44| employment opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18344)|
| 5:05:48| Bruce Charles is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18348)|
| 5:05:50| Chief Financial Advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18350)|
| 5:05:52| and he's come on as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18352)|
| 5:05:54| Chief Financial Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18354)|
| 5:05:56| at the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18356)|
| 5:05:58| And one of the things that Bruce has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18358)|
| 5:06:00| is he's already turned that into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18360)|
| 5:06:02| an entrepreneurial opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18362)|
| 5:06:04| where we would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18364)|
| 5:06:06| with area churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18366)|
| 5:06:08| and while their vans are not being utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18368)|
| 5:06:10| that would be a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18370)|
| 5:06:12| Vans going around the community picking folks up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18372)|
| 5:06:14| and bringing them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18374)|
| 5:06:16| So that's the thing about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18376)|
| 5:06:18| is there are so many opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18378)|
| 5:06:20| for non-traditional type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18380)|
| 5:06:22| jobs that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18382)|
| 5:06:24| And so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18384)|
| 5:06:26| a model out in L.A.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18386)|
| 5:06:28| Homeboy Industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18388)|
| 5:06:32| where they do non-traditional type work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18392)|
| 5:06:34| They do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18394)|
| 5:06:36| they print T-shirts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18396)|
| 5:06:38| they do graffiti cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18398)|
| 5:06:40| they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18400)|
| 5:06:42| all different types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18402)|
| 5:06:44| that need to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18404)|
| 5:06:46| and someone's paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18406)|
| 5:06:50| So will the Change Center be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18410)|
| 5:06:52| its own stand-alone 501c3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18412)|
| 5:06:54| Exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18414)|
| 5:06:56| It is a stand-alone 501c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18416)|
| 5:06:58| So they'll be raising money to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18418)|
| 5:07:00| They've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18420)|
| 5:07:02| They have money that's been given to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18422)|
| 5:07:04| in the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18424)|
| 5:07:06| to offset the operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18426)|
| 5:07:08| The intention of them being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18428)|
| 5:07:10| a stand-alone to raise their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18430)|
| 5:07:12| to be self-sustaining after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18432)|
| 5:07:14| It will be a self-sustaining...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18434)|
| 5:07:16| So one of the first things we understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18436)|
| 5:07:18| when we built this and started this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18438)|
| 5:07:20| was that we would only want...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18440)|
| 5:07:22| We would only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18442)|
| 5:07:24| one-time need for building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18444)|
| 5:07:26| And that's the current effort that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18446)|
| 5:07:28| That's what the Mayor's putting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18448)|
| 5:07:30| this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18450)|
| 5:07:32| And that's for building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18452)|
| 5:07:34| Just for the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18454)|
| 5:07:36| And then sustainability will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18456)|
| 5:07:38| The model's already in place on sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18458)|
| 5:07:40| We've low-balled the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18460)|
| 5:07:42| Actually, when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18462)|
| 5:07:44| for-profit skating rinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18464)|
| 5:07:46| just a skating rink, for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18466)|
| 5:07:48| they have a five-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18468)|
| 5:07:50| and they have a model to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18470)|
| 5:07:52| what that for-profit will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18472)|
| 5:07:54| based on the radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18474)|
| 5:07:56| Our demographics are even better than those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18476)|
| 5:07:58| It's a three-and-a-half-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18478)|
| 5:08:00| And we low-balled the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18480)|
| 5:08:02| So we see sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18482)|
| 5:08:04| just on that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18484)|
| 5:08:06| That's not including the Hardinox Pizzeria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18486)|
| 5:08:08| It's not including rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18488)|
| 5:08:10| There's a number of other opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18490)|
| 5:08:12| for the Center to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18492)|
| 5:08:14| And so we see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18494)|
| 5:08:16| as a sustainable operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18496)|
| 5:08:18| And we did get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18498)|
| 5:08:20| some funding from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18500)|
| 5:08:22| a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18502)|
| 5:08:24| that is providing us, in case we need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18504)|
| 5:08:26| the monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18506)|
| 5:08:28| to be able to show sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18508)|
| 5:08:30| for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18510)|
| 5:08:32| I think we're going to be able to use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18512)|
| 5:08:34| So what happens is, if we don't use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18514)|
| 5:08:36| for sustainability, we get to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18516)|
| 5:08:38| for other initiatives that we want to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18518)|
| 5:08:40| out of the Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18520)|
| 5:08:42| Given the tensions that are already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18522)|
| 5:08:44| between East and West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18524)|
| 5:08:46| is it really logistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18526)|
| 5:08:48| that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18528)|
| 5:08:50| make that crossover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18530)|
| 5:08:52| that people are going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18532)|
| 5:08:54| from the West to the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18534)|
| 5:08:56| in support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18536)|
| 5:08:58| Yes. So the good news is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18538)|
| 5:09:00| this is a warehouse district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18540)|
| 5:09:02| that has never had a claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18542)|
| 5:09:04| on a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18544)|
| 5:09:06| It hasn't been claimed East. It hasn't been claimed West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18546)|
| 5:09:08| It's a warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18548)|
| 5:09:10| It's actually neutral territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18550)|
| 5:09:12| And that we actually have gotten from a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18552)|
| 5:09:14| That this is a neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18554)|
| 5:09:16| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18556)|
| 5:09:18| It is a place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18558)|
| 5:09:20| the church that is adjacent to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18560)|
| 5:09:22| has members that come from all over the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18562)|
| 5:09:24| From North, South, East, and West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18564)|
| 5:09:26| And so it's a location where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18566)|
| 5:09:28| from all over the community are already used to coming to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18568)|
| 5:09:30| And so we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18570)|
| 5:09:32| that's an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18572)|
| 5:09:34| And the other part is, the only skating rink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18574)|
| 5:09:36| we currently have, or two, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18576)|
| 5:09:38| one, is the one out in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18578)|
| 5:09:40| And they're making the trek out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18580)|
| 5:09:42| So this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18582)|
| 5:09:44| much more convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18584)|
| 5:09:46| A location for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18586)|
| 5:09:48| Just for that operation alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18588)|
| 5:09:50| Again, that's just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18590)|
| 5:09:52| the candy to get them in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18592)|
| 5:09:54| The real initiative is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18594)|
| 5:09:56| the jobs initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18596)|
| 5:09:58| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18598)|
| 5:10:00| Chief, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18600)|

| 5:10:36| full-time Budget Director, Jeff has taken over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18636)|
| 5:10:38| some of those positions. It's a pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18638)|
| 5:10:40| to be here. It's great to be back in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18640)|
| 5:10:42| and to be with MPC. Our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18642)|

| 5:10:48| which represents about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18648)|
| 5:10:50| 22% of MPC's operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18650)|
| 5:10:52| budget. The remaining portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18652)|
| 5:10:54| of our operating budget comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18654)|
| 5:10:56| county allocation, from fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18656)|

| 5:11:00| This year, we've been doing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18660)|
| 5:11:02| of building, rebuilding, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18662)|

| 5:11:08| partnerships and relationships throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18668)|
| 5:11:10| the community. We've promoted some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18670)|
| 5:11:12| within the agency. Dan Kelly is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18672)|

| 5:11:22| between our different divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18682)|
| 5:11:24| We've undertaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18684)|
| 5:11:26| the task of eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18686)|
| 5:11:28| some of the backlog of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18688)|
| 5:11:30| to do that was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18690)|
| 5:11:32| when I came to the agency. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18692)|
| 5:11:34| include dealing with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18694)|

| 5:13:18| the schedule for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18798)|
| 5:13:20| and our approach to that. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18800)|
| 5:13:22| continuing to revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18802)|
| 5:13:24| our sector planning process to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18804)|
| 5:13:26| whether the sector planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18806)|
| 5:13:28| is the most appropriate vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18808)|
| 5:13:30| to continue the updates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18810)|
| 5:13:32| city's comprehensive plan or should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18812)|
| 5:13:34| we be looking more at those community plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18814)|
| 5:13:36| and corridor plans that give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18816)|
| 5:13:38| a more focused approach. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18818)|
| 5:13:40| look for guidance from the council on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18820)|
| 5:13:42| and from our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18822)|
| 5:13:44| With that, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18824)|
| 5:13:46| I'm here to answer questions more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18826)|
| 5:13:48| to do a long presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18828)|
| 5:13:50| Gerald, as far as the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18830)|
| 5:13:52| plan, when do you think that will come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18832)|
| 5:13:54| council? Our goal is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18834)|
| 5:13:56| have it to MPC in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18836)|
| 5:13:58| and we're spending the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18838)|
| 5:14:00| few months meeting with stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18840)|
| 5:14:02| groups of stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18842)|
| 5:14:04| individuals, and with the broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18844)|
| 5:14:06| community. So when we go to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18846)|
| 5:14:08| with the draft in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18848)|
| 5:14:10| it's a final draft in our anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18850)|
| 5:14:12| it would be to council in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18852)|
| 5:14:14| What about as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18854)|
| 5:14:16| overhaul of the whole ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18856)|
| 5:14:18| What time frame are you looking at for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18858)|
| 5:14:20| That's probably 18 months away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18860)|
| 5:14:22| and that's based on the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18862)|
| 5:14:24| I've spoken to four consulting firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18864)|
| 5:14:26| national consulting firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18866)|
| 5:14:28| that do this type of work across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18868)|
| 5:14:30| the country and they've all given that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18870)|
| 5:14:32| We'll push them as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18872)|
| 5:14:34| as we can. One of the things we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18874)|
| 5:14:36| doing is trying to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18876)|
| 5:14:38| an adequate foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18878)|
| 5:14:40| so that they can hit the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18880)|
| 5:14:42| more than running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18882)|
| 5:14:44| at light speed, we hope, so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18884)|
| 5:14:46| get through that as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18886)|
| 5:14:48| Well, I know you realize, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18888)|
| 5:14:50| the mayor realizes, this council changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18890)|
| 5:14:52| in 18 months. Oh, I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18892)|
| 5:14:54| And the consultants will realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18894)|
| 5:14:56| very well also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18896)|
| 5:14:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18898)|
| 5:15:00| Mr. Delaboe. Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18900)|
| 5:15:02| I assume the budget number you told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18902)|
| 5:15:04| was the $1,053,000 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18904)|
| 5:15:06| That does not include the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18906)|
| 5:15:08| rework, right? That would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18908)|
| 5:15:10| a separate dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18910)|
| 5:15:12| That's correct. Would you manage that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18912)|
| 5:15:14| or is that done somewhere else by the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18914)|
| 5:15:18| It would be a combined effort because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18918)|
| 5:15:20| we would manage the workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18920)|
| 5:15:22| We're still negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18922)|
| 5:15:24| how to manage the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18924)|
| 5:15:26| contract because MPC is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18926)|
| 5:15:28| subject to the county procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18928)|
| 5:15:30| policies and we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18930)|
| 5:15:32| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18932)|
| 5:15:34| enter into some type of contractual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18934)|
| 5:15:36| agreement for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18936)|
| 5:15:38| bound to the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18938)|
| 5:15:40| procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18940)|
| 5:15:42| Logistics have to be worked out about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18942)|
| 5:15:44| We're working that out, yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18944)|
| 5:15:46| Dan. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18946)|
| 5:15:48| Somewhere on the books there is a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18948)|
| 5:15:50| called the Burlington Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18950)|
| 5:15:52| Have you seen that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18952)|
| 5:15:54| Yes, sir. I've read it several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18954)|
| 5:15:56| and actually I met with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18956)|
| 5:15:58| and they get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18958)|
| 5:16:00| East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18960)|
| 5:16:02| neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18962)|
| 5:16:04| or the Town Hall East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18964)|
| 5:16:06| two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18966)|
| 5:16:08| And they made me well aware of it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18968)|
| 5:16:10| Well, are there any initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18970)|
| 5:16:12| to implement the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18972)|
| 5:16:16| Actually, the mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18976)|
| 5:16:18| use zoning, we see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18978)|
| 5:16:20| as a template that could apply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18980)|
| 5:16:22| Some of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18982)|
| 5:16:24| from our standpoint in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18984)|
| 5:16:26| MPC standpoint in Town Hall East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18986)|
| 5:16:28| or in Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18988)|
| 5:16:30| is that the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18990)|
| 5:16:32| we have in place make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18992)|
| 5:16:34| redevelopment of the existing structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18994)|
| 5:16:36| very difficult. So if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18996)|
| 5:16:38| adjust those standards so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=18998)|
| 5:16:40| the buildings that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19000)|
| 5:16:42| exist in Burlington can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19002)|
| 5:16:44| reused more efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19004)|
| 5:16:46| and more quickly through the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19006)|
| 5:16:48| and zoning process, I think that's a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19008)|
| 5:16:50| We've also met with some of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19010)|
| 5:16:52| owners there, trying to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19012)|
| 5:16:54| in coordination with the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19014)|
| 5:16:56| department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19016)|
| 5:16:58| community development department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19018)|
| 5:17:00| try to take a coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19020)|
| 5:17:02| approach to working with the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19022)|
| 5:17:04| to rejuvenize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19024)|
| 5:17:06| the businesses in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19026)|
| 5:17:08| I know there are some now, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19028)|
| 5:17:10| private investment in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19030)|
| 5:17:12| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19032)|
| 5:17:14| Some people are working on some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19034)|
| 5:17:16| and something really needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19036)|
| 5:17:18| in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19038)|
| 5:17:20| that's called or considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19040)|
| 5:17:22| downtown Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19042)|
| 5:17:24| because it looks like a war| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19044)|
| 5:17:26| zone. However, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19046)|
| 5:17:28| some efforts to be made so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19048)|
| 5:17:30| I just want to get an update if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19050)|
| 5:17:32| we have any initiatives planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19052)|
| 5:17:34| for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19054)|
| 5:17:36| So I guess you've answered that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19056)|
| 5:17:38| question. And we'll keep looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19058)|
| 5:17:40| for opportunities there and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19060)|
| 5:17:42| the best way is with that coordinated approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19062)|
| 5:17:44| working with our redevelopment department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19064)|
| 5:17:46| and community development department and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19066)|
| 5:17:48| so that we work together to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19068)|
| 5:17:50| the needs because it's, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19070)|
| 5:17:52| it's larger, I think, than any one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19072)|
| 5:17:54| department or agency can undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19074)|
| 5:17:56| on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19076)|
| 5:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19078)|
| 5:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19080)|
| 5:18:02| Quick question. Quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19082)|
| 5:18:04| Gerald, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19084)|
| 5:18:06| northeast Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19086)|
| 5:18:08| road and population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19088)|
| 5:18:10| growth plan, small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19090)|
| 5:18:12| area plan, in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19092)|
| 5:18:14| It's on our work plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19094)|
| 5:18:16| along with about 149| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19096)|
| 5:18:18| other items and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19098)|
| 5:18:20| have assigned priorities to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19100)|
| 5:18:22| and we'll take them to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19102)|
| 5:18:24| NPC commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19104)|
| 5:18:26| adjust the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19106)|
| 5:18:28| and then we'll bring them to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19108)|
| 5:18:30| They're on the list and then you'll figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19110)|
| 5:18:32| what you're going to do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19112)|
| 5:18:34| Some of that, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19114)|
| 5:18:36| we'll want your input in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19116)|
| 5:18:38| assigning priorities because we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19118)|
| 5:18:40| more things on our work plan than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19120)|
| 5:18:42| we'll be able to accomplish in the coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19122)|
| 5:18:44| year and we want your direction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19124)|
| 5:18:46| where we should place our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19126)|
| 5:18:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19128)|
| 5:18:50| Gerald, thank you again. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19130)|
| 5:18:52| Vice Mayor Greve, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19132)|
| 5:18:54| an update on one thing that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19134)|
| 5:18:56| discussed and that's the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19136)|
| 5:18:58| rewrite, I guess, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19138)|
| 5:19:00| There will be a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19140)|
| 5:19:02| amendment on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19142)|
| 5:19:04| agenda next Tuesday, a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19144)|
| 5:19:06| from today, to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19146)|
| 5:19:08| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19148)|
| 5:19:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19150)|
| 5:19:12| So now we have Knoxville Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19152)|
| 5:19:14| and now they want to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19154)|

| 5:19:22| Right. Zoo Knoxville. Smack me, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19162)|
| 5:19:24| I'm sorry. Lisa, I got that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19164)|
| 5:19:26| right, didn't I, Lisa? You did. Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19166)|
| 5:19:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19168)|
| 5:19:30| And I don't mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19170)|
| 5:19:32| uproot Jim, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19172)|

| 5:20:20| through an operational appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19220)|
| 5:20:22| and that equates to about 12%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19222)|
| 5:20:24| of our annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19224)|

| 5:31:45| recently, I think last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19905)|

| 5:32:19| more, so we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19939)|

| 5:32:27| in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19947)|
| 5:32:29| farm itself, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19949)|

| 5:32:39| have been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19959)|
| 5:32:41| for more than 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19961)|
| 5:32:43| because we've been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19963)|
| 5:32:45| in community gardening since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19965)|
| 5:32:47| before it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19967)|
| 5:32:49| as popular an activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19969)|
| 5:32:51| as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19971)|
| 5:32:53| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19973)|
| 5:32:55| many folks are concerned about how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19975)|
| 5:32:57| doing with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19977)|
| 5:32:59| Extreme Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19979)|
| 5:33:01| makeover and that's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19981)|
| 5:33:03| along really very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19983)|
| 5:33:05| Our funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19985)|
| 5:33:07| was $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19987)|
| 5:33:09| to weatherize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19989)|
| 5:33:11| 1,200 homes in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19991)|
| 5:33:13| two-year period and our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19993)|
| 5:33:15| for this September 30 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19995)|
| 5:33:17| to have 700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19997)|
| 5:33:19| homes weatherized and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=19999)|
| 5:33:21| as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20001)|
| 5:33:23| we have completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20003)|
| 5:33:25| 288, we have 307| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20005)|
| 5:33:27| under contract, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20007)|
| 5:33:29| 595| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20009)|
| 5:33:31| of 700 by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20011)|
| 5:33:33| September 30, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20013)|
| 5:33:35| we're going to kind of slide into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20015)|
| 5:33:37| that goal without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20017)|
| 5:33:39| too much additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20019)|
| 5:33:41| effort on our part, although it's been an awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20021)|
| 5:33:43| lot of effort getting to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20023)|
| 5:33:45| but the last quarter I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20025)|
| 5:33:47| is going to be the payoff, so we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20027)|
| 5:33:49| happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20029)|
| 5:33:51| We've already done $3.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20031)|
| 5:33:53| million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20033)|
| 5:33:55| to subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20035)|
| 5:33:57| in our area, most of them small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20037)|
| 5:33:59| contractors focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20039)|
| 5:34:01| minorities, females and veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20041)|
| 5:34:03| and we're doing pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20043)|
| 5:34:05| with hitting the targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20045)|
| 5:34:07| in those areas, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20047)|
| 5:34:09| another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20049)|
| 5:34:11| we have a lot of sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20051)|
| 5:34:13| data processing systems that we use there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20053)|
| 5:34:15| and we just calculated that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20055)|
| 5:34:17| of now, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20057)|
| 5:34:19| saved enough energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20059)|
| 5:34:21| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20061)|
| 5:34:23| either work completed or under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20063)|
| 5:34:25| order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20065)|
| 5:34:27| provide energy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20067)|
| 5:34:29| 72 homes, that would be their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20069)|
| 5:34:31| total energy consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20071)|
| 5:34:33| would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20073)|
| 5:34:35| the energy that we've saved on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20075)|
| 5:34:37| house would amount up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20077)|
| 5:34:39| totally taking care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20079)|
| 5:34:41| of the energy for 72 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20081)|
| 5:34:43| and that's sustainable, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20083)|
| 5:34:45| going forward, so that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20085)|
| 5:34:47| something we're pleased about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20087)|
| 5:34:49| On the back of the sheet, I mean it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20089)|
| 5:34:51| always hard, we've pulled out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20091)|
| 5:34:53| things here that I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20093)|
| 5:34:55| might be interested in, we've done over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20095)|
| 5:34:57| 200,000 mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20097)|
| 5:35:01| you might just look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20101)|
| 5:35:03| at your leisure, I'm not going to read it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20103)|
| 5:35:05| but when I go through this it kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20105)|
| 5:35:07| it impresses me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20107)|
| 5:35:09| I'm not particularly easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20109)|
| 5:35:11| impressed, but nevertheless I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20111)|
| 5:35:13| the fact that we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20113)|
| 5:35:17| to touch the lives of 11,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20117)|
| 5:35:19| households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20119)|
| 5:35:21| in our community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20121)|
| 5:35:23| to provide services to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20123)|
| 5:35:25| 42,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20125)|
| 5:35:27| different individuals, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20127)|
| 5:35:29| all unduplicated counts and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20129)|
| 5:35:31| many of those people we serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20131)|
| 5:35:33| a daily basis, like taking people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20133)|
| 5:35:35| work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20135)|
| 5:35:37| or providing them with meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20137)|
| 5:35:39| so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20139)|
| 5:35:41| that is something you might want to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20141)|
| 5:35:43| at or have a question about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20143)|

| 5:35:57| a very, very successful way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20157)|
| 5:35:59| to keep high risk people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20159)|

| 5:36:31| But that's a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20191)|
| 5:36:33| also because if someone is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20193)|
| 5:36:35| appropriately living in one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20195)|
| 5:36:37| and you can move them to another without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20197)|
| 5:36:39| an adverse impact on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20199)|
| 5:36:41| or an improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20201)|
| 5:36:43| in the situation they're leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20203)|
| 5:36:45| I think that probably would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20205)|
| 5:36:47| considered a positive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20207)|
| 5:36:49| But I know you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20209)|

| 5:36:55| or a comment, I'd be happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20215)|

| 5:37:03| Thank you. Barbara, it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20223)|
| 5:37:05| good when you come and bring sheets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20225)|
| 5:37:07| like this. There's a lot of numbers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20227)|
| 5:37:09| but I think that one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20229)|
| 5:37:11| real values of CAC to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20231)|
| 5:37:13| the community is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20233)|
| 5:37:15| safety net for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20235)|
| 5:37:17| lower income seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20237)|
| 5:37:19| who wouldn't have food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20239)|
| 5:37:21| many days, who wouldn't be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20241)|
| 5:37:23| to go for treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20243)|
| 5:37:25| that are life saving or life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20245)|
| 5:37:27| sustaining if the CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20247)|
| 5:37:29| activities were not in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20249)|
| 5:37:31| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20251)|
| 5:37:33| if we ever look at places to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20253)|
| 5:37:35| this is not a place because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20255)|
| 5:37:37| those people will fall through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20257)|
| 5:37:39| and we'll be finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20259)|
| 5:37:41| that they're not alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20261)|
| 5:37:43| This is really, really significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20263)|
| 5:37:45| and of course the sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20265)|
| 5:37:47| with the weatherization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20267)|
| 5:37:49| is key to helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20269)|
| 5:37:51| people not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20271)|
| 5:37:53| ousted from their homes because they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20273)|
| 5:37:55| afford the utilities. So my hats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20275)|
| 5:37:57| off to CAC and all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20277)|
| 5:37:59| Well thank you so much. I know like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20279)|
| 5:38:01| last year I noted here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20281)|
| 5:38:03| over 9,000 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20283)|
| 5:38:05| were assisted through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20285)|
| 5:38:07| LIHEAP program to either heat their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20287)|
| 5:38:09| or keep them cool in the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20289)|
| 5:38:11| and that's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20291)|
| 5:38:13| amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20293)|
| 5:38:15| clients to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20295)|
| 5:38:17| The other thing that I might just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20297)|
| 5:38:19| mention sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20299)|
| 5:38:21| timely is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20301)|
| 5:38:23| last year we did 2,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20303)|
| 5:38:25| households were assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20305)|
| 5:38:27| with income tax preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20307)|
| 5:38:29| and we figured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20309)|
| 5:38:31| that they saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20311)|
| 5:38:33| $482,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20313)|
| 5:38:35| in what they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20315)|
| 5:38:37| paid to have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20317)|
| 5:38:39| preparation fees and brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20319)|
| 5:38:41| in over $1.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20321)|
| 5:38:43| in earned income tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20323)|
| 5:38:45| which is money that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20325)|
| 5:38:47| comes into this community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20327)|
| 5:38:49| it doesn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20329)|
| 5:38:51| put in an offshore account somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20331)|
| 5:38:53| it actually gets spent in local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20333)|
| 5:38:55| communities for food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20335)|
| 5:38:57| and for necessities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20337)|
| 5:38:59| so that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20339)|
| 5:39:01| economic kind of boost particularly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20341)|
| 5:39:03| our low and moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20343)|
| 5:39:05| income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20345)|
| 5:39:07| And this summer we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20347)|
| 5:39:09| going to be starting, you know we've been doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20349)|
| 5:39:11| for years but one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20351)|
| 5:39:13| folks don't actually think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20353)|
| 5:39:15| unless you remind them of it is that so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20355)|
| 5:39:17| low and moderate income children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20357)|
| 5:39:19| depend to such an extent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20359)|
| 5:39:21| school lunch and breakfast, breakfast and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20361)|
| 5:39:23| lunch for their nutrition during the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20363)|
| 5:39:25| and when the schools close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20365)|
| 5:39:27| and that food is no longer available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20367)|
| 5:39:29| food stamps don't go up, incomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20369)|
| 5:39:31| don't go up, the food in the refrigerator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20371)|
| 5:39:33| and the shelf does not go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20373)|
| 5:39:35| and so as an effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20375)|
| 5:39:37| avoid childhood hunger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20377)|
| 5:39:39| in the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20379)|
| 5:39:41| we will have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20381)|
| 5:39:43| large summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20383)|
| 5:39:45| child nutrition program where we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20385)|
| 5:39:47| serving breakfast, lunch and snacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20387)|
| 5:39:49| to some 4,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20389)|
| 5:39:51| plus children a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20391)|
| 5:39:53| so that's our kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20393)|
| 5:39:55| effort to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20395)|
| 5:39:57| childhood hunger and that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20397)|
| 5:39:59| starting on May 23rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20399)|
| 5:40:01| so we're kind of in the midst of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20401)|
| 5:40:03| a little bit of a logistical nightmare but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20403)|
| 5:40:05| actually it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20405)|
| 5:40:07| So thank you so much, I appreciate your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20407)|

| 5:40:13| Ms. Kelly. I want to ask you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20413)|
| 5:40:15| the case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20415)|
| 5:40:17| Don't they assist with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20417)|
| 5:40:19| medications that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20419)|
| 5:40:21| have to take and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20421)|
| 5:40:23| make sure that's done on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20423)|
| 5:40:25| and do they deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20425)|
| 5:40:27| For some clients they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20427)|
| 5:40:29| help them set up their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20429)|
| 5:40:31| medications, put them in the little daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20431)|
