| 0:04:49| Okay. On March 8, 2021, at approximately 1700 hours, Knox County Sheriff's Office had an underage person working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=289)|

| 0:05:23| My wife, she just wasn't thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I mean, there's no excuse, but she just wasn't thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=325)|

| 0:05:46| However, you do understand that it was a breach of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=346)|

| 0:08:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| It will be the same procedure that Deputy Lawson will make the allegation approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| You'll have a chance to either admit it or deny it and to explain anything you want to this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| It's understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Deputy Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| On March 8, at approximately 1812 hours, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office was sent in to the Weigel's at 2119 Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=548)|
| 0:09:19| They were able to purchase alcohol after their ID was checked and it clearly states they are underage and exit the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| You admit or deny those allegations, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| We admit those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Is there anything you'd like to address to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| We at Weigel's, we understand it's a privilege to sell any underage or age-restricted product, and we take that very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| and that's part of what we do as a good corporate citizen, and we want the trust of the communities that we do business in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| and obviously this is not a way to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| So we understand what we did, and we go through extensive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| As we bring new team members on board, we train them before they start and even touch a register in a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| and we certify them on age-restricted products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| We do our own in-house age-restriction tests where we go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| and we actually do stings on our own stores to find out if we're doing the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Our POS systems have age-restriction items that we have to put in a birth date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| and it will deny the sale automatically if the proper procedure is done within our stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| And we do ongoing training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| So about every 90 days we send out a training booklet to the stores to have all associates sign off on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| whether it's tobacco products or whether it's alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| We do those in sequence and have everyone sign off on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| We feel keeping it top of mind is the right way to be a good corporate citizen and do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| and we take it serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| As far as the individual, of course, that individual was terminated due to failure to follow corporate policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=657)|
| 0:11:07| and that is our policy when we have something bad situation happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Okay, I'll turn it now over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=674)|

| 0:12:37| Big D's 6501 Manorville Highway, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| Mr. Shad, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=765)|

| 0:12:57| If you could come forward and also give his name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=777)|

| 0:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Director Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Shad, you've seen what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| I'm going to ask you or have Deputy Lawson give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| You can then admit or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| And then you and or your attorney is welcome to say or explain or argue anything to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Deputy Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Are we reading both offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| There was one in March and April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Oh, you haven't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Yes, both offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I'll start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| This was March the 8th at approximately 19, 20 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| Knox County Sheriff's Office had an underage person working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| They went into the establishment, Big D's Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| and were able to purchase an alcoholic beverage and exit the store without their ID being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| Again, on April the 6th, same thing, underage person entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| They were able to purchase alcohol and exit without their ID being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Mr. Shad, you've heard the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Do you admit or deny them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| I admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| On what he has said, do you admit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Would you or your attorney like to address the beer board on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Well, it's a requirement of theirs at that time to have the alcohol service course taken before they begin employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| Could you speak into the microphone, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| It was their practice to have the alcohol service test performed before they became employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| On the second offense, the employee was immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| And for the board's information, prior to this second offense, I was in the process of drawing up paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| He's selling that business, and I'm in the process of transferring his interest in that business to another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| So whatever the board deems appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Is there anything else you'd like to say, Mr. Shad, or did your attorney say it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Before the clerk who was working over there, he already took the training, but he still got the ticket, you know, the second ticket, the one on the March 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=927)|
| 0:15:36| But he had his training done, and still he got the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So we did whatever we can, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| That's the procedure, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Before we hire anybody, we let them take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| I mean, they take the training, then we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Would counsel like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I turn it back over to you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you, Director Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I'll first look to Commissioner Busler in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| I see here where you had an offense, too, back in October the 29th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| And you had one in March 8th, 2021, and April the 6th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| So in almost less than four months, you had three violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| And that is unacceptable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I mean, we can't accept that kind of business selling to underage young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=994)|
| 0:16:43| So I'm going to make a motion here that we suspend the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| that we attach a fee of $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| And does he have to turn over his license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Did we take it away, Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| On his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Did we take his license because of one of these three terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| If he has two offenses within a year, you can revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| I want to revoke the license of his also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So I want to just be clear on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Your first motion was to suspend and suspend the license in a $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| You want to change that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I want the $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| I want the license suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| And I want his – can we do all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| No, what you can do under state law, you can revoke the license for two offenses within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Or you can suspend him for X number of days and up to $2,500, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| say it's 60 or 90 days and you can say pay us $2,500 in lieu of the 60 or 90 or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| Director Booth, this being the third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| what are we allowed to do with the third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Anything after two offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Anything after two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| After two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| So the maximum we can do for this right here is suspend the license, revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| Can we revoke the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| I believe, just for clarification, you can revoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| or you can suspend for a certain period of time and impose a fine at the same time as suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| In lieu of the suspension, they can pay up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| I just want to suspend the license because this is less than four months that we've had these three suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| This is the first time I've ever seen one like this come before us since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Seeing how there's two offenses before us, can we fine one offense and suspend on the third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| I kind of lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| I thought he read two offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| One was in October and then one in March and one in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| The March nor the April have been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| The question was can the second offense be a suspension or fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and the third offense be a different action altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| You can do what you want on each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| You've got to delineate between a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| The state law says you can do up to a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| But if you're going to suspend, then in lieu of suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| you can set an amount like you have done already, $1,000 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| It's either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| It's not a fine on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| The maximum fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| My question is on the second offense, can we fine him and on the third offense suspend the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| Two separate offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Well, I guess you could except they're both in front of us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I also have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Suspension means you will get the license back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Revocation means the license is gone forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Revocation can come after two offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Revocation has a bearing upon the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I believe revocation has a bearing on the property itself, the ability to get a license in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| It does only to the extent that whoever comes in and makes an application for that property is in some way an agent related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1240)|
| 0:20:50| I shouldn't say related, but is an agent of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| And I think the state law says that if the property is sold that a new applicant starts with a fresh slate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| and this body reviews that applicant individually of what happened prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Under Section 4-8 of our Beer Board Rules, Section C, it says revocation of beer permit applies only to that permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1270)|
| 0:21:19| or agents of the permittee at the location where the offense occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Revocation of a beer permit shall not stay with the property if the property changes hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| nor may the County Commission apply penalty, suspension, or revocation to the beer permits held by the permittee at other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| So it would stay with the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| It's my understanding that if it's a totally separate entity that he's selling it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| they're not restricted on getting a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| If they're totally separate and there's no agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Commissioner Bussling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I see some other questions, but go ahead and take the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| One more question here too is to the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Is the beer still in the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| As far as we know, we can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Technically, they just have a first offense until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| One thing that will help clear up, someone has applied for a new beer permit for that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| He was the individual that was cited on the April violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| So that will be before the board in a little bit on today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| So the individual that's buying or getting the property was the person that committed the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Commissioner Bussling, are you okay with some more questions before making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Commissioner Stoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| To follow the logic of Commissioner Smith, Mr. Law Director, on the second offense that occurred on March the 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1362)|
| 0:22:52| could we not fine them $2,500 for that offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| And then, again, because now they're appearing as before on a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| which is actually their third offense within six months, for the April 6th violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| can we revoke their license for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Suspend their license for 90 days, which would follow that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| Number one, you've got to keep in mind that the $2,500 is not a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| That is something in lieu of a civil penalty, and that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| So it's not a fine per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So you have the option, if you want to treat each of those separately, you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| and assign a suspension accordingly and add it up, and then what you suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| It's up to this body how they want to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I'm just telling you the max that can be done is revocation because of two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Other than that, you can say, okay, on number one, you've got X number of days or X number of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| the same on number two and the same on number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Okay, and then just to clarify with the Sheriff's Department, the person that is on 7A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| an application for a new beer permit with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| is the same person on April the 6th that was cited for violating the beer laws of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| Correct, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| We can't take that. We're not taking up 7A right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I understand that. I'm just clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| That's a fact issue for this body to determine whether there's any agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I would just like to, first off, last month Lieutenant Lawson brought forward another third-time offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| If you guys remember, it was on John Sevier, and we did a $2,500 fine and a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| This being that close together, I hope we kind of look at what we did last month, but at the exact same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| So what we're saying, Lieutenant Lawson, is whenever we entered on March the 8th, it was one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| and that person was supposedly let go from Big D's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| But whenever he was explaining it, it sounded like there was something else that was going on in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Was that person done their certification at that point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| At that time, I'm not sure. There was a language barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So he wasn't very forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Was the certification done and the proper training for your—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| Speak into the microphone, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| On April the 6th? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| No, he was just there to just check the sale because he was in the process of buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| but he was just there to check the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| What I'm asking is, was the proper training administered to your employee for the April 6th sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| that was underage consumption or underage buying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| No, he was not an employee. He's not an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| So the person that sold them the alcohol on April the 6th was not an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Uh-huh. Yeah, he was not an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| I've never heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Sir, could you clarify this from the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| He was just there to check the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I mean he was in the process of buying the business, you know, like before we got the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| The question, sir, from our sheriff's office, who was the person on April 6th who was cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Let me find that one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| Because what I'm thinking, I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| His first name is Jayendra. He looks like Solanki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Is that Solanki?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| S-O-L-A-N-K-I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Is that an employee of yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Why was somebody selling beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| He was there to check the sale, you know, like he was in the process like maybe of buying the business, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| So he was just there to check the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| I mean he was just checking the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Okay, so the gentleman who you're looking to sell the property to was running the register and selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| Yeah, for that day he was there for that day, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Yeah, that's what I thought they said at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I think we can consider that when it comes to the application time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Okay, well I just didn't know since that's the actual April 6th how highly illegal that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| But okay, what's the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| There is not one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| We're going through questions right now to make sure we get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Okay, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Are you the person who sold the alcohol that was cited, are you related or friends with that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Since I'm sitting here, I'm thinking if Commissioner Bussler, if he is going to sell the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| revoking his license is not going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| We don't need to revoke his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| We need to do a fine of some type because revoking, he's selling the business anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| So that's why he would choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| So what, Director Book, let me ask you, it's either the fine or the revoking of license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| You need to distinguish between a fine and the amount of money that you can put for the option of the violator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1710)|
| 0:28:43| to pay like a civil fine in lieu of suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| A fine is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| The fine under state law is for some other violation of state beer law or your beer law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| and it's up to $1,000 fine independent of suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| The $2,500, $1,000, it's either that or the suspension that you levy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| or you can just levy the suspension, or in this case, you can revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| You've got all those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| We have one more question on the floor if it's okay, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Just following up from Commissioner Daley, when is this sale anticipated to be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1762)|
| 0:29:32| I'm in the process of doing it this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Well, I do concur with Commissioner Daley that to suspend it when he's going to be selling the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1775)|
| 0:29:44| is hardly a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| If we are wanting to hold him as accountable as an owner, I would support the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| It's my understanding we can revoke the beer license for this individual on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| We can then, when the other agenda item comes before us, we can deal with it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| But if you revoke the license for him, that means tomorrow morning he can't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| But on a new application, because the applicant is the one that was cited for the latest offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| we can deal with it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Hill, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| But if something happens to this deal and he does not transfer this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| then he's free to go back into operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| I want clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I want to know if we can issue a fine on the second offense that happened on March 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1860)|
| 0:31:11| and then separately here the third offense, which happened on April 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| and suspend his license on that one or revoke it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Since there's three offenses, you can handle it however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| But let's not talk about a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Let's talk about a suspension and a civil penalty in lieu of a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| so you can treat them all three individually and go seriatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| So could you have a civil penalty for the offense in lieu of a suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| a civil penalty on the March 8th offense, and then on the April 6th offense revoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1903)|
| 0:31:54| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| But you have to pick a suspension at a certain time frame, 3069.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| Even for a revoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Oh, on a revoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| No, it's revoke, revote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| I was going back to your March 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| You wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| But if we did choose instead of a revoke, we could go with a suspension with a definite time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| And the $2,500 in lieu of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| You're talking about the March 8th offense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| I'm going to start back up and go to March 8th, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| On March 8th, can a motion be made that in lieu of a fine, a civil penalty of $2,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| No, you say you're suspended for X number of days, but in lieu of that, you can pay $2,500 to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| That's the way that needs to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| And then you can do the revocation on the third offense on April 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Mr. Wheeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| I just want to clarify, I'm assuming the first offense we've already dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| And I'm guessing just throwing the two cents in here, if all we can do on the March offense is offer a civil penalty or a suspension, it's kind of a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=1992)|
| 0:33:25| We're going to revoke on the April offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| They're certainly not going to pay the fine if they have choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Chairman, since we've got two violations, I think that we ought to separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| We ought to do the March 8th violation first, make the motion and vote on it, and then go to the third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2017)|
| 0:33:46| The chair will entertain any kind of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| I want to make a motion that on the March 8th offense that we put a $2,500 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2031)|
| 0:34:02| Okay, the motion is on Item 5D, second offense, $2,500 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Second by Commissioner Smith, first by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Sir, the ayes have it on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Would you prefer the $2,500 fine or the 90-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| It will be imposed a $2,500 fine, and the clerk's office will be in touch with you on how to pay that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| We'll now proceed to 5D on our third offense from April 6th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| I'll make a motion that we revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker, first by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Is there any additional discussion on Item 5D, third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Seeing none, all those in favor, the motion is to revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Now, the question is, right here, there's still beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| They can't dispose of it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| They'll be required to lock it up and not have it out on the sales floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| And you guys will check in on that, I imagine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2131)|

| 0:36:22| I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Did you all post the business that there was a beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Do you all have to do a thing on the front of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| No, we did not post any notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I think Ms. Daly sends those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| The clerk's office just informed us that they do send a letter to the home and to the business requiring their...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Do they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Mr. Law Director, do they need to be in attendance for us to act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| Well, you know, like everything else, you're a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I think, like in zoning, if somebody's missing, you send them out another letter, give them one chance to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| Commissioner Skinmaker, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| I'll look to you for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Seeing that it's their first offense and they've had their beer permit since 2017, I'll make a motion that we defer this to the May agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2231)|
| 0:37:21| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2241)|

| 0:37:25| First by Commissioner Skinmaker to defer to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2250)|

| 0:38:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| And so Deputy Lawson will give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| You'll have a chance to admit or deny, and then you'll be able to say anything that you would like to address this for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Deputy Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| On March the 6th, I'm sorry, I've got the wrong date here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| April 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| April 6th, 2021 at 1715 hours, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office was able to enter the business at 5515 Strawberry Plains Pike, Mr. Zip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2313)|
| 0:38:44| They were able to purchase alcohol without their ID being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| They were also able to purchase a vape pen after we received complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| We did a tobacco compliance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Have you understood the allegations that were made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Do you admit or deny them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| I admit it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Is there anything you'd like to address this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| On that day, all of our pumps and the register was being replaced, so usually we always take precaution where the ID has to be put in to make a sale or purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| But on that day, we didn't have no register or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| So we were just writing it down and making the transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| And in that situation, he sold it to the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Because usually all of our employees, it's a mandate for them to put in the date of birth, irrelevant who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Do you have anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| That's it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2381)|

| 0:39:45| I'll look to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| I believe it's going to take over for Commissioner Bieler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2390)|

| 0:39:56| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2399)|

| 0:40:07| Sir, would you prefer the 30-day suspension or the $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| I'll pay the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| The clerk's office will be in touch with you to pay that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2416)|

| 0:40:30| Is there a representative for Pilot here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| If you could both state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2433)|

| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Which one of you is going to answer the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| You understand the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Deputy Lawson, if you would state the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Detective Brian Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I'll be handling this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| On April 6th, officers did a compliance check at the Pilot located at 2801 John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| and the underage person was able to obtain alcohol after the employee checked the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2469)|
| 0:41:19| You understand the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Do you admit or deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Is there anything you'd like to address this for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| I'd just like to say that at Pilot we do take it seriously, as others have stated in the past or in the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| With extensive training, and in this case we had a three-week employee who had been through three different scenarios of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| including signing a sheet of paper when she came on shift that day where she had to physically write the date down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| She went through training on her first day in e-training and then a sign-off sheet that we sent out once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| and she did sign off on every one of those, and that's how we do every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| So just a failure on her part to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| I think even she may have keyed her birthday in instead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| She took the ID and added her birthday to the receipt, and it did come up as shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2535)|

| 0:42:38| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2558)|

| 0:43:18| Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Hey, Ms. Pearson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| You've seen everything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| You know what's going to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| I'll just turn it over to Deputy Lawson, and he'll make the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| On April the 6th, at approximately 19.51 hours, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| entered the business Rocky Top Market on Kostiak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| They were able to purchase a six-pack of beer and exit the business with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| and the clerk did check the ID but typed in another birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| Do you understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Do you admit it or deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Is there anything you'd like to address this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I would just like to say it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| This gentleman has been with the company for almost 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| He's been through numerous in-person training classes as well as online training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| He's actually one of our trainers for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Unfortunately, we're very short-staffed at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| He's working 12, 16-hour days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| and we just believe he was just brain-tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Driving back and forth from Oliver Springs to work, he just wasn't on top of his game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| which I realize is no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you, Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I'll look to District 6 Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Ms. Pearson, how long have you owned this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Well, I'm not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| I am representing the company Cross America Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| They are located in Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Would you know if there's been a recent change of management or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| I mean, I noticed since 2014 you did quite well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| and then two offenses within a four-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| It's very upsetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| One manager is actually managing two locations, our Kingston Pike location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| as well as could stay it because we just can't seem to hire anyone to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Well, as Commissioner Hill, we have one question over here from a fellow commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| if that's okay before your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Your first offense was 90 days previous to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| And was the individual that was cited on April 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| is that the same one that was cited on January the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| It was a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| So two offenses within 90 days of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Yes, according to our rules, you have the option of a 60-day suspension or a $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| The $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I'd like to make a motion then that this business is fined $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| The motion would be for $2,500 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Commissioner Durrett, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2782)|

| 0:46:24| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=2784)|

| 1:04:01| and does he agree to conduct his business in conformity with those laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| I can't follow your question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| You've got to ask him that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I can translate, but I cannot follow your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Ask him if he will follow all the beer laws of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| Will you ask him that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| I think I'm not properly sending your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| If he will follow the beer laws in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3870)|
| 1:04:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| And then the last question, has he completed the server training program required by law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| He's going to take before getting the permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| You've got to ask him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| He's going to take permission, before permission, take the certification before permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3919)|
| 1:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| The translator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| You need to understand and translate it to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Has he completed the server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Not yet, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Okay, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Now I'm going to ask for reports of health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| No issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Other than the citation, no concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| That you previously referenced, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| April the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| No issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| No issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| I'll turn it back over to the chairman, but I would make a, if you don't mind my interjecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| this is very unusual that we have a revocation and an application at the same place under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| these circumstances, and I haven't had time to look at the police agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| I might suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| You got to use the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Do something other than screw on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| The recommendation from the law department is perhaps we don't take action on this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| but I'll look to the 7th district commissioner first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Let me ask the officer's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| From what I understood from the questions that were asked of him, that he was the server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| of two of these in the previous sting where he sold the beer previously in that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4030)|
| 1:07:19| He sold in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| The gentleman that sold in March was also the gentleman that sold in October, but he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| just has the one violation, but he was just there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| He was just there, but he sold beer without a license, without training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| Correct, but you have 30 days from the day you're hired if he was an employee to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| that certification, so either way, he sold to a minor, whether he's an employee or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| Commissioner Bussard, I just want to point out as well, sir, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| I just want to make sure you understand, the lease agreement provided to us has dated April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| 4th, so he had, even if he was an employee, he had possession of this business on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| 4th prior to the date of selling on the 6th, so he did sell beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4087)|
| 1:08:17| Mr. Law Director, you said that you wanted time to go over what was going on here, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4097)|
| 1:08:30| I've never been before or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Let me take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| I had not read the lease, but while I was sitting here, Mr. Schoonmaker and now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Chairman of the Board has read that lease and has those dates, so let me take back my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| recommendation and let this Board decide what they want to do, whether they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| vote it up or down or defer it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| I'm having some problems here where an individual was in that store and sold without the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4132)|
| 1:09:18| training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| I have a problem that he's answered questions wrongly but didn't understand the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| We asked him how can we rectify any problems with the language barrier, but he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4170)|
| 1:09:41| understand that he's already violated the law that he's asking us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| In my opinion as the Chairman, I think you have to take all the circumstances into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| that the applicant has sold beer illegally as the owner of the business prior to asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| for a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| In that case, he sold to a minor, he sold it illegally, and there's no way that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| make a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I want to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| So the motion is to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Commissioner Ward or anyone else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I think you clarified for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| He took the lease over on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| The violation happened after the lease, so it's technically a speakeasy at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| They're selling beer currently today without any kind of license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Well, the previous owner, this transaction happened in that time and the previous owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| would just find him and revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| He took over the business and sold it illegally two days after he took over the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| Now he's asking for a new permit to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| I think you're on the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| When this first came to force with a previous owner with three offenses, I was concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| that we had someone trying to play the shell game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| But it turns out the third offense actually happened before, I mean, ownership had taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| place before the third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| You know, this is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| I think there's a language barrier here and this gentleman's having a hard time understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| perhaps how this process is working and also how the law even works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4304)|
| 1:11:55| I know you can't discount the fact that he took possession of the business on April 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| and had his first violation two days later, him himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| But if he had followed everything properly, he would be here on his first violation already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| having his permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| I'll just throw out a substitute motion to postpone this 30 days for us to try to sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| There's a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Second by Commissioner Lundy, first by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| That is to postpone for 30 days to allow more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| So just to make sure everybody understands, he operated a business without a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| issued by Knox County beginning on April 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And then on April the, was it the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Excuse me, the 6th, he was selling beer illegally to minors and the applicant was the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| sold the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| And now he will be able to continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| We revoked the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Well, we revoked the license, but now he's the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| He doesn't have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4395)|

| 1:13:17| Beer can't be sold that way right now at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Is that correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| The prior licensee or the present licensee, I should say, his license has been revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| Until this application is approved, there can be no beer sold at that place, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| If it's voted down, then no beer can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| If it gets postponed 30 days, no beer can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And the Sheriff's Office will make sure that those brewers are locked up and no beer is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| And we'll, I'll talk to this gentleman and make sure he understands that as well since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| he has that lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Let me throw in, I agree with about the, I don't want language to get in the way of due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| process for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And there has been a problem with the translator understanding, and that shouldn't stand in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| the way of due process and being able to get a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| But what I am hearing is testimony unrefuted from the Sheriff and from this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| So it has nothing to do with what the applicant has said or what he understands or doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| I'm just, I think that's what Mr. Schoonmaker is on is I'm looking only at what the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| said in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| But I want everybody to know that I'm never going to be in a position where I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| to let language get in the way of somebody getting their due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| I see lights up for Commissioner Daly and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| The question is going back to what we did previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| What we did previously, the offense occurred on April the 6th, but that document that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| have in your hand is April the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Did we find or did the right person get the, because he didn't, the property wasn't in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4505)|
| 1:15:14| that guy's hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| He was cited, the gentleman before you, Jayendra Solanki, was cited on the 6th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| The agreement here from the, it is also the same as the applicant, he entered into an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| agreement to run this business on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| So he essentially sold beer illegally two days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| I understand that, but he didn't, the previous person that was before us where we fined $2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| and revoked his license, he did not have in his possession the property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| So we find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| He was still a license holder of the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I just want to make sure that we're not in real gray here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| He was the license holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Did we get lied to by the previous person then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Because they were saying that he was just there training, he wasn't the, at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| in time, he wasn't training, he was actually the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| He didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| I do remember him saying he was there because he was looking at owning the business or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| He already had a contract to lease the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| He's already owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| I didn't get the sense that he was disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I think he told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| I think it was, again, I think we have a serious language issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Well, the lawyer even said, like, we're getting this through already, but there's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| a lease agreement there, then isn't it already through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I'm not sure we can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Yeah, there shouldn't be any beer being sold regardless, though, if there are leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I mean, this is very, very muddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| It's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| This is very, very muddy because either the lawyer and the previous guy lied to us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| that wasn't the case or somebody's not understanding or he got bamboozled to some degree as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| I think all of those are valid concerns and that's probably why Commissioner Smith has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| put up a substitute motion to delay for 30 days to sort it out a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Before taking any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| I just want to point out that leasing isn't the same thing as ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I think there is some confusion that needs to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| I support Commissioner Smith's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Right now there is a substitute motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| I want to make sure I'm saying this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| It is postponed for 30 days by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| Is there any discussion on that substitute motion going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Do you have your light on, Commissioner Bustler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Seeing no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| All in favor of that substitute motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| So 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| This will be heard again in the May meeting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| And I highly encourage you to get with the clerk's office, get with the law director's office if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| Try to work out the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| If you need additional translation support, I know the Knox County Health Department has different translators that we can bring in and have some additional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4686)|
| 1:18:15| But it's very important that the applicant understand what it is he's agreeing to and can answer all these questions truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Does that make sense, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| So I would encourage you to connect with the clerk's office tomorrow or going forward and kind of work this out for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4713)|

| 1:18:36| So this is postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| That is item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=4717)|

| 1:34:05| Then we'll hold the first part of our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=5645)|

| 1:44:43| Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| which guarantees the rights of individuals to equal housing opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| and whereas the month of April is recognized by federal, state, and local governments as Fair Housing Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| and in recognition, these governments are joined by property owners and managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| realtors, financial institutions, landlords, tenants, and all those committed to the equality of our country's citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| and the importance of their fundamental moral and constitutional rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| which prohibit, among other things, discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| and whereas Knox County supports fairness and equal opportunity in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| to ensure our community's positive and successful social, cultural, and economic growth and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| and now, therefore, I, Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| do hereby proclaim April 2021 as Fair Housing Month in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| and urge all citizens to join me in this observance. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Thank you, Mr. Vanderveen. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| It's a presentation of Rural Metro Monthly Report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6358)|
| 1:46:08| I see Mr. Bagwell has shirked his duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Or he got a lot taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Sir, if you could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Sure. I'm Jeff Devlin. I live at 940 Weatherly Hills in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| and I am the Assistant Chief of Operations for Rural Metro Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| And filling in for Captain Bagwell, he's got a prior engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| However, he has made me notes, and I will endeavor to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| So in the month of March, Rural Metro Fire ran almost 1,700 calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| of which 1,100 of those calls roughly were emergency medical type calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| motor vehicle accidents, heart attacks, stroke, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| of which that is not an uncommon occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| I think the takeaway for our call volume in March is that we've not only reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| pre-COVID levels in needs for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| We've actually exceeded that level at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| So I had a good fire month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| We had 44 structure fires, however, only $40,000 in property loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| out of a potential of $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Now, again, that's not always suppression efforts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| That's public education, the ability to call 911 rapidly to get good dispatching, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6439)|
| 1:47:27| So as far as what you guys hear every month is who's the busiest, it stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Our stations and halls in Farragut are the busiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| That stays that way even though we've built a new station in the Powell Halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| There's a lot of need up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| So on the fire prevention side, where we do have a public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| with Knox County, we were able to log about 160,000 impressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| mainly through the educational material we put on YouTube| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| in that partnership with our public educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| In addition, the fire department had roughly 300 contacts through various means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| Obviously, COVID is still limiting how we can get out in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| and teach fire safety and other stuff along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| As far as our penetration rate goes, and that means subscribers for the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| obviously we respond to everybody, whether they're a subscriber or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| Nobody on any engine company anywhere knows whether they are or aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| We're still at that threshold of about 49%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| I think for this group, what I would ask is to try to focus on the contextualization of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| that hearing this every single month sometimes perhaps is not really providing the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| So we've had a lot of improvement over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| We also had a significant amount of stability and even improvement during a year of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| that was very stressful on a lot of the citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| So we're pretty pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| The main reason being is that the higher the penetration rate with subscribers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| the more fair it is for everybody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| It allows us to do things like offer discounts to people who have been long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| if people have been subscribers since we started here in 1977, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| So we have a couple announcements for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Next month we've got a grand opening on May 14th at 11 a.m. for our new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| new station in Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| And we also are going to do the same thing for our new station 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| which is Westland and I-140 area right behind the Weigels there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| We're going to do that on May 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| All right, so obviously we've invested a lot of money in Knox County over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| We've got a couple of new fire trucks on order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| We've planched all of our SCBAs, our self-contained breathing apparatus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| about a million dollars' worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| And we've built a bunch of new stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| So the trends are good, and we continue to grow with the needs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| Having said all that, I'm willing to entertain any questions if anybody's got any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| Are there any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Seeing none, I think, as always, you do a thorough report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Presentation by Registrar of Deeds Nick McBride regarding realty transfers and mortgage lending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Having worked with Registrar McBride for 27 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| I was delighted that he agreed to come and give us some really good economic news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| concerning land transactions and mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| So the floor is yours, Registrar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| Absolutely, and thank you, Commissioner Bealey, for asking me to come this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Drusilla just emailed you a copy of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| If you want to look at it on your computers, you're more than welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| It's an honor to be before you this evening to discuss recording statistics for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| Last month, Hanson Sell from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| and spoke to you about the residential real estate market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| and the shortage of inventory in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| Tonight, I'd like to talk to you about the amount of total real property sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| and the amount of lending in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| This would include commercial sales as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| Let's begin with some basics of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| We are recording approximately 100,000 documents now during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| almost 600,000 pieces of paper on a yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| We collect between $25 and $30 million, and 86% of that goes back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6696)|
| 1:51:43| With what is left, we run our office, our salaries, and our benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| and we turn over our excess fees, as you know, back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| I'm proud to say with our efficiency and the volume of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| we've already turned in in excess of $1.6 million in excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Now let's look at the total value of real estate transfers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| The top there will show in 2007 was our peak before we came out of the recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6725)|
| 1:52:15| and at that time, we were looking at about $3.4 billion in real estate sales for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6735)|
| 1:52:26| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| If you'll notice, in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| we've been able to surpass that 2007 number before the recession hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| The bottom graph is total value of mortgages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| the total amount of money that's been loaned on real property in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| As you can see, not until the pandemic did we come out of or meet what we had done in lending in Knox County in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6767)|
| 1:52:58| Why is that number important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| That number is important because people are able to refinance their businesses or their homes at a much lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6780)|
| 1:53:07| As we all know, interest rates, we've seen them as low as 2% on a 15-year mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| and that allows a lot more disposable income for our businesses and for our residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| Let me go to the next screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Here, I want to look at the first three months of this year versus 2020 and 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6804)|
| 1:53:36| Here, you can see the number of real estate sales in Knox County, commercial and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| and how it has changed from 2019 to 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| Here, you can see the values of real estate transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| In 2019, $673 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| This past year, during the pandemic, $1.1 billion worth of real estate changed hands in Knox County, commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6838)|
| 1:54:08| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6848)|

| 1:54:18| Here, we look at the total number of deeds of trust and their value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| In 2019, we recorded just over 3,000 deeds of trust versus this past year with interest rates as low as they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| We recorded just under 7,600 deeds of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| That's where people borrow, refinance on their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6876)|

| 1:54:54| This past year, $1.97 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| Now, this is just in a three-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| We are projecting that this year, in 2021, if things continue, we will hit $8 billion in lending for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6906)|

| 1:55:29| Foreclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Back in 2007 when we saw the peak and then we saw the big decline for the recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| in 2012, five to five and a half of our neighbors in Knox County were being foreclosed on on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6939)|
| 1:55:51| Five and a half property owners in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| That number is down considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| Here you can see the peak there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| Now, this month, I'm proud to say we've only had three foreclosures recorded in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6964)|
| 1:56:11| The first two months, you can see January and February's numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| but in April this month, our numbers in foreclosures, which is a great thing, are extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6976)|
| 1:56:23| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Before I close, some of the staff was going to come down tonight and I was going to recognize them on their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| During these uncertain times during this pandemic, the staff of the Knox County Register of Deeds stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| They adapted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| They continued to work as hard as they could, and they were committed to the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| to make sure that they were able to buy and sell real estate during the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| and that lenders were able to loan money to our businesses that couldn't make payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| Had it not been for that, they wouldn't have been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| So I want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| I know they're all at home tonight, but I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| because with the great staff, it makes me look much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| So if anyone has any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| Dick, thank you to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| I really appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| You said 86% goes to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| I know it's not going to be the $8 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| What number is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| You've got a fee that you charge for each transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| Do you know what that total is and that breakdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| I can get that for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| On an average warranty deed, our office would get $13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| and then we collect what's called a transfer tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Tennessee has a transfer tax and a mortgage tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| and so the register of deeds across the state collect that tax for the Department of Revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| So that's what that's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| It's one of the taxes that we have that some of our other states don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| but we don't have an income tax either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| Good question, but I'll get that information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| And Commissioner Schoonmaker I know knows we only receive 2.4% of all the money that we collect for Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| That's what our fee is for collecting that tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Given next year is a reappraisal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| how do you see that's going to impact basically the sale of homes in our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| So let's just say if my home reappraises at a lot greater value than it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| do you see a lot of people purchasing new homes and moving out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Yes, I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| I think we're seeing a lot of people moving from where they are up to newer, bigger homes, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| I think I read in the paper today more people are putting offices in their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| and need more square footage and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| I do feel that the shortage of inventory is going to cause somewhat of an issue there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| in the total amount of real estate sales that we'll see this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| but I do expect that the way we're going right now will be more than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Last year was a record year, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Commissioner Busley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| On these numbers that you have up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| is it broken down into new construction, existing homes, or vacant land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| Do you have that broken down in those three segments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| No, sir, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| There's no way in which the Register can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| You're buying and selling real property, the real estate that whatever sits on is above or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| I can't tell whether it's vacant property, it has a house, it's commercial, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| And we don't buy and sell by address, so it's all legal description, lots and blocks, meets and bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Nick, can you break down the percentage of refinances versus actual transactions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner, I think if you look at the numbers that I showed a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| and you look at the actual number of deeds of trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| and then you compare that to the number of warranty deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| I think that will kind of show you how many of those are actually refinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| I do take into account that quite a few of the real estate transfers that we're seeing in the last 12 to 13 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7225)|
| 2:00:33| we are seeing a lot more without deeds of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| We're seeing people coming and paying cash for whatever it is they're buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| Seeing no more questions, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| And, Mr. Chairman, I will say it is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| I know your beer board meeting, it is difficult to hear the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| If PBA could turn the volume up or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7258)|

| 2:03:43| We didn't really take a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| Should we do that now before we get into the further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| I would do that now before you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7430)|

| 2:03:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7434)|

| 2:04:04| And to clarify, that would be the education consent calendar and the general consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| Let's just do education first because consent is government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| Can we make that a form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| That is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7455)|

| 2:06:13| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Commissioners, I'm going to just take a minute to kind of walk through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| Last week, we heard from four members applying to be appointed to a primary seat and an alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| seat of the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| Those applicants were Patty Bounds, Christopher Manning, John Marshall, and Regina Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| If you will refer to our commission rules section M2, this is a procedure for appointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7594)|
| 2:06:46| committee members, board members, and the county internal auditor or other appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| officers as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| I'm going to read this just to kind of break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| Each member of the commission shall have an opportunity by roll call to nominate a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| or persons to serve in each vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| So we'll take them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| We'll take the primary seat first, go through the entire procedure, and then we'll come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| back on the secondary position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| Nominations do not require a second application of a nominee for a vacant position shall represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| the nominee's willingness to serve in the position of appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| Commission chair shall also allow registered voters of Knox County an opportunity to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| names to the commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| That's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Names may be submitted in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| That's all I assume has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| Nominators may speak about their nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Nominees may speak about themselves if they wish to add something to last week's conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| After nominations are ended, nominations shall be closed by motion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| And we will call for discussions by commissioners regarding nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Each commissioner is afforded ample opportunity to express their views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| And if anybody wants further discussion, it shall be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| Once the discussion is complete, we will vote by roll call vote, and each commissioner will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| vote in favor of one nominee by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| The nominee with the least number of votes is disqualified from that round, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| go round by round until one of our nominees receives majority votes, which would be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| After each vote, the chair will invite further discussion, and if there is a tie vote, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| will invite the nominators and the remaining nominees to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| And the voting will resume until a majority of votes is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| So just to break all that down very simply, we will begin by opening the floor of nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| We will start as a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| If someone else has nominated the person that you would like to also nominate, you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| have to nominate them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| You just pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| And then we will go around, and then we will close the nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| At that point, we will start again on a roll call vote, and we will begin, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| take a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| And the first person to get to six will be in that slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| Then we'll do the same process going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| So is there any questions about the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| We're about to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Commissioner Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| Is there allowed to be elected officials on the merit council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| Because Patti Bounds is elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7741)|
| 2:09:11| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Director Boote, do you know the answer to that off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| I can pull it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| As to whether she can serve on the two, there's nothing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| It just says that she's got to be a resident of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| I was under the impression that elected officials could serve on it but could not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| Is that accurate or not accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Say again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| I was under the impression that elected officials could serve on the merit but could not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| I don't have the voting right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Ms. Taylor, could you join us at the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| I don't have the rules right in front of me, so I couldn't give you the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| I just wanted clarification before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| I'm going to call upon Ms. Paula Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| She's the executive director of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| And I imagine she will know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| So, Ms. Taylor, if you would, please state your name and address for the record when you join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| And I believe you've heard the question, but if not, we can repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| Paula Taylor, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| In the rules, there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| However, this was brought about, and I believe I just saw Mr. Morton walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| He had told me back in 2018 that an elected official or somebody that served on another board could not serve on the merit council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Mr. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| If you would, please state your name and your department for the record when you approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7830)|
| 2:10:39| Myers Morton, 847 Knight Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| And I'll take advantage of your request to repeat the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| The question from Commissioner Ward was, is an elected official currently allowed to serve as a merit council member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7845)|
| 2:10:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| I'll find out quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| I think we're looking for clarification before we begin our voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| Can I have a few minutes, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7866)|
| 2:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7875)|
| 2:11:31| If it pleases the commission, while this is being looked up, I'm going to go to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| Since there's no motion currently on the floor, is that okay with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| So we're going to skip to number 19, and I'm going to ask Madam Clerk to read the caption of number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| That's resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| It's a resolution appointing the directors of the sports authority of the county of Knox and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| Motion to approve by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Is there a discussion on item number 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Mr. Manitow, I thought I'd see you come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7930)|
| 2:12:20| And, sir, if you would please state your name and address for the record when you address the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7940)|
| 2:12:33| Mark Manitow, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Hey, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Thank you for taking my call last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| Yeah, last week sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Just want to make a clarification for the record that once we vote for this sports authority, which I will vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| that this sports authority will bring all the contracts for us to review before they go and sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7971)|
| 2:13:00| Is that what we agreed upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| I mean, you have my personal assurances, and I'm sure you have Chris Caldwell's personal assurances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| that any significant agreement, and the reason I'm using the word significant is, I mean, they may have to get a coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7988)|
| 2:13:16| buy coffee or something, but, I mean, in terms of the main agreements would be a lease agreement with the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| a development agreement with the team, and related documents to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| and then they would be coming to you all to ask you to support the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| They would not sign any of those other documents unless the entire package was brought to you at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| and to give you all a chance to look comprehensively at the entire deal before you vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| and no, they should not, and we would discourage them from signing any material contract until it's brought back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| They could not possibly fulfill any material contract until they have financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| and they're not going to be able to get the financing without your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| Will they be able to, who's going to do the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Will our purchasing do the bidding for the contract of the construction, or will the sports authority do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| The game plan right now, again, we welcome your input, all of your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| The thinking right now is to try to mitigate any risk of cost overruns is that the team would sign a turnkey development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8053)|
| 2:14:22| somewhat similar to what we did with the Carter School project where we hire them effectively as developer at a not-to-exceed amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| so that no cost overruns would be borne by either the city or the county or by the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| So if we do it that way, they would go out and hire what they're calling the CM, the construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8076)|
| 2:14:43| which effectively is like the general contractor, and then they would hire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| but our contract as a community through the sports authority would be with them as a turnkey developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8086)|
| 2:14:53| We could go through traditional procurement processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| but we feel like that we stand a better chance of getting a more protective contract for the community doing this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8096)|
| 2:15:03| But, again, this is something that is still in the early stages, and that this board of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8103)|
| 2:15:11| and if you all feel differently, this is certainly the time that we would welcome input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| I think it would be wise that we protect the taxpayers that above a certain number, you know, avoid sports or whoever is responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8117)|
| 2:15:28| I am not a financial guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| If I want to go to sleep, I'll start reading something financial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| but I've seen on social media that Knox County's bond rating or borrow is better than a sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8134)|
| 2:15:42| which could increase from a $90 million debt to a $120 million debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| Would you expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| I'm sure we don't know yet, but if you would, just fill us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| Yeah, I saw some similar information online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| You know, part of that information was saying that the cost of the stadium was really $120 million instead of $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8159)|
| 2:16:08| That's like if somebody asked me did you spend $300,000 on your house or did you spend $500,000 on your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| you're not going to say $500,000 on your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| You're going to say what you paid for the house, and that's what we've been telling you all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| Certainly, I don't know anyone that includes the cost of interest in saying what the cost of a project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| Would it theoretically cost possibly $120 million if you count all the interest payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| Yes, that's $4 million times 30 years, which is what we've been saying is possibly what the debt service would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8194)|
| 2:16:42| But in terms of the rating, I was sort of disappointed by those comments because reading those comments is because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8202)|
| 2:16:50| as I've tried to be clear at a number of meetings, if we proceed along the lines that we've publicly been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8210)|
| 2:17:00| the city and the county would jointly agree to make up any shortfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| Both the city and the county have very, very strong ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| Because of that, the rating on any sports authority debt would essentially be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| And again, I know that's a wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| But essentially, sometimes there is a half of a notch difference between, say, what the sports authority's bond rating would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| It may be double A flat, while your rating may be double A plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| The difference in the interest rates in that case would be very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| You know what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| And so the sports authority itself, and I've said this in many meetings, is that it does not have its own bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8253)|
| 2:17:41| It doesn't even have a board yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| And it probably never will have an independent bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| But the way that these deals have been done in other cities across Tennessee is with this backup from non-property tax revenues from the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8267)|
| 2:17:58| both of which have very, very deep non-property tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| And the rating on any sports authority bonds, just based on my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8281)|
| 2:18:08| my guess is that they would probably at least be double A rated and will have very, very low interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| unless rates climb dramatically in the near-term future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| First, I want to say again this is a very impressive group of board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| Very pleased with who we've found to serve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| And I might be getting a little bit ahead of myself here because you had mentioned the construction phase of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| And if we do go the route of the team building with the not-to-exceed, every contract has contingencies in it, such as environmental and geology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8316)|
| 2:18:50| How do we limit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| How do we limit environmental exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| You break ground and you find things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| How do we limit the exposure that's going to be there in overages for environmental and geology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8340)|
| 2:19:07| and several of the other contingencies that are normally included in these large contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| Of course, it will be our goal that we don't bear those risks, that those risks obviously will be borne by the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| They've done essentially all of the hydrology, the environmental work to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| and have a much better understanding of that site than we do at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| I think that certainly our negotiating position will be that risk of any surprising environmental conditions would fall not on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8368)|
| 2:19:37| because we're not the ones who selected the site initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| I think we all, I mean generally we're getting very positive input on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| but no, I mean I think that we would definitely try to have any environmental cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| My understanding is there's been quite a bit of environmental work done already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| We'll obviously want to see all environmental studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| We'll want to do our due diligence, but ultimate responsibility for remediating any environmental contamination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8395)|
| 2:20:05| obviously our position will be that that's not going to be something that the community should have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8405)|
| 2:20:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Thank you very much, Mr. Ramenthoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| There's no further discussion on item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith and a second by Commissioner Bussler to approve item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| We'll return now to item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| I'll call on Director Buch for an explanation of your question, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| First of all, Mr. Morton never gave an opinion to anybody with regard to that issue, whether she could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8439)|
| 2:20:48| So I think there was a misunderstanding with Paula that Myers never did give a final opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8448)|
| 2:20:57| Under the rules, we've got a 50-year-old ordinance here passed by a private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8457)|
| 2:21:04| and we were there long before the state passed its Merit System Council Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| So ours set the rules, the authority was to set the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| and our rules have no limitation on an elected official serving on the Merit System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| The state, when it came in and did it in 88406, said that no elected official could serve on a Merit System Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8482)|
| 2:21:30| and that applies across the state to those bodies which elected by two-thirds vote to take up the law that was passed by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8490)|
| 2:21:44| Now, that's not to say that that's not good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| When I was sitting here talking with Commissioner Ward, his considerations, I think, were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8507)|
| 2:21:54| and he can express them, but whether or not that's policy, it is not the rule in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| but it certainly is something that this board can take under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| My concern was that the Merit Council votes on grievances that could be political grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| so I don't think politicians should be serving on the Merit Council Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| because there's political grievances that they could come up to vote on, them being the political figure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8535)|
| 2:22:23| I think your vote could reflect that, but it's nothing that would disqualify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| I'm just trying to explain my thought process behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| Any other questions before we proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| We'll now open up the nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| Again, if somebody that you are looking to nominate has been nominated, you simply pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| and then we will go around, and Madam Clerk, if you will start the nominations, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| Commissioner Landy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| To clarify, are we doing the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Everybody's got to speak into the mic a little bit better. Sorry, we're really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| If you would like to nominate somebody, you give one of those four names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| If you would not like to nominate somebody, you can simply pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| Gina Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8585)|

| 2:23:20| Patty Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Mr. Chairman, just for clarification, this is for the position, not the offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Christopher. I will nominate Christopher Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| And then Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| Okay. All four members are placed in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| I'll entertain a motion to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Second by Commissioner Lundy. No, who? Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| Commissioner Durrett. First by Commissioner Biggs to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8638)|

| 2:24:06| Nominations are now closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| We will now be doing the first round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| This is for the Merit System Council primary member, sitting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8650)|
| 2:24:18| Madam Clerk, would you please conduct a roll call vote and continue with the rotation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8658)|

| 2:25:50| So she in the first, she will be placed into item number 18 in the spot as the member of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8750)|
| 2:26:00| We'll now move to the second round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| That would actually take her out of the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| And we'll go to the second round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| That will be between Ms. Bounds, Mr. Manning, and Mr. Marshall for the alternate member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=8771)|
