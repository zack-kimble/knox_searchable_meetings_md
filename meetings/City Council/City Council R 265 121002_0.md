| 0:02:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=128)|

| 0:02:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| For the Mayor's Report, I hope everyone had a great national night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| I know I think probably all of Council was out at different neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| This is an annual event where our neighborhood watches and our neighborhood groups come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| to build community and to address issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Really a time to celebrate the fact that they work all year long to try and make their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| We had, I think at every meeting that we were aware of, we had our officers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| I saw firefighters at several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| Of course, I saw Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| So I want to thank our City staff and the neighborhoods and neighbors who participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| for that, for the national night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Also, I just want to let Council know that I was asked to participate on the Local Leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| Council of Smart Growth America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| This is along with 10 other City Mayors and 11 Council members for a total of 22 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| cities from across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Smart Growth America is a national advocacy group to promote smart growth strategies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| result in great neighborhoods and strong local economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| So we held our first Council meeting yesterday, though mostly will be by phone call, but by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| a conference call, but this was actually in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| And I think this will help bring us more technical expertise and best practices and be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| learn from other mayors as we proceed on our sustainability and smart growth strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Tomorrow morning, Honor Air will send off yet another group of veterans to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| As you all know, Honor Air's goal is to fly East Tennessee veterans who participated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| World War II or the Korean War to see the memorials that were built in their honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| Of course, you all know our Deputy to the Mayor and COO Eddie Maness is the Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| of Honor Air, and so he and many of us will be there tomorrow morning to see them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| Several Council members and I will be pilot celebrity pumpers this year to raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| for United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| I'm actually going to be pumping gas tomorrow from 4 to 5 p.m. at the Chapman Highway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| Come on out and get your gas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| There's an article in the paper, I think, of where all the different elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| and TV personalities will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| So I would love to pump some gas for you at the pilot station tomorrow from 4 to 5 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| pilot donates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| I think it's 5 cents for every gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| And 10 cents for everything inside the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| And 10 cents for everything inside the store as well, so come support that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| And finally tonight, we have the Mayor's Youth Action Council that is attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Would you all please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| And I'm going to ask the President of the Council, Graham Treasure, from West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| to come and address us for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| First of all, I'd like to thank all of you guys for having us here today and for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| continued support of the Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Youth Action Council, or YAC, is a partnership between the City and County Mayor's Offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| and the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| We're a representative body of teens from across Knox County that are charged with making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| sure that our youth voice is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| This year's Youth Action Council is focusing on four main issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Substance abuse education, environmental awareness, elementary education, and establishing a principal's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| open forum program in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| We feel these issues are important to Knoxville's youth, and we feel that we can address them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| and benefit our community through our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| We're looking forward to working with each one of you to make our fine city even better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| and we're proud of our community's commitment to empowering Knoxville's youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| So thank you very much for your time and for the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you, and I look forward to meeting with you all next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Okay, that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| So council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Councilman, Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Yes, Mayor, I have one report from the CAT board meeting, I think, when Cindy McGinnis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| was here some weeks ago, it was mentioned that the main office, the new transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| would be a spot for voter registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| And at our board meeting, it was mentioned that over 50 people have registered to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| at that location, and I thought the council would be interested in knowing as we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| to, we're not telling people who to vote for, but certainly want to increase voter participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| So I think that's a good thing, I want to report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| This past Sunday, Councilman Grieve, Councilman Starr, Councilman Brown and I went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| opera at Goes to Church at AME, and it was a great afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| It was recorded to be broadcast later on PBS, and we just all felt really good at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| of this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| But as we were walking back to our car, this lady approached and she said, do you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| these very often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| And I said, well, once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And she said, well, this is great, I'm from Oregon and we don't have anything like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And I Googled things to do in Knoxville, and this was one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| And she had great things to say about our city, and she was just really pleased with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| how things were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| And on another note, I was at three neighborhood watches tonight, and I had some very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| comments from people about the service that they received from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| And that's always refreshing to hear, because sometimes we have other calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| But anyway, it was a good night out, and that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=485)|

| 0:08:13| Center and doing a tour of six homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Knoxville, as you probably have stated before, is a solar city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| And I look forward to taking that tour, and everybody's welcome to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Ten o'clock at the Transit Center, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=503)|

| 0:17:31| This is one of those I guess sets of subdivisions where the developer didn't get it all done or all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| done right and we are we are working under the bond is that correct to get these fixed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| back in working order? That is correct and there wasn't enough money in the contract but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| still is enough money in the bonds to finish this work. All right and for those who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| know we require the the builders or developers to bond off this public improvement so that if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| fail to do the job then the bond can answer for that and and the taxpayers don't have to foot the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| bill. Is that right? That's correct. Thank you sir. Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. I have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| questions. When was this subdivision developed? I could not tell you that. I believe that both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| these this is two different subdivisions if I remember. There's three I think. None of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| actually got completed. So it's saying at least at least one of them went bankrupt and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| all three of them did although I don't have those details at my fingertips. Okay who owns the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| detention pond in question as we sit here tonight? Good question but if if it was developed after 96| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1125)|
| 0:18:56| we have the right to access it and they have the obligation to maintain it and that's but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| know who that who it is that has that obligation. I don't personally know but does stormwater know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah. Okay and is there any kind of a shortfall on the bond to cover the total cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| project? No this is all covered by the bonds. Okay thank you. Thank you. Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| Yes mayor I was just going to mention for Ms. Palmer's benefit I haven't checked on these but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| typically the plat will show these public improvement type areas that are part of a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| and there's often like a contract or statement of bylaws for an association that develops these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| that will say who manages them usually it's the developer during the development of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| and then eventually the homeowners association takes it over but the best way to do that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| be to check with the register of deeds and we could pull those up and find out what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| But in all cases there is a permanent easement so that for the for the detention pond itself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| the drainage facilities yes because they're really public improvement just like the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| and it can't be converted to another use but but the city does not actually own the land but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| city does have access. Councilman Palmer. Thank you. Councilman Dalvopi. I was quite aware of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| points. Okay I didn't know if you did or not. I just was questioning who owns this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| there are ponds in other parts of the city that have some questionable ownership and I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1228)|

| 0:23:37| project. The Johnsons are here with us tonight. John and Janie Johnson the owners of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| and this is 140 year old building known as the former Arby's building for most of you. Arby's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| was there for 34 years since 1976 and I think in our letter to council we explained that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1430)|
| 0:23:59| it was 105 years after the building was built that they bought it. Now the Johnson family would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| to renovate the building and increase its value on the tax rolls eventually and it's a 2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| dollar project consisting of a ground floor retail location and then apartments both running down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1452)|

| 0:24:27| for the Johnson family and want to move this project forward and we've done this with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| combination of private financing, historic tax credits, it'll be a total historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| renovation of the building and then a CBID grant that CBID was gracious enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| see our project through. Simply put we need the relief to be able to do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| The Johnsons happen to be the only people in the position since they've owned the building so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and have a low basis in the building that the cost of historic renovation is just astronomical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| and the only way to do it is with the current owners. So they want to move this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| forward, own it on into the future, pass it on to their family and they're just great owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| to work for and we're very proud to be there. So I'd be glad to answer any questions but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1516)|

| 0:25:57| the proposal or at least consider it and we just cannot wait to get started. We've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| for about two years now and I want Joe to hurry get started. So thank you for your time. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| sir. Councilman Della Volpe. Yeah I just wanted to say that that building is in a pretty strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| location in downtown Knoxville and I guess I'm old enough to remember when Slomsky the tailor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| was still there and if you had too much lunch too many days in a row you could see Mr. Slomsky and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| he let out your britches so I missed that when it moved on. This project I guess will help that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1587)|
| 0:26:37| corner. If if Bob Wetzel's here maybe you could tell me why we have the split time frames. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| the 10-year period where the taxes are frozen at their current level and then from the 11th to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| 15th year we've got half that. What is the reason for that split? The initial request was to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| for a 15-year period of time. We felt like if we gave them the full request for 10 years that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| allow the cash flow to work during that period of time and then and then they would have rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| would have increased over that 10-year period so they'd be available able to pay more so we'd start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| working back to full 100 percent over the 15-year period. Okay so as the as the building got completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| tenanted and and starting to pay off some of those loans they could pay a better share of their of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| their taxes. Correct it's a graduated way to bring it to a full tax basis there. All right and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| you've satisfied yourself looking at the pro forma that all of that is needed? I have and we've sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1648)|

| 0:29:08| I want to call on Dr. Bill Lyons. Thank you mayor and thank you vice mayor for ceding to this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| it's in your district. I'd like to just briefly outline why the administration is supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| program and give it just a bit of history to this. I've been up with the city as many of you know for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| now this is the ninth year and even in the years between 2004 and 2007-8 prior to the crash when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| there were lots of activity going on many many folks came to meet with folk with us at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| on this particular parcel and all of them after taking a quick look at it and discussing it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| the city turned and found it to be a project they could not pursue. The reasons for this were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| difficulty of getting to the project the lack of road infrastructure and the need of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| there and even more importantly the fact that there was a brownfield that whoever purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| property and developed it had to then assume all the environmental risk associated with that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| all the liability that was associated with that. So we had pretty much decided that it looked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| bleak for this important parcel and I thank everybody I hope everybody's taking the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| to look at it and see the condition of that now at the old plant that was there the old industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| plant and see that it's extremely blighted and in a very serious brownfield area. Well these developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| Mr. Harris and Mr. Collum then approached us early last year and we'd had preliminary discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| before that or early excuse me in 2012 and the proposal they had we were very excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| was very ambitious it meant capping the ground brownfield at a major retail site with great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| challenges in terms of traffic and accessibility to create what we thought were in fact the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| bore out were tremendous economic opportunity for people who lived in the core of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| and the only problem the only thing that gave us any pause was that it was of such an ambitious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| project that the financing of it was very difficult and we discussed that with Mr. Harrison and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| Collum that the only way that this could possibly work would be through city participation to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| tax increment financing which as you know the is a function of the amount of investment that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| into the site the large enough investment will produce enough new taxes that that will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| to pay for a lot of infrastructure to make this project work that because there were 25 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| dollars in site preparation costs prior to even construction of the actual development was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| a part of what we'd get them with maximum participation by the developer maximum amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| of money that they could borrow there were still gigantic holes in the financing we urged them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| pursue and and they suggested what they had suggested a very difficult way to to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| this but one we had observed we had had success within the city before and that was new market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| tax credits which are very competitive at that time there was some discussion of pursuing a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| changes in state legislation that would have allowed some sales tax to go that the state had set up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| brownfield areas because of the importance of remediating this and getting this environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| house in order on that important site we encourage them instead really go after the new markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| if hopefully we'll be able to put the package together that is the package that we brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| you and we appreciate the nine oh vote I believe it was for the taxing of it financing for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| original iteration of this project subsequent to that and that's why we're here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| the do no fault of theirs the new market tax credits they came up far short because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| competitive nature of these and banks granting them through for briars reasons to some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| developments again these are very competitive so they approached us at the city number of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| and said this project is now three billion dollars underwater and would we and with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| continue consider investing in some of the infrastructure with them so that we can make this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| work and internally after many discussions we came back to them with the suggestion that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| recommend of course has to go to you folks recommend the council that we split the difference if they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| they would still be one and a half short of they could pursue whatever they needed to come up with that that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| recommend to council a million and a half dollars to go to roads and bridges associated with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| okay now why are we bringing this to you and why is this important the first of all we can take a pure return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| on investment obviously we would love for the city to have to put nothing in on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| have private developers come up with sixty five million dollars finance all the all the associated improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| and all the infrastructure at this site there is no road to the site there is a brownfield there needs to be new bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| and new bridge construction this is so prohibitively expensive that we thought that we would recommend doing what cities do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| which is we build infrastructure to support later private investment for the purpose not only of increasing the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| because in the immediately the we between property tax and sales tax we think it's conservative estimates will be three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| hundred thousand dollars a year in new revenue immediately upon this project's opening and far in excess of that seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| eight hundred thousand a year once the tip rolls off into the future so we thought this was a good investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| and in for just for the city taxpayer but we also thought and this is really what's critical this project makes an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| incredible statement to the to to the development community to residents to potential business owners the people who would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| here about the success of what we have going on in the core of the city and about the kind of urban development I want to stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| this is urban development this is not what you would associate with the usual retail development a very large parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| and sprawled over a large area this is structured parking which is expensive a more more of a vertical array| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| fitting in an environment in a responsible manner so our feeling was that the not only the tax revenue but the economic activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| that the opportunity for those who live close to have job opportunities to work there the construction expenditures that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| made at this time in a rather fragile economy any number of reasons led led us to think that the wise course and we think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| essential course is to make sure that this development moves forward a couple of things briefly about why why we think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| important and we think it's important to put it in a little broader context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| First of all some folks have said but this is an extremely large tiff that they have well our response to that is the size of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| tiff is completely a project of the size of the private investment and that will also reflects the amount of taxes the city will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| eventually get the larger the tiff doesn't exert that it's any more that the city's doing to to to affect the transfer to somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| it reflects the private investment that generates that amount of tax revenue that we would put back into that project for a period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| time so the larger the tiff the better and always has been our approach to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Secondly we think that what we have left and I want to stress this is for a second for context in the city is we don't have easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| parcels we have a lot of very challenging parcels many of which are in environmentally contaminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| or have old buildings on them or on very difficult sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| This is just one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| You've got the old Baptist Hospital site the standard knitting mill site everything out the central Broadway industrial corridor where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| have opportunities to produce tremendous development but the in and of itself there are enough negatives associated with these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| never work with with any private person coming to make to make use of the usual sense of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| In the usual redevelopment project the city would have the developer pay for the public infrastructure associated with that project and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| think of those as a redevelopment parcel along one of our arterials where maybe a traffic light is added a few turn lanes are added some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| street improvements are added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| This is and this is where I'm going to segue into why this is a unique situation though with generalizable principles that we think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| This site is incredibly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| It doesn't have a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| It's environmentally contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Every drop of water that goes out of that that would enter into the water system is going to have to be and should be completely clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2242)|
| 0:37:31| before it leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| The this will be monitored by T deck and in all other agencies that work on these sorts of things and we think that having this project in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2252)|
| 0:37:43| this area with this kind of investment in this type of structure is sent is a message that the core of the city is alive and well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| It will benefit Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| It'll it'll do all the sorts of things that we want because and this is the key point I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| If because the pensions have been raised in the pension challenges and other cost challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| Our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Their only chance we have to grow the revenue base for the city is through new development and the new development has got to occur in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2284)|
| 0:38:13| challenging areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| We cannot benefit from inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| The property tax rates are adjusted every time there's appraisal overall in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| So the new development is what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And when we have these difficult situations are strong conviction is we have to participate in the infrastructure was just as an extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| what we usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| So the in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| What we're asking you to do is support this extension of the kind of development we think and changing the development paradigm to one which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| recognizes the difficult challenges and the kind of participation the city will have to make because we're going to want folks to come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| with very large very challenging very ambitious projects and with which they the developer goes tremendously at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2330)|
| 0:39:00| I'll close by saying the city as it will be at no risk in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| We're asking you and believe me, we'd rather not have to take this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| But we're asking you to vote on putting 1.5 million toward infrastructure in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| The details which we will bring back that will assure that that money does not go to the developer until the conclusion of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| and will be the last money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| The this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| If we can proceed with this project, I think that it will be extremely successful and it will add greatly to the city's bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| And I think even more importantly, it will provide all kinds of opportunities for people who live in neighborhoods like Westview and Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| and Mechanicsville and Park Ridge and all the close neighborhoods who right now you want to talk about where a lot of job opportunities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| You may have to tell them they have to go all the way to Turkey Creek or someplace like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| So we really think the economic opportunity associated with this for the citizens is every bit as important as the opportunity for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| And if we don't strategically invest money to get a good return to increase the tax flow we have coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| we will not be able to meet the increased cost of government that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| So that is basically all I had to say to explain why the administration brings this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| It's an unusual request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| We think it's a very atypical and unusual situation that merits this response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| And it's typical of other situations that we will probably face in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| And we hope we have folks bringing proposals to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| You wouldn't think I could add to that, but I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| Very well spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I think you framed it up about as good as it can be framed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| But I'd like to go back a little bit in time, and then I want to talk specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| This is my district and how it affects my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| And let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| You know, where I live, we go nine miles one way for one grocery store out of John Sevier Highway and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2453)|
| 0:41:04| And my wife and I are busy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| And we go on Saturday afternoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And if they're out of something, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| It's next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| We don't have time to make that trek every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| So that's just one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| That's just one little area of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Guess where a lot of the people go to shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| They go to Blount County because they've got choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| They've got a Kroger over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| They've got Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| They've got Foodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| They've got Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| And so to say that, you know, I just want to diffuse the argument that it's tit for tat, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| they're going to Kroger and West Hills or Kingston Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and now they're just going to go over here and it's the same tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| There's a lot of people that live out Alcoa Highway, a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| And they're going to Blount County to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| So given, you know, hopefully this will pass tonight, folks that live at the very end of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2511)|
| 0:42:00| I mean, you can't get any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| You're in a river if you go any further, and then you're in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| But it will be closer for me to come to this Publix and to everything else that will open there and shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| So don't think that this is just we're just swapping tax dollars out because we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| You know, I really appreciate the point about the blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| and I'm not going to belabor everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| But that is a key entrance into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| We've got a huge, beautiful university there, and they're doing a lot of renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| People get off the interstate, and the first thing they see is a blighted brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| And this is a great opportunity for us to fix that and really make the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| And it's not only the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, really, to me, it's downtown, and we just keep extending and extending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| So I think it's a great, great investment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Look at this agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| You know, we've got road project in here, $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| We've got culverts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| We've got retaining ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| We've got all these projects that are important to the infrastructure of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| They don't give us anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| It's important to have good roads and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| This alone, just the property tax alone goes from $7,000 to $120,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| not to mention the sales tax and the jobs and everything else that Dr. Lyons mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| So, you know, I think, again, it's a great project for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| And let me go back when I first ran for office back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| 1890s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| No, it was the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| But, you know, I was in favor of a $4 million investment for roads at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| And, man, I mean, it was controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| People were just like, oh, my God, have you all lost your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| You can't support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I don't know what the tax dollars, what we get off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| I bet Dr. Jim York back there, he could probably tell me, doctor, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| But it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I guarantee you, if it's not the largest in the city, I'd be shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| It was a small investment in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| And that's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| We're talking about roads and essential things that cities should provide to make a city vibrant and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| You know, we just approved, you know, a great project that's going to go on downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| you know, private money again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| I can remember back 20 years ago, downtown, we all know what it looked like and what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| Now we're talking about an 800-square-foot apartment going for $1,500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| I mean, what a great success story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| We invested $12.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| The city invested $12.5 million in Market Square and downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| And look what you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| You can go down here practically any night of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| You have to wait in restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| We've got more people than we've ever had living downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| We've got new restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| We've got new shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| We've got urban outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| We've got all these people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And it's all because we've given the dollars to the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Sometimes it just can't happen other than the city helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| And that's all this is, is just helping this project move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| So, I mean, I hope that, you know, this council will approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| I've been through these battles before, and people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| you're all wasting our tax dollars, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I mean, I feel very confident moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| So I hope council will approve this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Not much to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Maybe just to reinforce a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| I think one of the key things is that this is an infrastructure mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| It's not a blank check to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis pointed out Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| and I'm sure that he and others who were on council at the time took heavy artillery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| for the folly of going out in the wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| When West Town Mall was developed, there was a lot of folly about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| This is a brownfield, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| It's generating $7,000 in property tax each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| The runoff from that poisons the creek and downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| We're looking at people who are probably in the minds of many, very crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| to consider developing this, making that brownfield a safe place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| and bringing a grocery store and a Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And I dare say if we were talking about Target instead of Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| probably there would be fewer comments than there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| But I'm thinking about the grocery store, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| One of the comments that we hear from folks who live downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| who live in Fort Sanders and some other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| is we don't have a very good choice of grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| There are some great little markets, and those will continue to thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| but we don't have a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Vice Mayor Pavlis talks about driving nine miles one way to the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and he has a choice of one store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| We like to think that people have choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Publix is a huge attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| We went to the Publix at North Shore the weekend it opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Probably not a wise decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| We should have waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| But we looked at the cars in the parking lot, and I told my husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| we need to send thank you notes to Blount County, Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| McMinn County, and some other severe county for coming to shop at that Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| because they're bringing us money that we would not otherwise have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And I think that this Publix at this location will give shoppers another opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| and it's not that it's going to take money from the Kroger on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| or the Food City at Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| People will probably spend more money and eat more because they have more choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| We all talk about leaner, meaner, thinner society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| I'm not seeing it happen, but there are a lot of healthy choices at Publix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| So I'm going to be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| We have some council members who are concerned about some other revenue needs of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| and I would say to you this is an opportunity for us to make a totally wasted, nonproductive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| virtually non-generating tax site productive, generating money to help fill some of those holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| that we have for some serious issues coming down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| I'm going to be supporting this because it is the thing to do to help our city move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| and I really hope that we can have the colleagues on council join in to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I'm not going to repeat the things that Councilwoman Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| You want me to, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Or what Councilman Pavlis had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| But I would like to just bring up one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and I'd really like to talk to Mr. Cullum and Mr. Harrison and ask them a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| if they could come forward, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| As many of you on council know, for a long time we thought this was in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| and I just want to bring that up one more time that I'm really going to, I guess, let Mr. Pavlis have it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| It's the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| I guess it was more than what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| It might have been two years ago that we started looking at this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and I know you folks got in touch with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| It may have been longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| But one of the concerns that has been expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| and I just want you folks to make a statement to the fact that one of the concerns that we have is when we begin a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| and start into it, one of the things that ends up happening is we have value engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| and a number of people have looked at what you've presented to us so far as far as the schematics and the design development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| and I would just like to have an assurance that what we have seen is what we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| In other words, we're not going to end up with two big brick boxes sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| And so how can you folks answer that to us, you know, at this particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Because I think what you've done is extremely commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I think from an architectural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| it's going to be a real asset to the entrance to Cumberland as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| But I just want to have some assurance that we're not going to end up with a couple of brick boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| that you're going to continue with the train station and the look that you've presented to us so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| And please state your name and address to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| Councilman Grieve, those are excellent questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| I think to answer your first question, what is the assurance that they're going to look the way that we had presented them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| I would say that those plans, first of all, the city of Knoxville has to ultimately approve our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| or we don't get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| And what we have presented have been in public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and if those plans differ substantially from what we presented in the public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| I feel very certain that the staff that is hired and is charged with making sure that those are what we presented will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3063)|
| 0:51:13| Those plans are already in, substantially into the city for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| There have been comments and resubmittals, if I'm not mistaken, already made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| and we're still working toward final permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| And I think I might add that one other thing, as you heard Dr. Lyons say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| this money, if this council approves it, would be the last money into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| So at that point, when we're $60-something million into this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| and there's a million and a half waiting to come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I think you'll know whether we built those boxes the way we were supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| And I hope you understand that I do understand I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| No, no, that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| It's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| And also I want to say, and I want to commend both you and Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| that this is a project that, as far as a city council person, as far as an elected official that I've been involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| that I want to commend both of you for the efforts that you put forth in terms of having the public input that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| and talking to the neighborhoods and talking to the Bearden Council and these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I think that you've done a tremendous job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I think you've come to us with the project in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| showing us ahead of time what it is that we're going to get and what it is that you plan to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| And I think you should be definitely commended on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And along with Councilman Palmer and as well as Councilman Pavlis, I'll be supporting this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| But I really appreciate all that you've done, and I'm really looking forward to this project moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I have two things to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| One is a procedure one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| I'd like to split this into the approval or disapproval of the Sertoma and then the Fulton Bellows separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| because I certainly feel, you know, I think the Sertoma issue needs to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| We've talked about it in the past at the budget hearings, and I don't want to see it lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| So I'd move to divide the question so we can get that out of the way unless there's some objections to the Sertoma thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I would ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| So we have a motion and a second to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you for bringing up Sertoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| I was going to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Sertoma Center was inadvertently omitted in our community grants this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| It was not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| And so by this decision, we will fund their $19,650 grant, and they do great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| So, okay, so we have a motion and a second to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| This is to divide the question first, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| And then we would vote on each question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Each individual item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| So the question is divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Now, I don't know whether we want to vote on that or just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Do you want to go ahead and do Sertoma Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Yeah, if we could do Sertoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| I think it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Mayor, just as a point of reference, just because I haven't seen this done this way before, why was it put together to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| Why is this on the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Because right now what we're doing is amending our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And often several items will come to you together when we amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Is that correct, Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Yes, that's why it's together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Okay, is there a motion to approve the $19,650 grant for Sertoma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| I'll move to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| The second part is I wanted to address the Fulton Bellows or union project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| What troubles me about this is not the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| We have heard quite a good deal about this project back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And on April 17th, we were presented with KCDC's development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| And within that, the $10 million TIF or tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| and the information memo that was prepared by Bob Wetzel and presented to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| at that time in selling the action on that activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| and we did talk about it and debate it a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| But the memo said, specifically contained within this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| and by plan I mean the KCDC redevelopment and urban renewal plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| is authorization for tax increment financing not to exceed $10 million for a term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| not to exceed 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| The second sentence is the one I want to call to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| This financing would allow for University Commons LLC to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| and improve certain public infrastructure deemed necessary to support the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| of an urban retail center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| And we debated that night all about that and why we're given $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| and why the 25-year term, it seemed awfully long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| But at the end of the day, we voted to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| And now we're back because, gosh, either the infrastructure costs more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| or the money we were counting on from somewhere else doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| or exist in the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| I guess it's the Market Street tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| And they come to Big Brother the city for this money when we already put $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| to help the infrastructure along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| And I'm upset that we're back here at this point again being nibbled at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| for another $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| They wanted $3 million, but our guys fought it down to $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And we're back here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| At the April 17th meeting, Nick Pavlis was the primary spokesman, I think, for this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| along with Mr. Bud Collum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| But he said specifically, and you can go back to the community TV station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| and watch the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| It's on archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| He said the taxpayers are not putting any new dollars into this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| We're going to do the tax increment financing, and we're going to forego receiving that higher tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| on the improved site, but we're not going to put any dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| And he called on Mr. Bud Collum, who walked up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| and he said the taxpayers are not being asked to write a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| They are not at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| And we voted with that premise that we were in this with them, with the TIF, to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| And we realize, everyone realizes, it's a very challenged site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| It's small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| It's contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| It's in a funny spot with all those railroad tracks and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| But that's the bridge we crossed in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Okay, second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Meantime, back at the ranch, we have a pension plan that's got great costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| and I think Dr. Lyons even mentioned maybe this will help by increasing some monies that we'll earn downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| when this project opens in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| We might get some more sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Maybe it will be transferred from someplace in Bearden or something to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| I don't think we're going to sell more broccoli, but you can debate that all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| The point is that we had a year ago, when the budget year ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| $28 million in the unassigned or free part of the city's fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| It's the real part of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Everything else is committed to some project or assigned for some use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| or restricted to something like, you know, drug enforcement or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| It's monies we receive from some entity that we can only spend a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| But that $28 million has now shrunk considerably, and there's some dispute about the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| because we don't have the audited financial statement for the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| But it's somewhere between $11 million and maybe as much as $19 million, but it's shrunk already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| And if you remember, back in May, we gave $10 million to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| We authorized $2.5 million to go for the State Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| and that money is probably coming out of this pot and into the regular operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| And more recently, I think we've worked on the TVA Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| and we're going to give another $2.5 million to that activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and that's not coming from anything other than what we call the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Well, there are big rainstorms coming, and I'm concerned that when we go to look in the kitty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| it's going to be empty, not totally empty, but getting smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| And that's a matter of some concern to the taxpayers, because we all know when that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| we're either going to cut salaries, we're going to cut the budget some other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| or we're going to raise taxes, or we're going to stop doing some services that we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| So having a fund to fall back on is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| It's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Let me say one other point, and that is that, well, I'm going to say two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| One is that I think it's wrong for the city to pick winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| I've heard talk from others about, gosh, we do infrastructure improvement elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| but when we go into Market Square, there's probably 20 or 30 businesses down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| that have access to the Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| We're not picking one developer to favor over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| What happens when some grocery store on Kingston Pikes comes here next year and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| my business is cut in half, now that you built this thing, everyone's going to the hot new Publix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Maybe that's tough luck, but since it was funded with public money, I need some money to fix up my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| I mean, we're picking winners and losers in the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| and I'm a little nervous about the city doing that because it's directed to one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| All right, it's a project we all like, so maybe you can bend the rules a bit, but that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| And the final point, and I think this is a significant one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| I hadn't thought about it much until I started reading the background papers today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| but back in April when we approved KCDC's plan, which had the financing arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| and spelled out how they were going to spend the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| it pretty clearly said under the section, I guess it's on page 15 of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| I don't know what its actual page number is in the city council records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| but this is part of the ordinance or resolution that we adopted, and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| let's see, any amendments to this plan, that's the KCDC plan which had the incremental financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| and outlined the project, and that was a plan that was adopted after public hearings, public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| and a lot of vetting at KCDC and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| It says any amendments to this plan will only be adopted by city council after a public hearing is conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| in the same manner as the hearing was conducted prior to the adoption of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| and where applicable in compliance with the requirements of section 13-20-205 of the Tennessee Code Annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| and it goes on to describe that, but it was clearly adopted as part of a redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| that had a procedure in place on how you amend it, and it requires public hearing and public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| and we've totally ignored that, and are now going to change this plan to throw in a million and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| I don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I certainly don't think we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| If this is going to be the approach we're going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| I think it should be vetted in the manner that was set up for a redevelopment project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| and we're not doing that, and I'm questioning the legality of going forward on this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| as opposed to after we touch the bases and find out what's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| I'm going to call on Dr. Lyons to address that final point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| The redevelopment plan is specifically for tax increment financing, and what the reference is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| is any change in the TIF procedures would have to go through all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| No, it says any change in the plan, and the plan is the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| The plan is the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| That's a formal document under state law that has to do with redevelopment areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| and what one has to do to have in place prior to tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| and that plan, of course, had all the goals and everything else, but that's specific to the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| You're saying that doesn't apply to this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| It does not apply to this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So we're down to, even though I like this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I wonder why they're not talking to other big bucks developers to join in their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| and take a piece of the action and do this with private money rather than scarce taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| If we're going to put a million and a half in and they're putting five million in cash in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| we're a 25 percent participant on cash basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| We ought to share 25 percent of the profit as a limited partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Why are we giving taxpayer monies away is the point I want to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Well, I could address that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| They are borrowing a tremendous amount of money for which they are responsible for paying back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| That counts just as when you purchase a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| It's not just your down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| You are obligated for the entire amount of the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| I'll take a smaller percentage then, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| A smaller percentage of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| The profit, since we're still participating with putting cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Well, we're getting a tremendous amount of the profits with $300,000 a month in the TIF period returning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Okay, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| My only final point is, Mr. Pavlis, if it saves money, I'd be happy to drive your groceries to your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| and we won't have to do this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| I'd like to start off and thank the developers for addressing this challenging property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| I'd like to thank the administration for working with the business community extremely hard on these challenging projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3876)|
| 1:04:46| to grow the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| And to me, it just comes down to I just we have a limited amount of taxpayer dollar, of rainy day funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| and I just don't think a Walmart and a Publix in the middle of UT's property should be our priority with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3898)|
| 1:05:08| Dr. Lyons spoke at length and said a lot of things I think are good arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| and that I agreed with back when we voted on the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| But I think a key thing when we're talking about this to really realize is the city, they were asked for $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| The city only recommended $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| So if they thought it was so great and so important that this thing get done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| and this brownfield be developed and we get a Publix there and we get a Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| and we get the jobs that come with working at those stores, why isn't it for $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| I talked with Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I asked him, if we deny this, is this deal dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| He said, no, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| It does decrease the chances it would go forward, but, you know, we have a lot in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| and we would try to find another way to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| I said, if we approve this, is it guaranteed to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| He said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| We still have a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| So, you know, we're just sort of a small piece in the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| I think another key aspect, you know, it's just enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| You know, they can't get more money from Walmart and Publix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| Walmart has revenues of $419 billion a year, and Walmart said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| You know, I think the city, eventually we have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| And we gave the largest TIF in the history of Knox County to this development, $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| And it's not just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| It's the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| So the real increase in property tax, we're not going to see for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| A lot of times in these type of strip center developments, that's the entire length of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| So that money, as Councilman De La Vope said, that was for the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| That was for the brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| That represents over 15% of the total projected cost of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| I think that shows, I think the size of that TIF shows how committed we are to making that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| to developing that property and working with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| In terms of some of the other arguments, return on investment, you know, none of us are professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| To me, there's a limited amount of grocery dollars and, you know, dollars in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| It doesn't grow the sales tax base tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| The property tax, I went over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| It's going to be low for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| And looking at the sales tax issue, something that's important to me is that we act like this grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| there's no grocery stores near it, and there's no grocery stores within a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| But I Google mapped it, and within 1.6 miles of this location is a food city in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| And if you're coming down Alcoa Highway, it's just one more exit, and you can stop at that food city in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| And to me, this, and I've talked with some people at Food City, and they say that store is not profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| It is growing, but a big part of their marketing is letting people know how close it is to Fort Sanders and the UT area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4101)|
| 1:08:31| And to me, I think it would be a big, I mean, it's one step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| We'd have a Publix on UT's campus, but it would be a big step back to have an empty box in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| That's an important neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| It's a struggling neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| It's not UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| It's not stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| I mean, it's a challenging area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| To me, it's very important that that food city is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| So I think we should think about that when we get involved in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| And last, in terms of return on investment, to me, it's just not the role of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| I mean, just to get involved in projects because it's going to increase tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| But if that's the case, then we should be involved in a lot more developments because there's a lot of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| that add to the tax base that are through sales tax or property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| You know, to me, the worst thing, I guess, that could happen is if this project fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| if we don't approve this million and a half, the project might not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| To me, that's not the worst thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| I mean, we'd have the million and a half in the rainy day fund for other capital projects or the rainy day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| the rising cost we've gone over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| And this project has been compared to Market Square and the 100 Block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| I think those analogies are way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| There are no public roads on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| The redevelopments in Market Square and the 100 Block, that was all public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| None of the property owners in that area would consider redoing Market Square or redoing the 100 Block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| Those were maintained by the city, and that was, to me, that makes completely sense to do that type of capital infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| To me, this is more analogous to a developer developing a farm with a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| and they need a road, and we're supplying that road to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| So, you know, that's – and to go back, we've invested in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4229)|
| 1:10:41| We're getting ready to invest $13 million in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| So we can't say we're not doing enough for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| We're doing $13 million in Cumberland Avenue, a $10 million TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| I mean, how much more do we have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Now a million and a half out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| To me, it's just enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| We need to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| This is – it's just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| And to me, we're also setting a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| As far as I know, there's never been another TIF or pilot which has received a TIF or pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| then their financing didn't come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| and then came back and received a grant for infrastructure, a cash grant for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| I think this is a very dangerous precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| We talked about the message to the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I can tell you the development committee is – the development community is paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| and we start handing out grants like this, they're going to come asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| And we give – TIFs have been huge in redeveloping downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| They're a tremendous tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I think that's the correct tool for this type of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| We just recently passed a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| I would not like the gentlemen, the Johnsons, to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| well, you know, our bank finance didn't work out, so we need some cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Yes, I want that Arby's building to go, but I don't want them coming back asking for cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| And that's the precedent we're setting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| I don't think it's the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| It sounds like it's going forward, and I certainly respect the decisions of my colleagues on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| I think the key thing for us moving forward, if this is approved, is what are our criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| What separates this from all these other projects that we feel need our – you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| like historic buildings, brownfields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| What's our criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| How can we explain it to the public and to developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| So those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| I wanted to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| The rainy day fund or the fund balance has been mentioned several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| What is the total now of the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| I can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Mr. York will come down and address your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| You can tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| And while he's coming, the one and a half million, will that be in the form of a loan, a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| or how is that structured up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| You can tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| We don't have the final numbers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| but we're estimating that the general fund balance at the end of June 30th of 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| will be somewhere on the order of $59 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| The unassigned fund balance, I think, will be somewhere on the order of $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| And hopefully that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| This will not be in the form of a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| This is money that will be used to go towards infrastructure development in terms of roads and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| Well, while I have the mic, I'm going to say I think the pros outweigh the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| I'm going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| I've had a couple of e-mails against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| I've had at least two people today speak to me, and they're not for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| But I think with the Cumberland Avenue streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| this project is going to be good for the entire city, and I'm planning to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4463)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Bob, you started to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| I think one thing that we need to understand, and I think maybe Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| that one of the points that Marshall did make is that we do need to be cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| and careful in terms of how we do assist developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| But I think the point that you made should be considered highly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| which is the fact that the properties that we have left in the city are difficult properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| We have brownfields, just as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| We have old buildings and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| And I think that we need to be sure to let the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and the development community know that we want those areas developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| And we want to turn properties that are just barely paying for themselves into funds that we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| And so I think that point really ought to be considered pretty carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| that what we're trying to do is we are trying to partner with the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| but at the same time, as you said, what we're doing is we're helping with the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| the roads, the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| And again, we're not going to be spending this money unless this project goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| and it will be at the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| But again, I want my colleagues to really think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| that one of the things that we're doing is that we are trying to let the folks know that these difficult sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| and I know along 275 we've got some real challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| And I think that we're going to have to look at how we are going to develop these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| And at the same time, I think that maybe we do need to consider some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and how we're going to move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| So I just want to make sure that we understand that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Because we divided the question, we're going to look for a motion and a second again, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4581)|
| 1:16:30| We already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| We are now thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| That was a really great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I appreciate sticking with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| That is Vinny Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| Mr. Anastasio, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Please state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Vinny Anastasio, 201 Locust Street, apartment 1011, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I want to thank you, city council, for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| When is the sidewalk on Wall Avenue going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| And why wasn't Wall Avenue, the street, done because of the fact next to the parking garage on Wall Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| there's some holes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| They patched them up a little bit, but they weren't done really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| And then also, why wasn't the Broadway bridge, the sidewalk on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| why wasn't that considered $1.3 million for the sidewalks because of the fact that I go down there all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| on the bridge on Broadway, and the holes in there are so big it's not funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| If you go past where Jackson Avenue is and you go straight down, the holes are huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| I mean, they're pretty big size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Also, unfair this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| I had problems with it on the reduced fares and also the concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Fact one, I was told I had to pay a mission just to get tickets for the Night Ranger show, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| and I told them all I was going to do was get the tickets and I was going to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I felt harassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| I felt it was unprofessional, and also it was uncalled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| Fact two, on the reduced fares, why did it not go through until September 2nd or 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| so people could get tickets early for the shows instead of going online, all right, to, you know, get the tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4721)|
| 1:18:52| because it saved people the aggravation of going online to get tickets for shows, you know, at the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4732)|
| 1:19:02| But the shows were great at the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| I mean, I really enjoyed the fair this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| That's the only problem I had with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| And also on the Walmart thing, I agree with what Mr. Falopoffi said and Mr. Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4751)|
| 1:19:21| The Walmart project, it should be in the future, but you also have to understand the traffic down there would be tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4761)|
| 1:19:32| I mean, and also the one with Carmelton Avenue, there's room flowing around that you all are going to widen Carmelton Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| I'm against that because you have football games, and if you have one lane, you've got traffic coming up from Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| Neyland Drive, you've got traffic coming down from Kingston Pike, that's going to cause a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| So I'm definitely against widening Carmelton Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| But I'm all for, you know, the sidewalks and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| And that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| And I hope this council really thinks about, you know, redeveloping the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| because I'm all for redeveloping, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| But the thing of it is, as a citizen and taxpayer, I'm concerned about that the city is not going to get burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| What I mean by being burned is where the money that you put into these development projects is going to be used for it and not wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4829)|
| 1:20:39| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| And your specific questions about sidewalks and roads, turn to your right and talk with Mr. Hagerman right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| He can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Ms. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121002?start=4853)|
