| 0:05:04| And I want to emphasize my commitment to implementing the recommendations it contains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| And to that end, my team is already engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=309)|

| 0:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I would just like somebody to speak to the details of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Ms. Gill, I think you could give an overview, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| And I also want to acknowledge that Leigh Ann Hilliard with McNabb is here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| so if you have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| But one of the really impactful processes that was led in 2015 that allowed the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| to identify the need for the BHUC and other strategies that have been successful in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| was a sequential intercept mapping, and it is a multi-jurisdictional effort that brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| together partners for at least a full day, if not a little longer, to talk about places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| where residents come into contact with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| And if you recall from a workshop we had earlier this summer about co-response, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| innovations that the group that leads this intercept mapping exercise identified and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| that is now part of industry standard is Intercept Zero, which is actually trying to reach people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| before they have a contact with the traditional criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| And it is out of that Intercept Zero thinking that we see models like co-response emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| So the recommendation that we brought to Council as part of that workshop was to redo that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| sequential intercept mapping exercise with an intentional effort to identify and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| hone in on that Intercept Zero type of framing and identifying where there are gaps and strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| in our existing system and to bridge the gap specifically with some of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| we had at that workshop, recognizing that conversations around alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| really fall into that spectrum and that intercept pathway, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| And so that will be one of the focus areas that this mapping exercise will look at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| consider in conjunction with not just KPD but also partners at, we hope they will engage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| but the Sheriff's Department, the courts, the Family Justice Center, a variety of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| partners in the community, and this is where Ms. Hilliard can speak to how that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| would play out if you'd like to learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I would love to hear who the partners are because I've gotten some phone calls about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| groups who aren't feeling included in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| And Ms. Hilliard, as you're coming up to the podium, I'll note for Council that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| at the very early planning stages, so we are not yet at the point where invitations have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| been sent, so no one has missed an invite, but I'll turn it over to Ms. Hilliard to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| that process more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| So the company we want to partner with to provide this sequential intercept mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| is Policy Research Incorporated, and in 2015, that was the organization and company that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| worked with SAMHSA to do our community's SIM VIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And so we thought that that's very important to engage with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| They believe that we need about a minimum of a three-month process in order to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| a successful SIM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| And so part of that process is identifying a planning group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| That group has not been identified yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So until we want to, you know, have a contract with them and move forward, the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| will be to identify a small planning group that then is really tasked with doing a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| This small group will identify as much data as we can send to this organization so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| they know kind of the picture of our community as it has changed since 2015, as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| resources that have been added or lost since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| And in addition to that, they will identify who are all the individuals in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| that we want to invite into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| We want to be as inclusive as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I mean, when you really want to get a good outcome, you need to provide invitations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| anybody that has a family member, an individual, a law enforcement organization, a provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| community stakeholders that will have an influence in the process and have their thoughts incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| into that SIM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So that's what this planning group will identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| And how is it that Helen Ross McNabb has the expertise to be the one pulling this together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| I don't think that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| So I think that is the point of trying to hire another company that is separate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| our organization and actually separate from this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| So Policy Research Incorporated is from New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| They come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| All our role is is to be a local host for them and provide them and, you know, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| sure that individuals get an invitation, making sure that we have a facility or a place identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| that it can happen, and provide the refreshments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| And then just really making sure that the planning group meets all those timeframes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| so that this other organization can come in and perform the SIMs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| And then the other, this Policy Research Incorporated provides all the materials back to us in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| comprehensive report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| So if there are groups who are feeling worried that they're not going to be asked to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| can I have them contact, who should they contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Well, so I would say that if they feel like they haven't been part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| yet, I would agree with the Deputy Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| There's really been nothing other than us having a conversation with this research company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| to see if they are willing to contract with us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And then I think if any organization feels like they want to be a part of this, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| I just need to know their contact information so that we can make sure they're part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| And then if we need to reach out personally to make people feel more invited and included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| just you can let me know and we'll make sure we reach out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=1579)|

| 0:42:02| we're able to help at least six clients per week with deposits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| Our goal is to make sure that we have our clients in affordable, permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| So we are able to work with our clients, get involved in case management, create an action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| plan so that we can help individuals stabilize themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| So we provide and give referrals for roundabout services so that we can give each client personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2546)|
| 0:42:35| efficient help so when they leave, all their needs have been addressed and or we've referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2555)|

| 0:42:48| We've been able to make many partnerships with many agencies in Knox County, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| have done a wonderful job in referring clients that are in need that otherwise wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| able to secure housing because they just don't have the funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| So I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2584)|

| 0:43:25| So I just wanted to say on behalf of Connect Ministries to thank you, the city and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| council for previously giving us the $200,000, which was supposed to be an 18-month contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| And as you can see, within six months, we've served not only the 60 we were supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| serve in direct services, but 100 case management, we've served 162 in six months for 18-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So the money is very much necessary and needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| And so Connect Ministries, our staff, and our Executive Director, Ms. White, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| we truly thank you because Connect Ministries has always been known to have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| to make rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| And so you're just helping us make rain a little bit more, a little bit longer, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| give people hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| What a better time to offer hope to people during this Advent season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| And we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| That concludes the public speaker sign-up to see on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| So Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I just wanted to take a moment to say to Connect Ministries, who's been around for a very long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2666)|
| 0:44:34| time, started at Greater Warner Church with Sister Kira Wyatt and Sister Cynthia Finch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| and the other staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And I have had the privilege to be able to volunteer with them over the years and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| firsthand the work that they've done over the years and how they have come out of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| own pockets to put people in housing and doing case management for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| And so I think most nonprofits in the room that are in this lane or in any lane understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| this plight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| But this is a smaller nonprofit that started out with just two or three people working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| And when they say boots on the ground, they actually mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| They're out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| They're connecting with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| They are helping people who are coming out of incarceration, people who are coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| of homelessness, who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I've seen them help people get their medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And there's a health care component through New Directions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| And so it's a good day when we finally start seeing these nonprofits being able to compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| and get grants and funding to help do the work and not have to come out of their own pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| And so I just want to commend you, Ms. Wyatt, Ms. Finch, and your other staff members for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| And God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2752)|

| 0:48:50| a question about whether this is something new or an improvement on something that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2935)|

| 0:49:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| So basically what we're looking at here is an increased opportunity to have lateral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| transfers within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2956)|

| 0:49:26| So, Chief Thomas, can you just clarify, when we hire lateral transfers and have them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| a separate academy, do they do a different training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Is it somehow abbreviated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| So, yes, they do do an abbreviated training right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| It's between seven and eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| It's very dependent on what training they have had at their previous position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| That has to be approved through the Tennessee Post so that they have all the training required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| in Tennessee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| So some have a little more, some have a little less, so it averages about seven to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Following that, they do go through the same field training officer program that a recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| a normal recruit, would go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| So it's still an extensive field training officer program that lasts about four and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| a half, five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Which is that six months of the field training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| Yeah, with the 12-hour shifts, yes, ma'am, it's closer to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 17, Article 6, Division 1, Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| 17-262 to lower the unposted speed limit on city roadways from five miles per hour, excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| me, by five miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| There's a person signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Dr. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| You may get tired of seeing me up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| BikeWalk Knoxville understands that speed is perhaps the most important factor in whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| a collision results in a serious injury or fatality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| For this reason, we are extremely supportive of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Lowering speed limits makes our streets safer, especially for vulnerable road users such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| as pedestrians, cyclists, children, disabled, elderly, and people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| According to a research from AAA Foundation, Foundation for Traffic Safety, a person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| about 70% more likely to be killed if they're struck by a vehicle traveling at 30 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| an hour versus 25 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Lowering speeds is a vital step in achieving the traffic safety goals set forth in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| recent Vision Zero resolution passed by the city last month, and we applaud any movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| towards making our streets safer for all transportation users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| We would also encourage that we have public education about the new speed limit, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| we'll need targeted enforcement to help raise awareness for this important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you, Dr. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I think Councilmember Ryder, Vice Mayor McKenzie, and then Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Yeah, so my question is, what efforts will we be using to support enforcement and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| to make sure that the public is aware that the change has been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Because these are unposted, speed limits in unposted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Kind of the number one complaint in most neighborhoods is speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| It makes a lot of people feel unsafe to go out and walk or even pick up their mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| So this is, I mean, it's really important to transit on a bike or pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| So what efforts will we be able to make for enforcement and education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Well, that's a good question, Councilmember Ryder, and I'll have to just preface this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| by saying this is another tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| It's not going to solve all our problems automatically and won't make everybody obey the new speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| But I'll, Dr., Director Cannon, if you could share with us a little bit of engineering's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| approach to this, and then if Chief Thomas has anything she wants to add about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Yes, Mayor, and if you saw my transcript, it definitely wouldn't equal a doctor's, I'll promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you, Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Throughout the city, as people come in, there will be signs that say what the speed limit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| unless posted otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Those signs will be corrected, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Number two is we'll work with our communications staff to make sure that the word gets out and gets out clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| That's right, education is an important component of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| But the most important component is the behavior, and we'll be working with the chief in making sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3233)|
| 0:54:03| as best we can, and we have to recognize what resources they have and that they're limited by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| that where there are issues, and the public has done a remarkable job of letting us know where there are issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| that we will work with KPD to enforce those speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| This is, in my opinion, this is a significant step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| This is one that the mayor charged our department with when I first came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| that safety of the public in all modes of transportation, and quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| each one of you have called me on something at some point in time related to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| I consider this, and it's always been going to the speed humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| That's where everything has defaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| This gives us, the mayor said it best, this gives us another tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| So it's a long-winded answer, my apology, but this is a good step, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| And before I turn my life, I just want to point out, like, so in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| when the Neighborhood Traffic Calming came back, which is a partnership with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| and the Office of Neighborhoods, which I believe has a different name now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Sorry, I'm old-fashioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Office of Neighborhood Empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Neighborhood Empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Anyway, in the past, they had worked on signs with the sloth on it that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Please Slow Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| So those are scattered throughout yards throughout the city where they were doled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| at the annual neighborhoods conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| So I don't know if, you know, working with the Office of Neighborhood Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| and Debbie Sharp and Neighborhood Advisory Council and some of the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| to kind of get more of those signs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| There have been conversations about getting more larger orders of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| I just think there's going to need to be a big, just like with litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| like we need to educate people not to litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| We also need to educate them to slow the heck down in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| so people can live their lives outside of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| We are planning on having a neighborhood conference in person towards the end of spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| and that can certainly be something we add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| Dr. Lomax, did you have anything you wanted to add about the Office of Neighborhood Empowerment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| I was just going to say that our neighborhood conference will be taking place in person next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| and it will be in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| April the 2nd, I believe, off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| And Chief Thomas, did you want to share the police department's perspective on enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| given resources and staffing constraints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| And I'll echo Harold Cannon's comments, except for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| I know you get a lot of calls, but I think I get more calls for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| You got me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| But, you know, whenever we're trying to affect traffic calming, there are those three issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| education, engineering, and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| It takes all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| As far as education, we have quite a Facebook following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| We have quite a Twitter account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| So we will definitely be putting some public service announcements out on our own KPD page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Another thing that we could look at as far as grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I don't know if you're familiar with Kingston Pipe where we have the flashing sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| I think there's one on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Some of those would definitely be a good thing to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| I don't have the money for that now, but we can apply for some grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| I believe Director Cannon has ordered some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| That is correct, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| They ought to be coming in very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| So those are great educational tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| The other thing we have, you know, as far as enforcement is for almost two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| we have had warning citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| So it's not always a monetary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We can give out a warning as well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| So that's, you know, a few of the tools in our toolbox in working with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| We can hopefully affect some of this bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| So I'm really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| I'm in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| but I'm really concerned about the areas where there's no speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| that we're reducing it and then I get pulled over because maybe I'm doing 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| and now we're saying it's 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| but there's nothing posted that indicates to me that the speed limit is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| So I'm really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So I'd like for us to have some type of comprehensive communication plan, PSAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| I don't know exactly what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Of course, Office of Neighborhoods can help put some stuff out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| but I am very concerned about that because what I don't want to see is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| people getting pulled over even with warnings per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| and I know you guys probably don't have the bandwidth to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| when they don't even know that there's no speed limit at all posted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| So I think this could pose, you know, I think some issues for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| If the speed limit were posted, I think it would be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| but if I'm driving down the street once again, there's no speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| and I'm doing 30, which could be reasonable in a lot of areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| and now it's 25 and I don't know it because it's still not posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| but we've gone ahead and we have implemented this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| So I'm just really concerned and would like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and I know we don't have all those answers today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| but I think before this comes back on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| if we could have some effort or something in writing as a council to see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| communication plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Okay, that's, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| First of all, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| A lot of people don't know what the unposted, if it's unposted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| I thought it was already 25 until this came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| You know, I sort of assumed it was 30 seems fast in a neighborhood to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| especially as someone who walks and bikes a lot, 30 seems scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| And as Dr. Cooley pointed out, the whole reason we're doing this is to help save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| And so I think this is a great opportunity for us to move forward with this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| and use the change as an opportunity to share with the people why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And it's all about safety and protecting people from unnecessary speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| And it's for people who are walkers, people who are strolling with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| people in wheelchairs, people who are biking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| It's people who are walking to the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| It's going to help a lot of people, but it won't work unless we get that information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| So communication strategy is really important, and that's part of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| And I certainly will call on the Bike Walk Knoxville folks and our friends with TPO and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| Like, we're not the only ones who can get the message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| We'll ask our media partners to work on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| There's, I think, a multi-partner approach will be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| So I think that's a good idea, and we'll certainly work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| I don't know if we'll have a finished plan in the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| but we'll certainly flesh that out if it's approved today and in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| And I agree with you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| I don't think that any of our residents would not be in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| I think it's just a matter of they need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Yeah, and how do we push that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| I mean, public safety and neighborhood safety, we all get those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| I don't think there's a council member that's sitting around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| I know the district representatives, we always get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| And so I do think it's something that will be embraced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| but we just need to make sure that people know because I don't want to get calls where people are upset and angry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| even if it's just a warning, getting pulled over, maybe going to work or coming home from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| and they just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| So I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I have a lot of concerns about this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| many of which have already been expressed by my fellow council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| You know, one question I have is when the last time the unposted speed limit was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3710)|
| 1:02:00| Mr. Cannon, do you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| It has been a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Even our staff had to do some digging into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| A long time, more than 30, more than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| That's what I was thinking, that it's been my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| I don't think that this is a change that we should make without a very involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| and engaged public process to inform the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| One compromise perhaps I would like to propose is to make an alternative motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3750)|
| 1:02:41| with the ordinance to take effect July 1st, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3761)|
| 1:02:53| giving the city time to educate the public about the upcoming change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| So I'll make that motion and see if I get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Okay, so can you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| You're making a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Is that what I'm making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| I think it's an amendment, not a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| So I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So can you just repeat what you're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Motion to amend approving the agenda item, having an effective start date of July 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3800)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Motion made to change the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Normally the effective date is basically upon passage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| 17 days from and after passage, unless it says immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| So the motion to amend is that the effective date would be July 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| It's been made by Council Member Parker and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| I think Councilwoman Parker's suggestion for a delayed start is, I don't know if that's the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3845)|
| 1:04:14| but I, too, worry that this sets up a situation where we're going to anger citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| and put KPD in a very bad spot to be pulling people over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| which is one of the most dangerous and confrontational acts they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| is pulling people over because you don't know what you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| When a lot of upsetness, that's not a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| but a lot of anger tends to happen when people are pulled over, especially if they don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| And so my concern is that if there is not a runway to inform people that this is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| we're putting our police department in a bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| we're putting citizens in a bad situation where they're going to read it in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| and then, boom, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| And as for unposted speed limit, I've lived here for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| I guessed it was 35 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| So, I mean, I don't think people really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I do not speed, but I'm just telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| You don't think you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| I didn't think I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| But you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| But I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| And that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| I'm not trying to make light of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| but I do think traffic stops are dangerous and tenuous, emotion-filled police interaction with citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3935)|
| 1:05:49| at a time when we are struggling and trying very hard to improve citizen and police relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3949)|
| 1:05:59| I don't want to do anything that could harm that and put our police in a more difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| And if waiting a few months to implement this so all the media push can be done to let people know it's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| that's why I seconded her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| I'm not tied to when, but I think that's a compromise to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you, Council Member Hugot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| All these lights are on about the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Council Member Testerman, you want to talk about the amendment or the underlying motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| It's the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Let's stick to just the amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| And just in case you're wondering, I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| I think a delay is going to give us an opportunity, just as Council Member Parker and Hugot set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| And it can also be rolled into the working group that when you pass the Vision Zero resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| we're going to be convening a working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| and this can be an item that they help educate and build community support and understanding of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| I just want to say I think it's a good idea to have a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| July 1st sounds like a good time to me to educate the public on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| I think that's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I guess the question I had, just relating to the delay, is, is there any, you know, Director Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4036)|
| 1:07:25| is there any evidence or is there any statistics you could cite to us about what a reduction from 30 miles per hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4045)|
| 1:07:35| unposted to 25 miles per hour unposted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| or is there any data you can give us about what we're talking about there with reduced traffic incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| and anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| I think Dr. Cooley said it best for the AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| I forgot the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| But there is a significant difference in that, and keeping in mind this is only for unposted roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| The next one gives us flexibility on the posted ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| There is a significant difference, and I think her statistics speak well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| Yeah, I think Dr. Cooley cited that 70% more likely to die if there's a collision at 30 miles per hour versus 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4092)|
| 1:08:21| Dr. Cooley, do you want to restate that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| This is data from AAA, Foundation for Traffic Safety, and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4104)|
| 1:08:37| AAA does a lot of good research and has a lot of extensive data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| A person is about 70% more likely to be killed if they're struck by a vehicle traveling at 30 miles per hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| versus 25 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| And this has also been reported by the federal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| The National Highway Safety Traffic Administration has lots of data on how speeding is geometric as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| as the speed goes up, it's not a slow line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| It's a very steep line as far as the risk of fatality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| And so even lowering by five miles per hour can make a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| I'm sorry, I'll just add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| As the neighborhoods, I think all of you know, the neighborhoods, more and more of the neighborhoods are requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| 25 mile per hour speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I think everyone was surprised, including myself, that that was something that had to be requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| that it wasn't, you know, that 30 miles per hour is the standard or has been forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4181)|
| 1:09:49| And that these neighborhoods that have 25 miles per hour, and Mr. Canning, you can correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| but they have to request to lower that speed limit within their neighborhoods to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you, Dr. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Oh, I was just going to say, I always assumed it was 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| So this was educational to me that we're moving from 30 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| But I'll support the motion to give us some more time for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Okay, the motion to amend the effective date to July 1st, 2022 is what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Council Member Ryder and Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you want to discuss the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| I agree with my colleague's sentiments, and I understand, which is why my question straight out of the gates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| I was the first one to speak after the motion was made, or the original motion was made, about what's the enforcement plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| What's the education plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Because it's really important, and we are setting ourselves up for a problem if we don't have an education plan, a media plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4241)|
| 1:10:51| a communication plan, a blitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I mean, it's going to take a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| And so that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| I agree with what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| I also want to say that we have an enforcement problem with the current speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| The conversation I have with my constituents who are begging for slower speeds in their neighborhood at the current limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| is that we just cannot put police on every street in every neighborhood at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| It's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And so, for example, Chief Thomas can speak to it, but you guys will do what you call traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| which is you put an officer for, what is it, four hours or two-hour shifts as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| which has become increasingly more and more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And in my experience, in my neighborhood in the past, the only times cars slowed down was when they saw that police car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| and as soon as that four-hour shift was over and the car left, the people were speeding again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| So I actually asked our officer that was out there, I was like, hey, can you just park your car here and drive my Volkswagen van home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| Because that seems to be what's doing the trick is having that car parked out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| So we have an ongoing problem that's predated me being on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| It's why, you know, David Massey in the then Office of Neighborhoods was working so hard with neighborhoods to slow down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| People get hit by cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| People's pets get hit by cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| People's children get hit by cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| That's where I hesitate at not going ahead and saying we could delay the speed limit because the data is real for every mile an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4349)|
| 1:12:39| for every five mile an hour someone's speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| It lends to permanent damage and fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| And I don't have enough fingers to count all of my friends that have died by being hit by cars on bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4366)|
| 1:12:55| And I'm not going to sit here and cry and tell you about all my friends that have been hit by cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| One of them, the most recent, was a guy named Frank who rode his bike to work every day in Indianapolis in Broad Ripple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| if anybody's been to Broad Ripple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Broad Ripple is slow-moving traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| It's a little village urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| And Frank was going to work, and he got hit by a car right there in Broad Ripple, and he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| And I just get exhausted of hearing when my friend's getting killed by cars hitting them because they're driving too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| And I realize people don't want to be pulled over, and I realize our police don't want to be in these adversarial situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| We've been begging for years, the neighborhoods have, for enforcement, not because the police don't want to give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| It's just that you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| We've been begging for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| So, I mean, I have a hard time voting for the postponement because you're basically saying it's okay if we have people hit by cars at higher speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4421)|
| 1:13:55| I just see that as a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| That's part of my struggle with that is postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| But, again, we're not doing ourselves a favor by passing this and having a not solid, a rock-solid plan for education and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4441)|
| 1:14:10| So, it's a problem that we just haven't gotten a handle on for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I'm going to go over to Councilmember Testerman on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| Well, I mean, I don't disagree with some type of strategic communication rollout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| You know, is it seven months or is it 90 days or whatever the case may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| I just want to expand on what Director Cannon had mentioned and commend engineering for being creative and coming up because we all know each of us have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4476)|
| 1:14:49| I mean, first of all, the speed limit is largely, you know, within neighborhoods, in and around neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| And I know I feel certain each of us have requested speed humps in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| I know that I have, and we know how backlogged it is, and we know how costly it is and how long it takes to actually implement the speed humps within these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4502)|
| 1:15:14| So, to be able to come up with at least a solution that could mitigate the speed humps, I think, is, you know, again, creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4514)|
| 1:15:29| And I think it's a really great solution, again, an extra tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| So, I kind of go back to the speed humps, the expenditure, the backlog of how long it takes to make those happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| And, you know, is this a great solution for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| So, and I do, I am in favor of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| I don't think that, you know, us changing the speed limit, if a person is a speeder, they're going to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4554)|
| 1:16:03| And so I don't think it's necessarily going to mitigate traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| I think that would be great if it did, but I don't think that that's realistic because there are some people who are just going to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| That's just a habit of speeding or not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| I do see this as an opportunity, as I've listened to my colleagues speak, to even make this a safety campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| to educate our residents about Vision Zero, about, you know, these statistics, because the average person doesn't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| I wasn't aware of these statistics until we started having these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| And so I think this is a great opportunity for us to not only educate about the change in the speed limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| but also a safety campaign that I think the majority of our residents, I know our neighborhoods would embrace and get behind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| So, and I do think that that would take a little bit of time to be able to roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| I'm committed to, you know, leading that charge in my district and wherever else is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I have a question for, I think, an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| So when the legislature, this reminds me of when the legislature said you could not use your cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4633)|
| 1:17:22| You had to use hands-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| They passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| I think it took effect, but there was a period in which you would only get warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| You would not get, so I guess I'm reaching for some sort of compromise here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| where I'm hearing the stuff about wanting it to be in effect, but we're trying to, I just ask the question, is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4659)|
| 1:17:51| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Anything's possible with five votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| I would say that it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Council Members, just one path forward is, you know, this effective date could be adopted, and then if Division Zero Working Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4681)|
| 1:18:11| the whole reason we're convening this working group is for some people with some expertise to help advise us on how to make these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| whether it's reducing speed limits or doing more bulb outs and parking on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| There's, like, many different ways to slow people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Some of them are real expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Some of them are less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| They all require some change in different parts of town and, you know, require different strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| So, you know, if the July 1st date is the effective date and then the Division Zero Working Group comes up with some great strategies that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4720)|
| 1:18:51| we're ready to go April 1st, you know, they can come back and we can say we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Anyhow, that's just something, words to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| First of all, I completely support lowering the speed limit to 25 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| in line with some of Vice Mayor McKenzie's comments about the proliferation, I guess, of speeding and habits that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4749)|
| 1:19:20| And really what we're combating more than anything else is just the culture of speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| And we can try to enforce it with police or traffic signs, et cetera, even speed bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| But that's so ingrained in our culture that that's, along with this, is what we really need to attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| And I think that a delay might give us an opportunity, really, to highlight this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| And during that period, you know, it is fair to people to give them some kind of fair warning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| especially if they've got a habit all their life of speeding, which a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| But to me, just as important, or maybe even more important than lowering the speed limit as a safety campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4801)|
| 1:20:10| is we really need to double down on people and try to change their behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| And it's a bit like littering, a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| I mean, we can't enforce littering, anti-littering laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| We can do a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| There's a fine, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| But more important to combat littering is just a real public campaign and changing what's acceptable in a society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4828)|
| 1:20:38| And fortunately, speeding has become somewhat acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| I did a little experiment not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I got out on the interstate and got in the left-hand lane and went as fast as the law allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| which is 70 miles an hour, and like a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| And traffic was backed up and people were whipping around the right of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| and flipping me off and honking their horns and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And it was like I was the lawbreaker because I was only going the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| But I say that somewhat with a bit of levity, but it's still true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| We've got kind of this idea among society where speeding is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| And so along with lowering the speed limit, I really would like to see us make a push for public safety along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4883)|
| 1:21:37| And I don't think a delay is going to be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| I think it might actually make people less resentful about it, especially if they don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| And to me, whether it's July 1st or when it is, that's a little bit subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| But along with the mayor's suggestion, if we can convene a workshop or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| I don't feel like there's been enough warning that we could put it, maybe move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| That's just the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| But I will be in favor of delaying this until we can have this discussion with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| and really give people notice of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Yeah, just want to add, I agree with a lot of the sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| I think we all want folks to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| Because I think a proper 30-year law change, I think it's helpful to have a few months of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| So we can piggyback safety on that and make a bigger deal of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| So I think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| And I also want to just add that the left lane is only for passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4961)|
| 1:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Council Member Ryder, on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Can I ask, so the amendment is about postponing it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| No, it's just to make it an effective date, July 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| Right, the amendment is about not postponing, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| To change the effective date out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Tied to that rationale, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| So whatever we vote on tonight, we will vote on again because there's a second reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| So, Chief Thomas, I have a question that you may not be able to answer fully tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| And I wonder if maybe next time on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| we could have some data on how often people get pulled over in these unmarked areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| Like, how many tickets are issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Are they issued for 10-mile-an-hour over, 5-mile-an-hour over, 20-mile-an-hour over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| Like, what the overages are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Because I really just don't feel that people are going 30 in a 25 zone and getting pulled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| It's just not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Because you know what they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| They're driving 40 and 50 and 60 and still not getting pulled over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| because those are the calls that we're getting, and we see it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| I don't know where they're getting pulled over, but it doesn't seem to be in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| So I guess the data, I need to have just a location would probably help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| because there are so many unmarked streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I mean, I could look up whatever location you like, but just in general, just pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Maybe I'll follow up with you to ask how you're able to pull data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| I guess if you're only able to pull it by street versus miles-an-hour over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| You know, I'd have to check with our crime analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Any other questions on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| All those in favor of making this effective date July 1, 2022, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Are there any further questions or discussion on this motion as amended on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| The amended motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code Chapter 17, Article 6, Division 1, Section 17-263| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| to eliminate the required minimum speed limit on city roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Motion moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Do we need to amend this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| It's a different ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| This is a minimum speed limit, meaning we won't ticket you for going too slow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| Mr. Swanson, is there any reason to change the effective date of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| I don't really see a reason to change the effective date on that, but it's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| within council's prerogative to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| I think if people want to start driving too slow today, they can go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| I don't think we have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| 12D is an ordinance to amend Chapters 16, 17, and 20 of the Knox City Code in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| to establish a permit and associated regulations for shareable personal micro-mobility vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| and systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| I'll second for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Looks like there's a few items for discussion, and there's also some people signed up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| speak on this, so let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Okay, first person signed up to speak in favor of this item is Chris Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| If you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Chris Cherry, 1305 Beacon Hill Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| First of all, thank you for the approval of the lower speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| As somebody who's going to ride my bike home in a few minutes, I appreciate the 25-mile-per-hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| speed limit in my neighborhood that we had to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| And so doing it to protect me and my friends and my family is very important and important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| to me, so that's a different point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| So on scooters, in my professional life, I conduct research on scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5236)|
| 1:27:25| I'm a professor whose kind of core area of research is micromobility, bike safety, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5245)|
| 1:27:33| And so I'm urging you to approve the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| There's a lot of issues, of course, with scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| They're somewhat polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| They're a new thing that's easy to point a finger at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| But in the work that I've done, the committees I've led, national committees on this sort of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| we've found that, in general, they're a positive, supportive mode of transportation that supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5273)|
| 1:28:02| at least the goals and the policies of the city, sustainability, safety, multimodality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5282)|
| 1:28:10| And so we could talk a lot about the many ins and outs of scooter policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| I'd love to talk about that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| But overall, what we've found is that people take scooters to go places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| There's a lot of anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| There's a lot of speculation that people take scooters to joyride and have fun and jump curbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| and ride the wrong way into traffic and goof around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| But, in fact, at least two-thirds, three-quarters of trips that we've looked at are accessing destinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| that are providing mobility and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| We've done a lot of work with the data in Nashville to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| So this isn't just a L.A. or New York thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| And so that's one of the main benefits, is this is just another, to use the words we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| tool in the toolbox to provide multimodal options for people to move around our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| We found some of that with the data that we've looked at in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| We've seen a lot of traffic between downtown and the Fort and the Fort and campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| They're not just going around in blocks and irritating people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| On the sustainability front, we've also seen that scooters can contribute to more sustainable transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| insofar as they reduce car trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| And city after city after city that has done this work has shown that they grab from everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| but they grab about a third or more from car trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| So you think about reducing traffic and reducing traffic in our downtown area and our congested areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| and scooters contribute to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| And finally, the big one, safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| There's been a lot of big media articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Scooters suffer a safety problem like every transportation mode that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| The sensational media articles that we've seen have focused on fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| Those fatalities, four out of five of those fatalities are when a scooter driver is run over by a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| And so those are the sorts of things that we need to think about when we think about the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| and we need to think about scooters as a vulnerable road user like a pedestrian or a bicyclist or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| And, again, we can talk all about the ins and outs of scooter policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| but in reality they contribute to the things that we already care about as a city, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| including multimodality, bike infrastructure, getting people out of their cars, especially in the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| So with that, I urge you to support this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| and allow the city to essentially manage this in a useful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Dr. Caroline Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| Dr. Cooley, if you could come to the podium again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| And BikeWalk Knoxville advocates for all forms of micromobility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| as well as advocating for safe and convenient infrastructure for all modes of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| We would like to see responsible expansion of the shared e-scooter programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| as well as the return of a bike share that includes e-bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| so that we can actually get some people who do not have the physical capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| to ride up from volunteer from the waterfront, they can't get back up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5505)|
| 1:31:55| So why would they go down there to visit if they can't get back up the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| So we really would like to see some e-bikes and part of a bike share that returns to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| And e-bikes are really quite safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| We also support the use of both the e-scooters and e-bikes on our city greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| which is included in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| It has not previously been allowed, but the scooters could be used on greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| The maximum speed of these scooters and bikes is 15 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| I assure you there are plenty of bicyclists that exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| or go 15 or more miles an hour on the greenway already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| And if you would think about it, the only way they can go westbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| if they can't go on the greenway is to actually ride on Kingston Pike or on Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| which is really unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| And so the greenways are really important to allow people to get where they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| We support that this ordinance has restrictions on drop-off areas on the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| so that people will get them back to an appropriate place so they won't be as much clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| So we support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| And Bike Walk Knoxville supports this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| That concludes people signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Council Member Fugett, I think your light was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Then Council Member Ryder and Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| So I just have to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I understand the previous council adopted this pilot program in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| I wasn't on council then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| And so I'd first of all like a little background about why we even have scooters here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| because what I will tell you, I mean, I'm not saying I'm opposed to all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| but people don't walk up to me and tell me how much they love scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| What I hear is people who hate them and that they don't, they clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| People, you know, I don't doubt that people are hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| but I hear complaints about people not obeying traffic laws, not doing all these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| So, again, I just kind of, because one of the questions that I get asked is why do we even have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| Why did we even let them be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| And the response I've heard is because they were coming anyway and we need to regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| So I just like Deputy Mayor Gill, whatever your, it's late, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5666)|
| 1:34:37| My time zone is still over the Atlantic Ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| So if you could explain to me and for everybody who may not have been paying attention two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| when this pilot started, why we even got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| because most of what you hear in the community is not a love for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Yep, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Thank you, Councilwoman Fugate, and I think hopefully what I'll go over here in terms of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| and some of the key points will help answer and address some of the questions that you've raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| as well as that others may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| we are happy to talk about as many of the details in this as Council would desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| So for those of you who were on Council when we began this journey together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| you will recall that we started talking about this in late 2018 and early 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| as our peer cities, both in the state as well as beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| were surprised and caught off guard to see scooters popping up on their streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| Knoxville got ahead of that on two folds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| One is that we created that moratorium that said you can't come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| unless we allow you explicitly through our pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| But we also did create that pilot program, and to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| the thinking of the administration at that time that several members of Council heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| was that we wanted to be a city that was seen as open-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| to some of these new technologies that were being introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| We didn't want to close the gate entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We wanted to say let's be studious, let's be methodical and intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| about understanding the implications of this new device on our roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| We had already done a bike share program that was fairly well-received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| and people appreciated the Pace bikes, if you recall those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| and we saw this as potentially an additional emerging business opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| that we wanted to be able to potentially accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| but recognizing that we needed to put some constraints on that from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| We have had that pilot program now for nearly three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| It launched in February of 2019, and so we have been managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| and monitoring that program collaboratively with an internal team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| as well as working closely with the vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| which even just in the three years we have seen dramatic evolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| in the technology and the level of detail that the vendors are able to both see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| in real time but then also manage for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| And so our pilot has been able to evolve with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| The moratorium that you all have discussed in the past is ending December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| and so what we bring to you tonight is our proposal for a way that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| can confirm essentially a path forward for these scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| So as Dr. Cherry alluded to, and I'll echo some of these comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| from an administrative perspective, we see enough of a benefit from these scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| that we are not recommending a ban on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| So our path forward that we're bringing to you is to continue to allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| through a permit program that manages for some of those nuisances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and the issues that have been articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| I'll talk through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I think you've heard them, but I want to just hit some, again, from our perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| You know, there's been 130,000 rides in the calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| so these are very well utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| And to Dr. Cherry's point, we appreciate the research that's been done locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| to begin to help us understand that the rides that we're seeing are not purely joy rides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| that they really are being used for transportation purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| We also recognize, again, that there's an element of getting people out of their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| and cultivating a culture where you are able to move across our city with or without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| And this is, again, one more tool that creates that culture where non-car drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| can also utilize our roadways safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| I want to also address the e-bike opportunity that we're very excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| And so, again, we see increasing opportunity for scooter programs to support that bike access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| that many of you have supported as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| And I'll point you towards specifically a clause in the ordinance that will require permittees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| if they offer the service elsewhere, that if they want to be permitted in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| they need to provide a minimum of 50 bikes or e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| So, again, I'll caveat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| I can get into these details, but we intentionally built that in there specifically to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| our interest as an administration, but also the interest that we've heard from stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| in bringing those bikes back because they were so popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| But I think the other key element here is that while we see these benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| we really understand that the costs cannot outweigh those benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| and that the nuisances that have been identified both through our pilot as well as through surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| and the anecdotal experience that we've said, we have to manage this in such a way that those nuisances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| don't outweigh the potential benefits that these bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| And so, again, I'm prepared to walk through some of those places where we've outlined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| I don't want to get ahead of council, but if you'll indulge me, what I'll do is hit some of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| and how the ordinance proactively addresses them, if that feels comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| I see enough heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| The first that I want to address is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| So there is an inherent risk to riding a scooter much as there is to riding a bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| and so our approach has been to mitigate that through several provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| So the first that you'll see in the administrative rules is that you can only operate a scooter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| between 7 and 11 p.m., so there's an inherent, like, they're going to go to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| and you should too at 11 p.m., so I describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| And the other distinction, and this is somewhat of a best practice that we're glad we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| from the beginning that other cities have not, is that scooters are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| and will continue to be limited from some of our busiest roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| So if you think about Henley Street, you cannot ride a scooter on Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| You cannot ride a scooter onto the onramp of an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| which some cities have had unfortunate incidences of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| You won't be able to ride them, for example, on James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| or even in busy pedestrian areas like Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| So that has been the technology that we've constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| and that will continue to be a constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| A little bit of data, we can talk about this, but I was asked this question earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| We have had five reported scooter injuries, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| five reported scooter incidents with injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| and that's across an estimated 30,000 rides, or excuse me, 300,000 rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| So again, an order of magnitude there that makes it very comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| to some of the other non-car means, and I would argue even car means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| of getting around our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| And again, we can talk more about that, and I think Dr. Cherry has graciously offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| to provide some of that national perspective if you desire it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Second, parking and clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| This is one of the things we hear the most about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| and has been a major point of frustration and feedback early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| and so this is a place where we really spent a lot of time thinking through carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Just to be very clear, it is not acceptable for a scooter to block a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| We're talking about mobility, and when we think about mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| sidewalks are accessible to everyone, and both from an ADA perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| as well as just from a good practice, if these are blocking a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| that's not achieving those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| We also recognize from a clutter perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| that cluttering of downtown that we're very sensitive to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| So just a matter of perspective, because people have asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| about the number of scooters that this ordinance would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| So for perspective, the pilot as it stands today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| allows up to 500 total scooters across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| and we estimate that about 400 of those scooters are deployed downtown each day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| and in the Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| So in setting the proposed cap of 300 scooters per vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| we had two considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| The first is what number of this kind of permit cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| would serve the demand that our city creates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| and also what can our infrastructure accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| So on the first question, you all have asked me this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| there is no magic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| 300 is not somehow a line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Companies, quite frankly, would love for us to expand that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| But on the second question, our intention is really to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| that these scooters have a wider coverage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| along some of the key corridors that we are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| from a redevelopment and a connectivity perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| and we also have to limit that clutter in these higher density areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| of downtown and Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| So the key way that the ordinance and the administrative rules do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| is through a best practice called in-street parking corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| And so imagine, if you will, a parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| that currently is available for cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| That is carved out and it becomes similar to a bike corral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| that you've already seen downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| That functions to inherently but significantly limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| the number of scooters that can be deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| in the downtown and Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| And you have a map that you received with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| This map actually only shows 14 locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| There's a 15th location on the south waterfront along Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| but it messes up the geographic vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| So there's only 15 of these corrals that we're planning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| which will inherently limit the downtown deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| and Fort Sanders deployment to 150 total scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| So again, that's actually a significant drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| from what we estimate is happening today, which is about 400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| bringing that total deployment down to 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Excuse me, bringing it down to 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Now again, if we have more infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| if we create more corrals, that number can fluctuate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| But as it stands today, we're planning for 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| which would mean that at any given morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| there's only going to be 150 scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| across the downtown and Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Third, this is another important piece that you all have asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| several questions about, is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| So we know there has to be clear accountability to the vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| when they fail to live up to our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| So both the ordinance and the admin rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| very clearly spell out that we will be fining the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| And this is, again, a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| It's not about going after the users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| It's about saying, if your user messes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| we are fining you, the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| You're the one that has a business and a financial interest in being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| You're the one that's accountable for making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| these things are used properly and parked properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| So it gives us the option not only to fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| but also impound immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And again, these are tools that we have to immediately revoke a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| If we feel that a permit holder is just not cutting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| and that they are routinely violating our expectations around parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| that is the biggest card we pull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| is that we pull their permit and they're off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| So the bottom line is that we can hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| And we also have spelled out some of those clear fine options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| not just for parking but also for some of the other rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| like riding on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| So I will quickly, just again, process-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| we launched a survey in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| We had about 150 responses to that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| In August, we had a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| at the East Tennessee History Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| that laid out the bones of the proposal that you see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| There has been additional refinement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| based on feedback from the public, from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| from CODI, the Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We have talked with the TPO Technical Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| And again, really underlying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| is a lot of research from Peer Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| and extensive review of guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| from the National Association of City Transportation Officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| the NACTO, that our engineering department refers to regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| and, of course, that Dr. Cherry has alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| There's national work going on in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| So that was a lot, and thank you for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| I see a lot of lights. We've got a good team of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| We will dive in as much as we'd like to these specific terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| And I'll also, again, just appreciate in advance Carter Hall, who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Brian Bachman is here from Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| And then also, again, our local expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| who we are grateful to have here at Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| almost by serendipity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| So thank you for being here, Dr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| Thank you, Ms. Kelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Deputy Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| I just wanted you to line that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| because I'm hoping that that answers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| You answered a lot of the questions I was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| And so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Because this is, as Dr. Cherry said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| an emotional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| People, you know, it is polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| So I think sort of addressing the things up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| that I've heard complaints about for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| I appreciate you going over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| Thank you, Ms. Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Councilmember Ryder, and then Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| and then I'll go over to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| So I have several questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| and I'm not sure if the person to answer them is Ms. Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| or Mr. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| We'll try to triage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| How fast do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| They are by permit and by ordinance limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| to no faster than 20 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Hoo-wee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Just to clarify, they make it like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| It's not like the rider has a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Like, the technology doesn't allow you to exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| Well, that's fabulous because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Unlike our cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| I'm married to someone who treats people with head injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| It's terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| I haven't ridden one, and I'm not a fan, but all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| The map that we are given with the corrals is going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| Unless you add more corrals, it's 10 per corral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| and they've mapped out 15 corrals and limits it to 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| Correct, Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| For the Fort Sanders area downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| So, what about, like, right now in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| the food truck park, Happy Holler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| those areas have had scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Are those going to be allowed in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| So, I'm going to ask Carter to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| because I think these will be best directed as we go toward him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| but I will say that, yes, the operating map for the scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| will expand beyond those parking zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| In those zones, there's much more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| but it's, again, recognizing the available infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| that happens when you get out of that higher-density downtown core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| So, Mr. Hall, Happy Holler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| and the North Knoxville Central Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| they won't have corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| Carter Hall, policy and business innovation manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| So, when we were looking at the highest areas of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| and also where we've seen the most problems with clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| on the sidewalks before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| it was very clearly downtown and Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| not so much areas like South Knoxville, North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| East Knoxville, Long Magnolia, where they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| So, when we were thinking about having a somewhat limited approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| to where we would put the corrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| and really trying to be targeted with that solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| just because, again, that does incur costs on the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| trying to keep our costs relatively low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| knowing that we would have to raise...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| We're supplying the corrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| We are supplying the corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| The costs that it takes to install those corrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| is more than made up for by the permit application fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| of $12,000 per two-year operating permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| But, again, the more and more that we add those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| the more we'd have to make the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| the operating permit cost, which reaches a certain point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| where it would be unattainable for basically anyone to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| Also, we have not seen near as many problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| when it comes to parking in other areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| So the short answer to your question is that how it currently is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| when it comes to them being deployed and parked on sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| would continue outside of downtown and Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Part of that is that we do have the higher enforcement abilities now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| so if we continue to see problems outside of those areas or if it got worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| we, again, now have enforcement options with this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| that we did not beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Which leads me to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| they're paying $12,000 or $11,000 some change for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| If we pull their permit because they don't abide by, you know, restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| no refunds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| No refunds and also no refund on their $5,000 bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Mr. Swanson, we don't have to give them a refund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| We get to keep their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Until a judge tells us we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Also, Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| I would just go back to your speed limit question quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| We actually did dance around what that would be at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| and we originally were thinking about 15 miles per hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| but had it at 20 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| At a recommendation of national experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| because it's good to allow skiers to be able to go with the flow of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| which is frequently at 20 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| it's actually more dangerous if we require them to go slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| than a lot of people drive at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| It's because, again, you want them to be able to go with the flow of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| not have them be slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| So we did consider a slower miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| but actually found that it would be more dangerous if we capped it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| at a lower mile per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| They should just have helmets, but I realize we're not regulating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| So I won't dwell on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| They're geofenced from places like Henley and entrance-exit ramps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| but so here's been my issue and experience with scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| other than impeding people in wheelchairs on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| Like I've gone across the Henley Street Bridge at 9 o'clock on a summer night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| and I had people coming at me on the wrong side of the yellow line very fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| and it's up to me, I guess, not to hit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| I mean, I realize they could be on a bicycle and being that stupid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| and then I had somebody near the Hilton downtown run a red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| and I had a car run a red light in front of me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| The difference is, and I did stop and I didn't hit them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| the difference is the person in the car has the car to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| The person on the scooter does not have a vehicle to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I get the point that people can be stupid on any mode of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| It's just the lack of ‑‑ I'll just be real aware with them downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| and I don't know what restrictions we can put on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Do we have any data on out of town versus in town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Yes, we do, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| So I went a few months ago and asked our scooter vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| to pull data on zip codes that we use to sign up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| because you basically access these through a mobile app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| You have to enter what your zip code is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| And looking at that, they had it at about 40% of their users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| had an 865 area code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| But I think when you factor in a lot of students who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| for at least four years probably have an out of town area code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| people who move here with an out of town area code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| people who have been here for a while but just never updated their cell phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| the actual number of people who use the scooters who do live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| but don't have an 865 area code means that we're probably looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| at least 50% of riders are local, if not much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| I've heard that, too, where people are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| oh, these are just things for tourists to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| I think that that's been pretty clearly dispelled by the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| At a bare minimum, I would feel pretty safe betting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| significantly more than 50% of users are local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| Okay. I'll ask my last question and then pass the baton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| You said we have better enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| This goes around from when we did it in the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| What is our better enforcement? What's the tool in the toolbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Currently, the way that enforcement works is we do not have much teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| behind any sort of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| We do not have any clear-stated ability to issue fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| It's basically saying, hey, if we find a scooter that's misused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| KPD has the option to issue a traffic fine to an individual rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| We really want to get away from that model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| both to decrease the amount of interactions of KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| with just somebody riding a scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| KPD also, like, it's not exactly a good policy for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| to just be chasing down people on scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| It's both unnecessary and can be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| So really getting to the point where we can go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| target the companies will let us be much more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| and much more generally actually accurate with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| A lot of the companies are able to go, and if we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| hey, we found a scooter misparked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| or someone was riding on sidewalk at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| here's a picture of it, they're generally able to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| and find through their own data sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| who left the scooter, was riding it improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| and find them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| So it's really we're able to be more responsive and efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| which is something that we're not able to be right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| And, again, as Deputy Mayor Gill laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| we are able now to do things like impound scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| if they're blocking an ADA ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| or any other sort of disruptive way on a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| This allows any city employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| with the proper authorization to move a scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| It requires the vendors to give basically accounts out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| to allow us to move scooters if need be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| and also allow our 311 team to be responsive as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| which is something that's been actually really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| with the 311 app, that we get a lot of those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| We don't get a lot, but when we do get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| which is maybe about one a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| we're able to really immediately turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| and go to the vendors and say, hey, you need to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| But this would allow us, ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| to quickly be able to move them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| So, like, our public works staff would be able...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Those are our boots on the ground that could address...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| They would be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| They would not, unless they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| an authorized municipal enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| they would not be able to issue a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| but they could move them on our call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| A few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Yes, it is getting late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| and I'm starting to forget my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| I should have written them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| One question I had was about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| We've discussed it a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| but I'm still trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| where the geofencing would take place under this new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| It sounds like there is a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| to spread the scooters out around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| more than they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| and so, I mean, I don't know how to ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| without, you know, you listing off all of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| where they're not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| but can you give us a better sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| if this passes, what we will see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| Where we will see scooters in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| that we haven't seen them before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| So, one of the benefits, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| to capping the scooters downtown in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| is that they will be better served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| in other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| That also gets to things like we are requiring vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| in the new ordinance to submit things like equity plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| on how to serve underserved parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| so that people have these as an actual option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| If you look at certain parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| they don't even have these things deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| because I think that they just don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| that that's a market they need to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| We think that everyone in anywhere in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| should have access to all sorts of mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| so we hope that they will be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| in the current operating area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| which is largely just north Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| up to the sort of north end of Happy Holler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| down into Sevier Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| and a little bit in south Knoxville, but not much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| and then down Magnolia and a little bit onto campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| but not past where I think it's Neyland meets Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| We have considered expanding the operating area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| and we likely would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| We work with the traffic folks at KPD really closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| whenever we consider that, as well as engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| just to make sure, again, part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| why I think this has been such a safe program for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| is we're very considerate in where we allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| so it's not a sort of willy-nilly like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| oh, sure, let's let them down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| We really try to take our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| and make sure that they go places they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| An additional thing that was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| is this ordinance does allow us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| it allows us to allow scooters on greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| but the operating area does not currently include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| many of our major greenways, including Third Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| so we would not immediately have them on our greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| but when we would look at expanding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| it would likely include some of those greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| after considerations from folks like the Greenway Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| and Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| But, again, it's where there's both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| we would consider it to be where people need to be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| by additional mobility, not necessarily market demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| because, again, we have these tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| through things like our equity zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| that are built into this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| and administrative rules and things like the equity plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| that we require to allow them to serve all parts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| not just downtown and Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| I hope that that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| It helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| I mean, I still, you know, well, you mentioned Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| As in they are not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| They are not, no, and we would not allow them on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| That's one thing that we've made pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| in talking with vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| They also don't want people on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| because that would be pretty, yeah, dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| So while we would look at finding a way to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| like westward is a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| like into maybe Bearden or somewhere in the Sutherland area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| it would need to be in a way that we would feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| working with, again, KPD engineering, the vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| that would be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| And using, for example, Third Creek as a connective point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| would be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| And then when we look at the side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| for instance, off of Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| would they be able to go onto all of those side streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| They currently, we do allow them in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Oh, interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| And would it go all the way down the Houston Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| We would be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| It does not currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| but I do not see why we wouldn't be open to allowing that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| And in terms of the share of scooters in the city versus e-bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| why is there so much emphasis on scooters versus e-bikes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| When it comes down to that, it's a pretty heavy market decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| It's already the 50 bike cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| I've heard back from some vendors saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| that might be kind of tough to swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| And we've come back to them and said, well, you can swing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| We believe in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| And we'll be able to pull that off because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| we do want e-bikes to serve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| A number of scooters, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| it comes down to the vendors need to make enough money to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| basically subsidize e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| That's kind of how all this works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| is the standing scooters and seated scooters are the money makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| The vendors typically lose money running an e-bike program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| That's why we don't have a standalone e-bike or regular bike share program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| So, by allowing more scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| it helps us subsidize those bike share programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| Why it's set at a 50 bike minimum is because that's what we felt, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| is a minimum number that could help serve demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| but also was high enough to where the vendors could meet that expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7327)|
| 2:02:15| I have ridden the scooters and I rode a scooter down Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| and it scared me half to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| I will not get on that scooter again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| I was riding a scooter down Gay Street, screaming my head off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| telling everybody to get out of the way because I don't know what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| So, but when I look at the ordinance, it says, or at least our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| it says that riders may be cited for improper riding or parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| Has that already been implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Have we had that policy in place where individuals could be cited for riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| these scooters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| Again, that's the way that our current enforcement policy works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| but it's not typically done, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| because we have not been encouraging KPD to chase people down on scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| Again, how this switch enforcement work is if someone was misriding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| scooter, a proper documentation that we need to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| which is basically photo evidence is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| we are able to then go to the vendor and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| this person at this time was misriding this scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| The vendors are then able to go in, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| in their own databases, figure out who that person was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| and pass on the fee to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| So we would be citing, like to use an example of one of our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| vendors, like let's say we see somebody misriding a Veo scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| We would fine Veo the $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| provide them the evidence of how it was being misused or misparked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| and then they would be able to go in and track down the person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| misparked it or was misriding it and pass that fee along to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| through an agreement that the riders sign on the front end when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| sign up for the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| This is how it's done in a lot of other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| Seattle, Chicago, and Atlanta are just a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| and it's after talking with staff there and talking with vendors who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| operate there, they said the system actually tends to work out pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| It can create situations where a rider might not be found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| but we as a city are still able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| It creates a lot of impetus on the vendors to be keeping track of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| who might be misusing or misparking scooters and, again, pass those on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| So, again, when it has been implemented like this in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| it's gone well from what we've heard and is generally considered best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| practice at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| And I think if I can chime in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| the inherent thing is that you want the company to be responsible for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| because then it creates a profit motive for them to educate their riders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| better, and all of those things that you do when you select in the app to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| say, I acknowledge I'm not going to ride on the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| that's kind of what we're trying to get at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| which is that people get educated on the front end and the company has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| role in making sure that they follow through on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| Okay, so that would all go through the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| As you said, KPD is not going to be chasing down folks on scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| That's helpful because if that were the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| then my next question would be about the public education and how do folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| know what is a citable offense on a scooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| but it's all in that contract that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| I think that's all of my questions for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Council Member Smith and then Council Member Testament, you're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| So I just want to say I really want to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| but I do have, I continue to have a number of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| You know, I think they certainly can be an asset and a value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| You know, I've been in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| I've ridden scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| I've ridden e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| And, you know, they've been in cities that are really well organized as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| as logistics and the deficiencies and the accountability factor, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| And so I'm a little confused just in my experience on how we haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| able to implement some of the provisions that I have seen in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| that work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| I mean, the geofencing, I understand, you know, not going on your busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| roadways, but I've also experienced if you go down the wrong way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| down a one-way street, it shuts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| If you, you know, go down, get on a sidewalk, it shuts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| You know, I think the corrals are a great way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| I don't really see having enough of them for the number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| I mean, I have a lot of pictures on my phone over the past year where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I've taken photos that just have given me a great deal of heartburn of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| scooters being truly littered all over, just in the most random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| I don't, I mean, it's kind of unbelievable to me that, you know, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| And I just, so like in my experience, if they aren't corralled in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| appropriate place, well, that meter keeps running and the rider continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| to be charged, you know, which I think is a huge incentive for riders to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| you know, be more responsible about, you know, what I presume is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| expensive equipment, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| You know, so I just, a couple of questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7661)|
| 2:07:46| You know, it's back to the enforcement and the accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| I don't see, I mean, for our earlier discussion on speeding, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| I wish somebody would send, you know, a speeding ticket to Ford Motor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| Company should I get one versus holding me accountable for, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| that's kind of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| It's like, well, I'm the offender, I'm the driver, rider, yet my infraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| is going to be at the expense of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| I don't, tell me, like, who is boots on the ground for those companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| And are we dependent on people calling in complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| I just, I don't quite understand the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Who's going to be responsible for citing a rider if APD is not going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| you know, doing warnings and citations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| And we've had this pilot now for nearly two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| I mean, it's, I don't know, I think there are few, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| citations that have ever been issued that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| and I'm sure Chief Thomas can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| but there are a lot of people that are downtown dwellers that do not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| this because of just kind of the nuisance and the lack of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| And I really would like to understand a more comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| where that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| I'll try to start at some of the first comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| particularly around technology and geofencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| Upon approval of this ordinance, if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| that would kickstart us into a new RFP competitive bid process to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| potentially different vendors than we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| We've been operating with essentially the same two vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| under the entire pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| A big part of that is because we want to make sure that the people getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| these operating permits are at the forefront of geofence technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| of other technologies in terms of proper ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| So we view this ordinance passing as, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| an additional opportunity to go back and make sure that we are contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| and giving out these operating permits to people with the highest level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| technological advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| When it comes to the enforcement piece, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| the riders will largely be the ones who are facing the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| It's just not necessarily coming from the city of Knoxville as the ones who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| are fining or citing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| It is coming from the vendors through their licensing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| So using your analogy, it would be like Ford going to you and saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| we know that you sped in one of our cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| Here's the proof in your contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| You said you wouldn't do that, so now we have to pass on this fine to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| So that is the structure that's worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| Again, we're trying to avoid the current model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| which is KPD being the ones with the sole responsibility of tracking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| misusing scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| With the switch, it expands the amount of people who have enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| abilities to basically everyone who works on this and on city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| We have talked with PBA about expanding our contract with them to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| fold in scooter mis-parking into their normal rounds that they do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| manage car parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| That's something that they said would not be an issue to work into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| current contract with them and just add it on as something to where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| would be able to cite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Again, they're going after vendors, right, not individual riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| So the actual administrative burden is pretty low because it's only one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| two companies that they'll be citing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| So we think that we have really expanded our flexibility and just general ease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| of knowing who to enforce the ordinance rules on and the administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| on that will allow us to actually do it more, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| we just currently are not able to do at a higher level in a way that KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| feels comfortable with and generally vendors and riders probably also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| wouldn't feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| You're telling me so PBA enforcement officials who are monitoring parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7913)|
| 2:12:01| we also have KPD cadets that are monitoring parking violations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| I'm just trying to figure out who's making the report to the actual vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| and can that be Joe Q. Public, who's walking down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| who sees a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| I'm just going back to accountability and to enforcement because that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| the greatest, I think, challenge that the complaints that I know that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7947)|
| 2:12:34| gotten, that I've seen, that there's just no boundary, it seems, to a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7954)|
| 2:12:44| us, and it seems to be minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| So I'm really, I want it to, it's going to roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| I want it to be set up for success and to be able to create the buy-in of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| those naysayers to say, you know, okay, this is a much better program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| It's much, you know, it's well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| There are actually criteria to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| I mean, they're vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I mean, it's a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| It's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| So I guess I'm just looking for a little more depth on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Again, I think that we've really put in and we've expanded not only the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| of enforcement that we're able to do in terms of not just traffic citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| but also, again, now KPD is able to impound vehicles if need be or devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| We're really greatly expanding the amount of people who are able to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| citations or let people know what the issues are for citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| And, again, the general public is always able to let us know if there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| issue through the 311 app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Again, with some of the other built-in things such as the daily rebalancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| and restaging that would be new with this ordinance, we think in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| we're getting to the front end of these issues not occurring in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| It's a lot easier to, you know, if we don't have to worry about enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| if we're not seeing the issues as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| And I think that that, again, is what this ordinance is designed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| is really cut down on those issues in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| Or if a scooter is mis-parked, it's going to be taken care of quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| instead of being somewhere it shouldn't be for, you know, hours or days on end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| So just to that point, if a vendor is going to do it more quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| how is that different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| I mean, I've seen that a lot in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| That may or may not end up in one of our permit forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| Can you speak a little bit more into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| How is it going to be more timely than we've been seeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| We have, again, we have the daily restaging requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| And, again, now we sort of have this stick to enforce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| that we do not currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| And we did not have that within the term of the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Can I jump in and clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| So there's two elements of punitive financial implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| that can come about from misuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| The first is citation, and that is a tool that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| and will use when we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8129)|
