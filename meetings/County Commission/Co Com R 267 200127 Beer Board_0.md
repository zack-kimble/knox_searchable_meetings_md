| 0:12:22| Currently the second – yeah, I'll look to Commissioner Smith to make the motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Since Commissioner Carringer is not here at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| I make the motion to approve subject to the Health Department's final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| So we have a motion on the floor based on you need to turn in all documents that we've referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| that you have not turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| I heard from the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| I've got a note regarding the previous beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Has that been turned in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Has the previous beer permit been surrendered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| It's opening on February 6th, so hopefully we do before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| You understand what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| We have the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Is he clear that he needs to have the previous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I want to make sure you understand because I've got a note from the clerk's office when they prepared our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| that one thing that's out there that's pending that you've got to get turned in before you're good to go is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| apparently there's a – did you have, or I'm going to look to the clerk for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| the previous beer permit for this location or someone else had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| So there's a beer permit for this location that's out there somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| and we want to verify if that has been turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| The same corporation, same LLC, or the different LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Just permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| I don't care who owns it, but we just need to get the last beer permit for that location turned in so that you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| So that and the pending inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So those are two things you've got to get done before you can open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Now I'll reference back to Commissioner Smith has made the motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| And there's a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Make sure you see the young lady to get your paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| So wave your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| You know, we see these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| When somebody opens a new business, if there's a previous location there that had a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| why does it fall upon the person who's opening the business to turn in the previous person's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| Couldn't we just have things void where two can't be issued at the same location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| And if a new one comes, the previous one's void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| It's required to be turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Is that a Knox County ordinance or is that a state ordinance that makes that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| I'll have to check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I'm not sure which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| It's probably our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| It might be worth either through charter review or just commission review to clean that up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| I agree with you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| It seems like an undue burden on the person opening a new store to be responsible for the previous owner's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| And is the previous owner ever notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| They're usually ones in the sale and the application and the notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Do you send one to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| That's true if you had an owner occupying the business before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| But a lot of these are new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| They get no permit if they surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| We have two permits on one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Is that the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| We've never been able to issue one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| If there's an outstanding permit, we have to have that one surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| But if you could please summarize what she said to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| She said that they always have required that to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| And they send it to the applicant because that's the one that's wanting it done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and they're more motivated to get it done than the other person may or may not be motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Usually that certificate is hanging on the wall in the business in which they're going to hang theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| So they just take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| But I guess my point is if somebody is not happy that their landlord goes up $1,000 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| and they decide to leave, they can take that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| and that keeps somebody else from being able to operate that business in the future there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| I don't know that we've run into that since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| What I might suggest just is that could be sometimes we've got to link the agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| but we do have some billboard meetings where we have a relatively short agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| but just approve a couple of items or levy a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| That might be something that would be appropriate, and I'm going to look to the clerk's office for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| to work with the law director and myself to get that as a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| on the February meeting of the Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Next item, we have Stanley David Armstrong with the Quick Service Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| And Mr. Armstrong, please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And I have to ask, any relation to this gentleman to my left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| You might live in the community, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Stanley David Armstrong, 4511 Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| That's real close, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Okay, real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| All right, sir, the law director does have a few questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Mr. Armstrong, you heard the questions that I asked the previous people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| and you understand your under oath and testifying for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any of the crimes or laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| or crimes involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| I think beer has been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Okay, you need to have that certificate turned in before you get yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| So it's in his hand right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| So you can turn that in to the clerk before you leave if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| The application is for off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Do you own the particular location or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Does that person who is leasing, do they have any interest in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Does anyone else have an interest in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| You're an LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| You're a sole proprietorship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1104)|

| 0:18:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Who will operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| You will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with these laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Have you completed your server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1125)|

| 0:27:06| your light is on, although the motion should probably come from the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I make a motion to approve with all the pendings in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1631)|

| 0:27:14| And there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1635)|

| 0:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I've been with Ms. Boatman for 23 years in business, and she's almost 76 and wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| But I do have the Health Department and the Codes Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| They came up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Health Department says no permit necessary, and the Codes gave their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| I've got it on email on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Yeah, you just have to turn it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Did the previous business also sell off-premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Did the previous business owner also sell off-premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Bare to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| And just in running a tavern, be very, very careful in that type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| No tabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| I would like to see her inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1708)|

| 0:28:45| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1725)|

| 0:28:52| So you're good on the Health Department inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Is it the CO that we're just looking for right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1736)|

| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127beerboard?start=1741)|
