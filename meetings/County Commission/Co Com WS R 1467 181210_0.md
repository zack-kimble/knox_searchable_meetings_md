| 0:01:45| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=105)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you. Before we jump into tonight's agenda, I do want to thank and recognize some of the elected officials that I've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| even with my nearsightedness, I've been able to see in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| First, I'd like to thank Mayor Jacobs. Thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Also, I've noticed all the department heads are present tonight. Thank you all for your attentiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| And right now, I'm going to ask one of them to stand up, not because you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| But, Jim, why don't you go ahead and stand up? Snowden, yeah, quit looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=139)|
| 0:02:26| You know, Commissioner Biggs and I were talking right before the meeting, and we, I think as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| we'd like to call attention to the good work that your team put in over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| I know when you get those snow calls, it can be kind of quite a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| But even as it started to melt, I know you all were out in force, and I just wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| This is a great warm-up for what could be some worse winter weather ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| But thank you so much for your team's attentiveness to our roads this weekend through the storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| Also, I believe, even with my nearsightedness, I do believe my school board member, Jennifer Owen, back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| So, Jennifer, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| And we have our school superintendent, Super Bob Thomas, in the back corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| Are there any other elected officials that I may not have seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Where's Sheriff Spangler? Is the sheriff here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| There he is. Thank you, Sheriff Spangler. Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| And I see Nick McBride in the back, so thank you, Nick, for joining us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| And maybe one of the few meetings we do not have an Ed Schaus sighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| We did recognize the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Next, as we work through our agenda, and I do see a handful of folks who are here that I haven't seen at these meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| and I want to just give you just a quick, I'm talking about you, Jed Dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| what we do at these meetings, this is the work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| So this is not the meeting where our votes actually count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| We work through our agenda at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| We set some items on our consent agenda that will then be carried forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Next week, we will have the formal vote on all of the items that we are discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| So this is a work session to be a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| So just to clarify that for some of our audience members who this might be one of their first meetings to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Now, moving forward, we, our office, did not receive any phone calls before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| but I do want to ask if there's any members of the public who would like to address county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| Are there any, just if you are with the public and you'd like to address commission, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=273)|
| 0:04:45| All right, seeing none, we're now at the part of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Where we will be doing amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Shortly before this meeting, our finance chair, or excuse me, our director of our finance, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| advised me that there was a couple of important items that he wanted to share with commission that we should add as discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| So, Mr. Caldwell, if you could please approach the podium and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| One is about a swap lawsuit, a settlement that we're working on with our bond attorney and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=313)|
| 0:05:24| I'm going to go over that with you and how that process is working and the amount and what we need to do to finalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| And the second thing is an update on a jail overcrowding task force that the mayor has established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=329)|
| 0:05:39| and a contract that we'll be working on with a jail consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| Okay, we will add those to the stern of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Madam Clerk, if you could please note that when we work through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| All right, are there any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| My fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Yes, sir, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| If it's possible, I'd like to hear about the A.J. building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| I notice that's been taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| If Mr. Caldwell could just update us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| My fellow commissioners, are there any other items you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Seeing none, we'll move on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| The next part of our agenda is where we approve the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| I'll entertain a motion for approving the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| A motion has been made by Commissioner Jay and seconded by Commissioner Carringer to approve the last month's minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| Actually, I meant to add to the stern of the agenda, but we can go ahead and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| What I'd like to do since these items have just came up and they do have some meat, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| can we go ahead and just add you to this part of the agenda to jump into this quick discussion before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=422)|
| 0:07:14| Because you've got about three items now to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| Let's kind of go down in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| So we received word about a week and a half ago that we knew there was a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| It's dealing with Deutsche Bank and LIBOR, and it got settled here recently, and there's a settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| And we have swaps that involve that bank as it relates to LIBOR, and so we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| We've been offered a settlement agreement on a couple of our swaps that would pay us a settlement amount of $2.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| and so that's pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| And we have a few more swaps that we're still working on, and that could be an amount that's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| it won't be that amount, it may be $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 more that we haven't finalized on that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| And so what we have to do is these are time-sensitive, worked with Bud Armstrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| and so we're trying to finalize the first piece and get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| The mayor has to sign that in order for it to be a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| We always would bring contracts back to county commission and usually try to bring those beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| But since this is a settlement offer from, I guess, a court in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| then I think we're going to have to let the mayor sign off on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| and then we'll bring that contract before you all after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| And so I just wanted you to be aware, I'll try to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| It is a large sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| It's at least $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| It could be as much as three with the other swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Now, what we will do with this funding once it comes back in is this has been paid out of debt service fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| and debt service payments since this has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| so we would just reimburse the debt service fund, and that would go back into fund balance of debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Okay, yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Mr. Caldwell, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Mr. Caldwell, is this a lawsuit that we initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| or we are part of it as a collective because of our relationship with Deutsche Bank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| And so because of our relationship that it involves a swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| and it involves the issue of LIBOR, then we are a party to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| Okay, so this is not something triggered by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Okay, go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Okay, I'll go on to the next item since we're done with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| And also what I will do, just going back to the first one for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| what we will do is once those are finalized and signed off on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| we'll add those to the agenda hopefully in January so you all will be aware of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| and we can provide you with those documents at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| We have been involved in a jail overcrowding task force that the mayor has established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| and it includes myself, Chief of Staff Brian Hare, Commissioner Larson Jay, Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| another Chief of Police, and District Attorney Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| And so we've been going through this process about how we can handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| and solve this jail overcrowding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| We have went through the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| and had sought a contract with a jail consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and so we're moving ahead with that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| And so we'll be bringing you updates as we go forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| They haven't started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| They just kind of briefed us last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| and so we got an estimated amount of what that contract will be, and it will be ran through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=658)|
| 0:11:08| But we're looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| I know the sheriff has briefed you all on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| so I wanted to make you aware of that potential contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Moving on to item number three, Commissioner Biggs asked about where we are with the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| So what we chose to do was we had-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| I just saw a light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I see two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| Commissioner Gill, did you have a question earlier about the second point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Are there any members of the community on this task force that was established by the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| And you have one representative from the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Commissioner Jay is on it from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| I am not aware of a member of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| and so basically it's a committee that we started that the mayor established a month or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| to look into the issue that was raised by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| And so I think we have discussed a citizen member, but we have not added that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=734)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Commissioner Gill, any other follow-up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| The County Technical Assistance Service has a jail consultant non-retainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Have we approached them for their expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| because this individual has a tremendous amount of expertise in dealing with county jails across the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| We have not, but we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I'm not opposed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| We have been working through PBA, which has used the contractor who ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| excuse me, the architect who had done the detention facility at Maloneyville Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| and they have recommended a jail consultant, but we're happy to look at others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Any other follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Item three, which is the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| So we had deferred that for a few months, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| and so we decided just to pull it off until we could bring it back instead of just keep on deferring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| And so the removing of it had nothing to do with anything besides just deferring it every month was kind of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=821)|
| 0:13:51| So we pulled that just to try to get some things finalized as it relates to where we may move schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=831)|
| 0:14:01| and how that process is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| So ultimately our bond attorney, Mark Mametoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| is still reviewing some drafts and working with Charlie Sharkey in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| And so once we finalize that contract or get close to finalizing it to bring it before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=855)|
| 0:14:24| we thought it was best to bring the A.J. at the same time as where that move may be happening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Any other follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I just had people question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Yes, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Chris, on the credit swaps, how accurately can we track these back and make sure we're getting our fair share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| I mean, is it easier than sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| It's difficult, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| And so quite frankly, I don't want to give our hand away, but I think we're actually to the positive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=895)|
| 0:15:06| So I think we're getting more than we thought we would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| And so we're not going to speak to that much, but I think it's a settlement agreement that was reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| and we had a number of swaps, and so I think we're getting more than our fair share worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Chris, any other updates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Moving on to our agenda, we've got Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I do need to go over consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you for that reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Here to review, we've had a few items I've posted on the forum, and then there are a few other items that were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| So just to review our consent and withdrawals, though it's on zoning and won't hit until next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| Item 48, just as a reminder, that was in your original agenda for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Item 48 is in zoning, and that's a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| The non-consent items that we'll be discussing tonight, items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=965)|
| 0:16:22| 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=982)|
| 0:16:43| Otherwise, all the other items will remain under consent unless one of you mentions to me right now that you want to pull something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| I also want to add for the audience and for some of our department heads who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| there are some times when we do pull things not because we want to question them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| but mainly because we find them interesting and worthy of sharing with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| So I know there was a couple of interesting items I pulled that I thought the public would be pleased to see happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| Another item I want to make a brief comment on is Item 33, which is related to the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| That is something that we may want to delay to the discussion as it relates to the items for our legislative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| And I'm looking at Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I know that we want to talk about that one separately or make that part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Well, we have the Register of Deeds in the audience this evening, and I think he had another commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| So if he could follow through with the order of the agenda, I think that would be to his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| He's shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I'd like to just ask a question about Item Number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| Let's also pull 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1072)|
| 0:18:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We will move on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Charlie, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Madam Clerk, Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Will you make a motion to approve the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Carringer and a second by Commissioner Gill to approve this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Let's move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Item Number 5 is consideration of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee honoring David Shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1123)|

| 0:20:28| of $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1228)|

| 0:22:05| If there is any discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1327)|

| 0:22:16| If I could, I understand this may be just a little bit unusual, but I know our sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| has to speak at 6 p.m. at the victim's remembrance ceremony, and I wonder if we could just move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1342)|

| 0:22:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| The chair will grant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Where is the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Sheriff Spangler, would you like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Item number 25 is approving and accepting the terms of an interstate corporation contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| with the State of Texas Department of Information Resources to allow Knox County to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| law enforcement-related information resource technologies through DIR Contracts Resolution 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I'll tell you, I'm the one who pulled this because I thought it was a good example of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| a way for us to save money by using other contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| So if you want to go ahead and just share just a little bit about this particular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you, County Commission, for allowing me to come up here a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| What it is is that this allows us to use vendors, many vendors out of the State of Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| They are geared more towards law enforcement IT things, and one of the things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| using right now to look at purchasing that we have gotten from them to try out is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| license plate reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| We have, for the past two months, used that particular piece of equipment, and it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| scanned over 600,000 tags within Knox County in one location, and we have also recovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| three stolen vehicles from out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So what it allows us to do, and it notifies us, but that's just one of the many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| that this will allow us to do, to go to those vendors in the State of Tennessee, adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| them as vendor, I'm sorry, State of Texas, and using those and not having to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and reapply with every time that we try to do something with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| So hopefully that will help, and it's not costing anything to be able to add them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The Chair will entertain a motion to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I just have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| So your IT services would include what under this particular vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| Well, they have the option or they have the equipment that we can look at anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| other than within our IT department if we need it, but it also services, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| the license plate reader, also any of our radars that we use, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| So it would just emphasize and help more within our IT if we need it there, but it does give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| us those options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1496)|

| 0:25:01| Yes, it does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| But then there are some things that we can either purchase through them or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1505)|

| 0:25:10| Is there any other states that we can piggyback on those type contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| We've got other, there probably are, but we've got six agencies within the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| that are using them now also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| So that kind of gives us an idea that whatever it is that those agencies are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| it's working with them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1525)|

| 0:27:29| I wanted to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I know that this falls under the things that I think are interesting that we may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| get a quick update on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| It's come up for discussion in the past, and I want to be clear that I think it's a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| idea that we're doing this, but if someone from the school board could just kind of tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| us a little bit about what we're working on through this particular lobbyist group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I know it's part of the large schools group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| Mr. Chair, Clifford Davis, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| Millsat Scowen Government Relations actually advocates on the part of CLAS, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1684)|
| 0:28:13| Coalition of Large Area School Systems, and the members of CLAS are the big four school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| That would be Knox County Schools, that would be Hamilton County, Shelby County, and Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| And one of the main things that they do is actually they track legislation, and we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| have, during the time that the legislature is in session, we actually have weekly conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| calls where they actually go through the legislation that's being discussed at the time and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| through the impact of that legislation, the potential impact on the large four school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| And then also they monitor changes in terms of changes that come from the State Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| of Education as well, and so those are some of the things that they do for us as a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Also, we just had one of our weekly phone calls or conferences last week, and one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| the things that they wanted to do was they wanted to come up to speed in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| legislative priorities for the big four school systems so they can actually have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| and actually advocate on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| I know that there's a, I'm going to call on Commissioner Anders in just a second, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| I know we're always working hard to secure more BEP funding and there's always, seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| like in our state, there's always sometimes, though conflict's not quite the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| but sometimes we have competing interests with some of our rural partners as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| the metro areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| So I think this is a great idea that y'all are doing and have done in the past to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| advocate for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Yes, sir, Dr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| A question I guess, really, are the big four, are they going to talk about BEP funding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| calculations again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| We kind of threatened to do something three or four years ago and they said they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| going to do more funding for BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| And so where do we stand with that as a state and how would this firm and how the big four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| feel about reengaging on that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Well, I think that's always an ongoing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| I know that I've been working with a group along with a designated board member, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1823)|

| 0:30:36| basis funding is a concern and so that's always one of the issues that they're advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| in terms of the large four school systems, in terms of additional funding for the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1842)|

| 0:31:59| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Mr. Roswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| I had a question about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| The agenda here says it is a cost of $46,000, but on the documentation we were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| online, the fiscal note on it says $9,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I'm confused about the $35,000 difference in the backup paperwork to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| If you could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Commissioner Jay, the total cost is actually $46,000 for the two days of training, $23,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| for a January and a February workshop that will have 54 teachers that will attend from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| the middle schools that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| So you're just not sure how the fiscal note says $9,200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| My fiscal note, well, I'm looking at the one we have from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| I've got $23,000 for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| So, yeah, I don't have that one that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| That's the one online on the agenda attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So I think if the one online is inaccurate and the one that you have is accurate, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| they could submit that to the chair for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| We'll get that to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| You can get that to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I just wanted to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| That's my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Page three, item number 15, is a resolution approving a visible body subscription agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2013)|

| 0:33:49| $6,313, resolution 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| The reason why I was asking about this, is this the same company that has some schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| like some public schools and things like that, like was in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| Is that the same group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| You know, as far as the history of this one, I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| As far as the company that it's with, I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I know this was a grant through, a teacher renewal grant through our Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| partners, and teachers across the district can apply for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| So, this is part of Farragut's anatomy and physiology, and I know this is a software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| that allows, through a university, the anatomy and physiology teachers, or excuse me, students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| exposure to kind of a virtual autopsy to be able to go through the body through that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| But I'm not positive about the relationship to the institution you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Well, there are schools all across the country that has this same name with it, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| one in Nashville that's recently closed down, and there's a couple of others in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| that have started to close down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I was just wondering what the, if you looked in the background, the physical state of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| particular company we're getting this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| I know it's a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| It's considered in the school about $6,300, but it did show a little bit of worrisome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| about their financial stability when they start closing schools down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And one of them was here in Nashville is what I noticed, and then there was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| And then the rating of people that rated their schools was like a 3.5 out of, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| a full five ratings for what their product was in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| So that's just my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| I just want to know how physical stable, if you checked into that or not, and if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| were in conjunction with each other with this software in developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| But you don't know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| These grants are not part of our general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| They're part of a grant from Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And so I'm not aware of the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Item number 17 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of an emergency impact aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| grant from the Tennessee Department of Education in the amount of $13,375 designated for covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| cost of six students displaced by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| There's a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| I'm actually the one that pulled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| John, I found this kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| And I was frankly curious if this was related to students who were here temporarily or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| this new students have come into our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| And I guess I'd never really thought through the potential impact of hurricanes that seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| to be out of our community and their fiscal impact on our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| So if you could provide just a little bit of insight on this before we pass it, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| that would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| This periodically happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I mean, I can think back probably to Hurricane Katrina and some places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| So as far as all these students are new to our district and are eligible for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Are they permanent or temporary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Well, I think they're all temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| But the majority of them end up staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| We saw that again through Hurricane Katrina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Lots of students who came ended up staying in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| So there's not a guarantee of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| But these funds actually come because they're classified as homeless due to the displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| from the natural disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| So these funds come to provide additional materials, teaching support, and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| So again, typically we've seen in the past that most of the time these students do stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| around if they're able to acclimate well to the new school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Any other questions, my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2304)|

| 0:39:04| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Is this essentially like a piggyback on another contract that's already been negotiated that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| with a sister school district in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Metro Nashville bid this about two or three years ago, and they were the agent for a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| of systems around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| We're not the only ones buying off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I just wanted some clarification about why we were jumping on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2373)|

| 0:39:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| This is kind of as a disclosure, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| ENA Services bought one of my husband's companies back a few years ago, and my husband was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| employed by ENA Services in Nashville and was involved in this Internet school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| when they did all the Internet for the schools in the state of Texas as well as other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| So he is not involved with them at this moment, but I just wanted to disclose that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| I didn't want anybody associating that we were getting any, I guess, monetary from ENA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| Services anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2416)|

| 0:40:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| So, Mr. Oaks, the $840,000, is that to cover Internet for all of the Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| That's for FY20 is what we're projecting, $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| That is all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| That's about 100% increase from this year to next for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| Our expenses this year, our Internet access this year is about $430,000, but because of projected changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| in our free and reduced population, we will go from an 80% rebate to a 60% rebate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| So it about doubles our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2462)|

| 0:42:38| If you could just explain this a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I was trying to understand, and I know I think you sent some additional information this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| If you could just sort of explain about this program and essentially how we have an excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| of $1.2 million that is being used for something different than the nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| It's not being used for something different than the nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| This is a fund balance designation within the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Just explain it then, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Let me give the 10,000-foot view, and then I'll let our Director of Nutrition Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| Brett Foster, talk to you about any details you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| But the school nutrition program operates as a separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| It's a separate budget managed completely separate from the general purpose budget or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| any other budget within the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| And it functions entirely off of receipts through the sale of food and reimbursements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| And we are required to maintain a fund balance of three months' worth of revenue, three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| months' operating expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| And when we exceed three months' operating expense, the state likes to see us draw it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| And what you're seeing is how the Food Service Department proposes to draw down their overage this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| And that is with basically purchasing of capital needs, it looks like most of that expenditure is going towards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| To equipment, purchase and repair of equipment that is directly related to food service, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| So that when I think of a nutrition program, what you're encompassing could be the supplies to use the nutrition program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| or prepare the nutrition program or house the nutrition, you know, food, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2671)|

| 0:45:25| I didn't mean to keep it on the pulled agenda, so I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Item number 33 is a resolution urging the Tennessee General Assembly to support restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| for the full 5% commission to the Register of Deeds, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| The motion to approval has been made by Commissioner Anders, with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Mr. Chairman and Commission, thanks for having me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Nick McBride, Knox County Register of Deeds, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| What's in front of you all is a resolution urging the Tennessee General Assembly to restore the 5% commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| that registers across the state are due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| The clerks, for an example, when they collect tax for the governor, they get a 5% commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| The registrar's office is supposed to get a 5% commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Back in 2006, when the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System was not financially funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2790)|
| 0:46:39| and was not one of the top three in the state, the Tennessee General Assembly decided to take 2.6%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| of the 5% commission that the registrar's retained that stayed here in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| They diverted that money to TCRS, and they did that for about nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Once TCR became funded, what Comptroller Wilson would refer to as fully funded sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| and I can congratulate them, but as we all know, the majority of our employees aren't on TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| And so Knox County, from January 1st of 2007 to today, Knox County has lost $4.22 million to TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2831)|
| 0:47:26| and to the general fund in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| The Registrar's Association last year had legislation in front of the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| and as we all know, these items get put at the heel of the agenda, and they're back in with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| And so the Tennessee Registrar's Association, working with the Mayor's Association, the County Commission Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| and the County Officials Association of Tennessee are pushing again to get this money retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| so that we can keep that money here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Fortunately, the Knox County Register of Deeds Office, we are turning over excess fees, as you all know, quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| So what are we looking at financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| In Knox County, year to date, if we had this 2.6% commission, it would be another $455,000 turned over to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2885)|
| 0:48:17| And so this resolution that is before you all is a resolution that is before all 95 counties, to my knowledge, across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| urging the Tennessee General Assembly to restore the 2.6% to make a whole, the 5% which state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| In talking to the General Assembly and some of our senators and representatives, Dr. Briggs, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Senator Briggs thought this was a great idea and was co-sponsor on some of the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| As you all know, the hollow income tax and many other revenue streams have been taken from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| and shifted to the state or just gotten rid of all completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| And so as Dr. Briggs referenced, he said this is a small step in returning monies back to the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| And with that, I would answer any questions and ask for your approval of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| Okay. I notice that Commissioner Smith has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I'd like to point out that this is not a tax increase in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| This is a fee that is already being charged. It's just a redistribution of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| I do have the question of when you say we have no county employees on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| sometimes it's hard to define where teachers lie in their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| But I wonder, is this something that the state will just turn around and send back to our school board to fund now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| No. And you are correct. We do have some teachers and there are a few elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| We, of course, do have state judges and some employees in the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| But what I was referring to is our general population of Knox County employees are not on TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| whereas I believe 92 counties, all of their employees are on TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| So it was something easy for the General Assembly to pass at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| because they were solving a problem for most of the counties, just not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| But I guess my question is, if we have them let us retain that 2.6 percent, will—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| The state law currently says that the register retains 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| Right, but we have to—we're donating 2.6 percent to the retirement program. Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| Not anymore. It now goes into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Two years ago, now that TCRS is fully funded, the General Assembly has moved that money over to just the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| Of the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Of the state's general fund, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| And so all we're wanting is this money to come back to the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| OK. Thank you, Nan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| All right, thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Nick, I think everybody needs to keep in mind, too, that last year the state of Tennessee collected over $703 million in excess revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3061)|
| 0:51:13| And the point is this extra 2.6 for those registered deeds offices that are efficiently run like yours are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| that money now that you're sending to the state could come back to our general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| where we can then decide where that money is best used here instead of sending it back to Nashville again where they have a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| Absolutely. And just to remind you, the full 5 percent commission, we won't have to send the 2.6 to Nashville and then get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| We'll get retained here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Yes. We'll retain the 5 percent like we're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And you might also want to tip them off, too, that the state, if the 95 counties don't submit that 2.6 percent by the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3107)|
| 0:51:57| there's a 50 percent penalty that's charged for not filing that money that they're currently collecting, which I think is insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3117)|
| 0:52:06| Yes, sir. All the constitutional offices are responsible to get those monies to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Unfortunately, we're one of the last ones to be able to do electronic fund transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| but I look forward to that day to where we can hold that money until the last minute and gain that good interest that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| So, yeah, we'll be able to check 10, 12 days in advance just to make sure that check gets to the Department of Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| because I'm sure as your finance director will tell you, late payments don't go well with the governor and the Tennessee Department of Revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Mr. McBride, do you foresee that you have any additional needs within the Registered Needs Office that if you were to get this funding back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| and be able to retain it in Knox County, you would need it to further operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| or do you feel like you can run as normal in that ultimately this may be able to just go to the bottom line of what goes back to the general fund in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3174)|
| 0:53:03| Sir, we do not need any additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| The Registered Needs Office is funded, and this money would go back to the general fund for you all to decide where that money is to be earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you. Thank you for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Nick, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly that 92 counties that all their employees are on TCRS, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3200)|
| 0:53:30| Pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Plus, you know, you've also got municipalities and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Yeah. Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention and for being concerned because every bit really makes a difference for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3217)|
| 0:53:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Yes. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Okay. Seeing no more lights, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| The ayes have it. It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Good luck, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Item number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Yes, Mr. Chair. I think it would be a good idea to send this letter and this resolution to all of our legislative leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| I think, yeah, and on that note, I think there's also two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Besides sending it to our legislative leaders, Mr. McBride mentioned that there is a state association of registers of deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| And, Mr. McBride, I don't want to assume anything, but I'm guessing that you'd want to get a copy of this letter sent to your statewide association of register of deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3267)|
| 0:54:36| to continue to advocate in addition to us individually sending to our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| And if that is the case, would you please make sure our office knows how to get that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| Sure. I believe the resolution directs the clerk to send certified copies of this order to our Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| And, yes, as soon as you all approve this next Monday night, I'll let the Tennessee Register Association know as well as the County Officials Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| And I'm sure Commissioner Schoonmaker will let the County Commissioners Association know as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Very good. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Okay, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Item number 36 is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| approving the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville to enter into a payment in lieu of tax transaction with J.E.D. Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3315)|
| 0:55:25| or its permitted assigns with respect to certain property located at 301 State Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3325)|
| 0:55:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Okay. There's been a motion to approve by Commissioner Gill, and a second has been made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| She's done a really good job on sponsoring both of these pilots that we've got coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| So, Commissioner Gill, I'll go ahead and turn the floor over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| I'm just going to step down front for just some general information for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| Fascinating story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| He made a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| It's a cool story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Good evening, my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| The image you see before you is Cal Johnson, and you were provided history of the Cal Johnson building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| in a small pamphlet that was put together by the Knoxville History Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| compliments of Jack Neely and Paul James, with additional acknowledgement to McClung Historical Collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3391)|
| 0:56:41| the Knoxville City Directories, the New Sentinel, the Knox County Archives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Knox Heritage and the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, and, of course, the University of Tennessee Digital Collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| We wanted to make sure people recognize a prominent Knoxvillian that was born in 1844 and died in 1925.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| Cal Johnson was born a slave, and what is significant is he was part of the McClung family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| which is what the McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee is named after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| He's a prominent businessman and philanthropist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| And on some of the next slides that you will see is the current state of his building for point of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| which is across from Marble Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Two years ago, a plaque was donated to acknowledge his historic contributions to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| and we want to make sure we begin to just look at why this pilot is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| So when we move to the next slide, and I took some additional photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| and what Drew has here, since she has the photos pulled up, is Cal Johnson's existing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| which is in the Burlington community on Speedway Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| And I went by to take these photos because this is his historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| I know in considerable disrepair, and it's part of the home program under the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| It's important because this facility, his home, was moved from Gay Street to a secondary location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| and it ended up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| It is also significant to acknowledge that this house is on Speedway Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| the original racetrack that Cal Johnson started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| The only racetrack, let me say, in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And it is still named Speedway Circle, and it's on the corner of Holston and Speedway Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| Unfortunately, after years of just neglect, this is the state of his property, of his existing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| So I need to acknowledge that this is the second half of it, which probably needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| The house really, just the grounds in itself probably could be maintained as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| but it is part of the city's Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| The additional slides you will see looks at the state of his existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| which is what the pilot will apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| So, oh, look here, Drew is motioning me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| The others didn't load up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| She said the others didn't load up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Okay, well, if you are in your book, here is a copy of what this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| of his existing saloon looks like, which is on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| And I took some additional photos of the building, and I just did various angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| So we really need to recognize, not only was he a successful businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| he helped relocate some of the Confederates where they were originally established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| to move their graves and have them appropriately marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| But Cal Johnson really was a saloon owner, man after my own heart, saloon owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3611)|
| 1:00:21| And unfortunately, Prohibition caught up to him, and we've passed that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| So I think the opportunity to acknowledge him is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| It would be the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| The second thing is he served as an alderman, which probably most people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| And the third thing is that his legacy could be connected to the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| and their development of downtown, which is a significant opportunity for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| and county to restore his building and put it back on our tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Oh, and we have their representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Did I leave out anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| You want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Well, thank you, Commissioner Gill, for your passion for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| I think it's exciting, and it's a building that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| when you think about what a pilot stands for, this is just a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| And thank you, Mr. Dance, for your effort, and thank you to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| and Conversion Properties, Mr. Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| We appreciate your all hard work to bring this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| And, you know, by the way, I recognize public officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| and I failed earlier in the meeting to recognize and thank Bill Lines for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| So thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| We appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Who else do we have from our city here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| We've got Rick Hemet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Oh, that's right, I see Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| And we've got Dawn Michelle Foster, and we've got Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Yeah, I see Todd back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| All right, this motion, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Well, I just wanted to, if Mr. Petrie had anything he wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| I mean, it's kind of a neat deal what they're doing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| Actually, Joe, if you wouldn't mind, we've talked about the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| I think this board believes in the reason for the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| But stepping outside of the pilot, tell us what the project is going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| if you could just share a little bit about the outcome that we're going to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| That would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I'm Joe Petrie, 520 West Summit Hill, suite 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| And Conversion Properties is working as a developer for the Dance family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| who has owned this building for the last 40-plus years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| And these old buildings are just tough to do, but they are worth saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you so much to Commissioner Gill for giving the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| It is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| And we as a company have tried very hard to preserve what portions of downtown we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you, Mr. Anders, for asking about what we're going to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| It's much like what we were able to do with the Taylor Lofts building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| which is at the corner of Gay and Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| They're almost identical buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| That one was four stories with a basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| This one's three stories above ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Right now the windows are boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| They've tried to maintain the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| but at the same time it's so expensive if you don't have a particular new use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Construction costs keep rising, and these old buildings don't conform to the new codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| So that's a formula for high costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| It's a $4.58 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| It's three floors, eight units of residential on two floors above ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| and then the ground floor we hope to be a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| A saloon might be a new idea there, because we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| It takes about five or six forms of financing to do this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| Historic tax credits are involved, a historic preservation grant, a grant from the CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| the pilot, of course, and then private equity from the owners and conventional bank financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| The loan's about $3 million, and so all those other portions add up to about $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| So that's the idea of preserving an old building that just needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| And though they've maintained the roof and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| obviously the costs just keep going up for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| So we'll be basically rebuilding this building from the inside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Putting new steel in, trying to use the floor systems that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| Most of the exterior will be re-tucked and re-pointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| and a lot of repair to the outside, new windows and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| It will be night and day compared to what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| The use of a pilot to preserve the history and legacy of a man like Cal Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| and revitalize downtown is exactly what these programs are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| We agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Well, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Item number 37 is a resolution approving the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| to enter into a payment in lieu of tax transaction with Paramount Hospitality Management, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| or its permitted assigns with respect to certain property located at 210 West Church Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| Knoxville, Tennessee, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Am I point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| We can't vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| Hold on just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| But we move it with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| Why can't it go on consent with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Why can't it go on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| It can't go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| It can't go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| So we should just do it for no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| And officially vote it during the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Just pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| I mean, it's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Just pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I'll entertain a motion to pull that item from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| You do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| You'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| You can do it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Do you want to explain what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| We're just doing a little housekeeping up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| As I mentioned at the beginning of this meeting, this is just a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| Nothing officially counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| Everything accounts at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| So we're trying to make sure that we've had this one properly vetted to get voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| So, yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| And I'm looking to the law department just to make sure that we've got this set forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Yeah, we really need to vote on it next week officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| As long as you remember to pull it off and just vote on it again, that will be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| The next one you might want to do without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| And that way you'll be sure not to have to pull it off and vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| But either way, as long as you remember to pull it off and vote on it again, we'll be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| So the chair will entertain on this next one a motion to consent forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| But I do need that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I would like to do Resolution R-18-12-905 and send with no recommendation to the full commission next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4077)|
| 1:08:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| There's a proper motion by Commissioner Gill and a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Oh, I was the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Sorry, my head's been on a swivel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| I was just going to ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Arthur, did you get the numbers figured out where the property taxes and the county taxes were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| There was a disparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Right now, the current tax bill for Knox County is $9,970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4116)|
| 1:08:48| When the building is complete, which will be in January, we anticipate, that bill will go to twice that for the duration of the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4128)|
| 1:09:00| likewise with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| Now, the figure that keeps throwing us off, I think, is what is estimated will be the appraisal at the end of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4143)|
| 1:09:16| And that is simply an estimate that I think the property assessor gave to the city at the time the pilot was being compiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4156)|
| 1:09:36| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Just going by the $432,000 and how you got to almost $10,000 in taxes, that doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4179)|
| 1:09:48| But anyways, if you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| We know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| I think the IDB and the city knows what we're doing, and the trustee knows what he would be collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4194)|
| 1:10:04| Was the city's portion of the tax correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| That will be in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| And this is the current taxes that are collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| The current taxes are $13,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| For the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| And is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Okay, it's just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| We weren't quite sure how they got to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| The city will be doubled also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| I had three lights come on at about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| The order that I saw them was Anders J. Smith in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| So that's the order I'm going to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| So, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Yeah, my question is for Dr. Lyon, if you don't mind, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| Generally, a pilot is done before the dirt's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| And so, I mean, I don't know how we came to these tax numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| Because, you know, when did the application come through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Oh, gosh, that was probably a year and a half ago at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| So it was the dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| When did city council approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| Gosh, it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Do you have the record of when it was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| It was quite a ways back, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| October 11, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Okay, so why is this one before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| The new law just kicked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Why wasn't this one executed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I mean, it's hard for us as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| I mean, the but for has already been done because it's out of the ground for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| And so what brought this part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| And I know the new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| But why wasn't this executed if it was signed in 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| I think that's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| That's germane to why some of these lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| And I appreciate the opportunity to explain this, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| What happens is a developer, and just being strategic, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| we have X years for which the taxes can be frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| They don't want to freeze them while the taxes are low and while it's being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| So what the practice has been for both this developer and other developers is let's wait to close to we're going to come online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| and then actually close the deal or finalize the pilot, sign the papers with the IDB, between the IDB and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| So city council had voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| IDB board had voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| And then the developer waited, as others do, to closer to the actual reassessment to go ahead and finalize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| so they'll get the full benefit of the years for the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| They did so, of course, all of this strategy was done prior to the change in the state law last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| And that's why this one is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| So if you applied for and it was approved in 2016, I guess you didn't apply for the loan on the pilot loan part of it until recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| Well, the pilot closing is just what happens is there's really not a loan associated with the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| That would be more with the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| What they didn't close with the IDB was the actual, you know, in a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| the property is transferred to the industrial development board and they hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| And they want to wait and do that until right before the property will be reappraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| And what didn't happen was that final transfer of title from the developer to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| That's what they held off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| And when they do that, that's when the clock starts ticking on the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| Had they done it early, the clock would have been ticking for a couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| and it wouldn't have benefited them any because the appraisal would have stayed where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Yeah, I just, I mean, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| I mean, I remember the history of the trade between the three properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and the scent on the city and Cherokee distributing and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| But this one, to see a pilot executed when the building's almost done is kind of, it makes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| I'll tell you what it does is it makes it difficult for us to explain to the public why a pilot's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Well, I think the pilot, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| It's just that the, in fact, the necessity of the pilot and the pro forma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| and all that was done back in 2016 without the assumption they would have to come back later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| That's all what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| And that's what I think the explanation would be was the vetting and the review was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| with the expectation they wouldn't execute it with the board and change title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| until it would, until right before the appraisal would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Did the pro forma include the new rooms that have been added to downtown since 2016?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| You're anticipating the Embassy Suites, the Hyatt Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| You've anticipated all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Well, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| At the time we anticipated continued growth, a couple of those we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| I would say some of them have been, you know, have been the detail we didn't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| but we knew the hotel market was growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| And, of course, we're thrilled to do this and think everybody, city and county government benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| because, as you may have seen in the paper last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| the increase in sales tax just downtown is 50 percent growth of which that's 72 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| which goes straight to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| So, you know, all of that is a great story which we saw unfolding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| I'm not arguing the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I just think it's hard for us to explain to the public that they need a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| which they see, the public sees as a tax benefit when the building is almost open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| It's kind of difficult to explain why somebody gets a pilot and somebody else doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| By approving this, is this a set of precedents of much in which Commissioner Anders was discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| and that other projects that are already undertaking a pilot on the city side are now maybe in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| or finished and can now sort of retroactively go, let's go back to the county too because of the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| Are we opening a Pandora's box of 50 more people that are looking to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| No, I think we have a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| The two tonight, we have one more that hasn't closed yet that Jeffrey Nash is doing that's in slightly similar position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| but his is fully controlled because of the finalizing property transfer from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| It's for property over near Knox High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| That's the only one that could possibly be retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| From this moment on, when anybody comes requesting a pilot, we've spoken to the county administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| and Mr. Caldwell, and we will vet those along with the county as they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| We have no more that have lagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| These are the last two that along with the one remaining that will come up with the state law having jumped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| and sort of gotten people by surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you for the explanation, Dr. Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Mr. Lyons, we've got caught up in a situation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| and I'm going to follow up a little bit with Brad before I go on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| These pilots, they have to close with the IDB and get their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| And what has happened here is we have someone who thinks they got all the approval they needed two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Unlike a lot of these pilot developers do, they did not put a construction clause in their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| that gives them a certain amount of time to build before they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| They didn't build construction time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Some have requested in the past, say, a 15 plus 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| We would have voted on 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Let's say in this case that we didn't, that wasn't built in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| and that's why the general practice is let's actually transfer the property right when it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| which kind of makes sense, too, that you would wait and transfer the property to IDB when it's ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| And so people have got caught up in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| So it gives the impression that we are approving something, a project that by my estimates is at least halfway finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Which is, I mean, at this point we basically have to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| or we're going to put this in a bad situation for everybody, including downtown with a half-finished building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| And you say there's one more of these to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| One more, and that one wasn't so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| That one they really couldn't close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| That will be coming up from Jeffrey Nash because part of his whole project included getting land from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| He was unable to complete that, so he's in a little different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| But these two, we had this one will be the last like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| and then we'll have his coming in whenever he can finalize that, and that's the last of the wrap-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Then the rest will be vetted anew from scratch through both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| Okay, and now to go to a broader discussion on TIFs and Pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Here in the county, we typically use, other than Marble Alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| use our TIFs and Pilots for job recruitment into the county industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| In the city, there's a different objective, and that is the revitalization of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| And you cannot deny that without the TIFs and Pilots that we would not have a vibrant downtown growing like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4741)|
| 1:19:10| And for us in the county who are trying to recruit jobs, that plays a big asset in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| having that downtown being such a place that people want to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Now, it seems that a lot of the TIFs and Pilots you all have given have been for living and playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4762)|
| 1:19:31| By living, I mean residential units and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| And also for playing, restaurants and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| We are getting lower on inventory of land available in downtown Knoxville to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| I hope we get very selective in the types of TIFs and Pilots we go forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| so that we make sure we include that all-inclusive live, work, play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| I would really like to see the city recruit more corporate jobs downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| I know we have, across the river, we've brought Regal, but they really just moved from Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| We brought it, is it to Tomliss? Is that how you say that, Tomliss Group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Tomliss, and they moved from another part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| But I think in order for a downtown to be very vital, it has to have a really good balance of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I think you've got retail, residential, and office, the three legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| And I think the last segment is one we would feel terrific about fulfilling that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| And Tomliss is one that's really helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| They've stayed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| They were offered to leave, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| It's not totally unlike Regal Cinemas, but your point is very well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| By the nature of having these buildings in place and the size of them and the scope in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| they've set the stage to help, as you say, recruit industry and business here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| because that's part of why people want to come to a community, as you pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| But we would love nothing more than to do just what you ask, and we'll continue to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| That would probably entail at this point enough of our office buildings at such a state that it might need a new office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| and that would be fantastic if it would involve a new office building to recruit a company, as you point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| But I think the key to having a functional, vibrant downtown is a good balance and not too much reliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| We've got a lot of hotel rooms coming on, a lot of tourism coming in, a lot of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| I just know that we have a finite amount of properties left that we can do something with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| and I just ask that you all be very selective in what you do with those to make sure they fulfill the function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| All right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I was just going to ask Dr. Lyons how Pilots and TIF basically positively impact Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| but Commissioner Smith answered that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4922)|

| 1:22:05| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I was just going to say, Mr. Seymour, I think we figured out the numbers, so we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| I'll explain it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4934)|

| 1:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Item number 40, discussion of the Knox County Commission legislative agenda for state legislative delegation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=4991)|
| 1:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| This is a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| I know that the legislative committee met, I believe, on Wednesday of this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| And just to bring up, and we also have, for our newer commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| we have three new commissioners that haven't been through this cycle on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| What happens is, you know, we have a lot of things that are very important to us as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| that we want our legislators in Nashville to have top of mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| so that when they are asked the question, what is important to Knox County in the upcoming legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| they'll know exactly what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| So the purpose of this discussion, if we finish it tonight or if we need to move it forward to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| is to identify those top two or three or four items that we are going to formally ask our state legislators to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5043)|
| 1:24:14| for the upcoming legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| We also have on Friday, the 4th of January, a meeting that has been announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| where we'll be meeting for an hour with the Knox County delegation to review these things and reemphasize them with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5062)|
| 1:24:31| So just for our newer commissioners and for the members of the audience, that's to tee up this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| I saw a light flash earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I was just going to suggest that we go ahead and have the discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| because we're going to need to vote at next Monday's meeting in order to have things lined up to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| I'll go ahead and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| We've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Scoon, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Yeah, I was going to go say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Scoon, if you want to open up this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| We met last Wednesday and basically went through and came up with about four items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| that we're going to bring to the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| One of them, obviously, was the proposal from the Register of Deeds to reinstate the full 5% of their fee that they're allowed to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5115)|
| 1:25:28| The other item is we're still going to try to pursue the return of the sales tax administration fee to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| instead of a total phase-out over three years like we tried last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| is maybe compromise a little bit and just go from a 1.18% fee down to a 0.5% fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| and then at some point down the road after that, if we're successful then, to make that whole again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| The other item came through...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| Actually, did you want to address with Judge Irwin and the dependency and neglect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| We'll do that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| And then also was part of our minimum insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| Did you want to address that about how that affects our county and some of the other 95 counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| So those are two additional items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| And then if anyone else has another item that they want to bring to the legislative delegation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| And while either...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| Oh, he just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| If Mr. Anders wants to address the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Yeah, let me back up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Also, each member of the Legislative Affairs Committee is going to take a section of the legislation that comes through Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5207)|
| 1:26:57| We'll have someone in charge of education, jails, general government, transportation, veterans, and those type things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5217)|
| 1:27:06| And then also I'm going to pass around a list of our Knox County legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| with their Nashville addresses and phone numbers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| Yeah, I think the dependent and neglect issue is very difficult to address, and I'll have to meet with Judge Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5240)|
| 1:27:31| I don't know that as a commission, I don't know that we would be the most effective means of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| It may need to come through the Judges Association or some of those folks that are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Because right now Knox County operates about 1,000 kids that are dependent and neglect in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| And so the funding for all that and then what Judge Irwin, the hoops he has to jump through to get these children help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| And he definitely is passionate about helping these kids and frustrated at the process that he has to go through at times to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5277)|
| 1:28:07| But I don't know that that should be one of our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| I mean, we should carry that banner for him, but I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| I'm more concerned with unfunded mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| You know, last year or two years ago there was a new law for 30 more minutes of physical education every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5297)|
| 1:28:26| Well, that caused Knox County to hire 17 new physical education teachers, and physical education teachers are not in BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| And so that's an unfunded mandate, but they told us it wasn't going to cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| And so I think that we really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Two things I think we should really focus on is unfunded mandates and returning money back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| We spend $50,000 a year to find their mistakes in sales tax and issues, and we shouldn't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| It's not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| You know, if they're going to collect the money and charges to collect it, it needs to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| And so getting some of that money, that local money back, because it's kind of hard for them to not talk about funding BEP 2.0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5342)|
| 1:29:14| and talk about roughly a billion dollars in surplus every year for the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| And so I think that's something we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| And I think it's important that our school system and us, the school board has listed some things that they really want to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| a list of six or seven things, and I think we need to pull three or four off of there that we all unanimously agree with, with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| and stand strong with them on that, because that can show Nashville a lot if the commission and the school board agree on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| It helps our delegation go down and fight for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| So I think we need to take that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| And can somebody, Larson, can you get that list to everybody that's on commission, the legislative agenda for the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| Yeah, the joint education committee has not seen that list yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Yeah, we got it at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Oh, is that the final? I thought that was a draft from basement last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| They were working off that. I don't think that was a final. This is what we're going to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Ms. Owens is here that represents my wonderful district, District 2 from the school board, so we'll let you speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| I believe what you have is a draft, because we have not finalized our legislative priorities, but that should happen very soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| and we will make sure you get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Okay, if you can get us those as soon as you all finalize them, that way we, if we can get two, three, or four of those that we all unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| I mean, there's some that we can't unanimously agree on, and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| but if we can agree, unanimously agree on some things, I think that's important to send to the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| So that's my comments about the meeting, and I think it's going to be a very important session that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| there's a lot of new leadership in the state. You've got a new governor, a new house leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and we've got our lieutenant governor back, but, I mean, there is a lot of changes in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| and so we've got to, it's not going to, I still think we should hire a lobbyist to keep up with our issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| because it's going to move, and it's going to move fast, and it's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| So we're going to need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you. I believe it was Commissioner Jay, and then I think we've got Bussler. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| Yeah, just following up on the timeline from a logistics standpoint, if we're, if I heard correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| we are looking to ask this body to vote next week on what our top priorities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| and if, and that discussion is happening now, so if we're going to get information from our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| it needs to happen too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| Well, we may not get, from the school system, we may not get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| I agree with you that it would be nice if two or three of our items were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| if we were on alignment with several things that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| We may not get that until January. I mean, that may be January before they get that done, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| We're invited to the meeting with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| I think they're having a full breakfast with the school, so if we want to get there early before we visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| there'll be an opportunity for all of us to be in the same room at the same time and on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| We've got our joint education coming up December 19th, so they may have something coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| When they talk about voting next week, though, we're really just setting two or three or four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| so be thinking about that, and we'll get those to give them ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| because we don't want to blindside them in that lunch, or whatever meeting we have with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| We want to give them some information, and so be thinking about what you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| and we'll finalize that list next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| You need to speak again, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Jennifer, if you don't care, just state your name and address for our record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| Jennifer Owen, 2217 Fair Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| I think it's fair to guess that those priorities will likely not change very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| They will probably be very similar to that draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| So if that helps to give you some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| I can't speak for the board, but that would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Could you go ahead and send us the draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Have somebody send all the commissioners the draft of where you all are now, and we can start discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| I've got it, and I'll send it, because a lot of them just got it at the legislation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| I handed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Did you send this out, Larson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Did you give this to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| No, because it was in, it's just, that did not come from me, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| We got that at our joint education committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| and when we had our legislative meeting, I just made us all a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| It wasn't anything that was finalized and provided, so we didn't circulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| Okay, it was a draft, but it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Okay, Commissioner Smith, and then I've got Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| I just want to ask Jennifer a question about the priorities, because typically the school system will rank them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| and I just wanted, you know, if they're interested in ranking them, you've probably seen this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| Y'all not going to rank them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| It's just, that's what I want to know, because then we could just see where your priorities lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| When I look at the things that we've got here, you know, the statewide register's fee, the sales tax fee, and the auto liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5656)|
| 1:34:27| The auto liability is, I'm saying that our liability minimum standard of $15,000 is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| The state needs to raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| There's too many people that are driving vehicles that cost more than $15,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and whenever somebody hits you and it's their fault, well, your insurance has to make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| The county itself has lost $45,000 this year by being hit by vehicles that have the minimum amount of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| But these are statewide issues, and I think for us to, I'm not going to say waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| but to use our opportunity to tell our state delegation that we need something to be done for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| and it's simply something that every county in the state should be lobbying their delegates for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| I mean, if we could break this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| They tell us we can bring two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I never really liked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| They're elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| We should be able to come to them with as many things as we think needs to be addressed, should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| So I'm thinking we should break this down into these statewide issues, give them a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| John and our legislative committee work through the state accounting association with their colleagues there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| to push that stuff along with our state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| and then we focus in on some things that are very specific to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| And these two will probably fall into the statewide too, but school funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| that is something that you're not going to get the smaller counties to go fight for us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| because we're one of the big four and we're a donor community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| I think we need our state legislators to help us with BEP formula and the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| I think roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| I know that TDOT is looking to do a lot with Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| We need to make sure that stays on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| and we also need to make sure that they are going to be able to help us someday with Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike, and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| Those are very much important to us for our continued growth in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5781)|
| 1:36:29| We have the growth plan out there that still needs to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| We need to have somebody carry that legislation, whether it's a private act or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| and take care of that for us because it takes away the ability of our Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5799)|
| 1:36:48| that are, what do they call themselves now, the planners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| They changed their name. It's not MPC anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| But it takes away their ability to do proper sector planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| because the zonings don't match up with what they need to do in certain places to provide housing, residential, and commutability like they would like to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5820)|
| 1:37:14| That's just some of my ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Just find the few three statewide things and lump them together and drill down some very specific needs that we in Knox County need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5836)|
| 1:37:26| That's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| All right. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| One of the things I'm a member of is the community television, and the FCC has changed the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5854)|
| 1:37:42| which means that there are some counties that will not have the access to all the channels that they've had now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| because the more channels that you can put on these cable stations, the more money they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| and our service community television is not making any money at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| So the FCC has changed the ruling to take some of these stations away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| and that's part of your education system, too, that you all look at and not only put pressure on what we call our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| but our national levels for letting these, like the FCC, change its rules to where they can take that service away from the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5893)|
| 1:38:25| And when they came in here, they set those up for community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| They said, well, if you'll let us come in here, this is what we'll do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| And then all of a sudden now it's all about their money and what they're using out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| So they're breaking a promise to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| We've got to hold the people that makes a promise to us with their feet to the fire and say, look, you promised it to us, keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| And so we need to also work on that because that's part of your education system, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Maybe Commissioner Smith can find this out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| On the insurance liability and all, do we know how long it has stayed at that particular amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| I was speaking to one of the state legislators and they tried to tell me it was, I'm going to say, six, seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5954)|
| 1:39:25| We know cars have gone up substantially in six, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| If the chair might weigh in on something, I talked to Representative Daniels this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| We talked about a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| One was he was the one who was carrying, I believe, the bill related to the settling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| getting some clarification on the urban growth issue that we've been dealing with as it relates to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| One thing he mentioned, and I asked him to, when we spoke, I said, well, you kind of need us to have some words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=5993)|
| 1:40:01| He said that it would be easier if we had sort of a clear resolution even passed so that the words were clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| It seemed, he said, that it came up almost too late in the session this past time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| and it was difficult to get traction when it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| And I'm not sure if that's our fault or their fault, but I think it was also the communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| on our end, was just not quite clear enough or tight enough to really make it easier for them to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| And he said that he would help, or at least we need to, on that particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| make sure that we pass a resolution and have some tighter language so that it will be easier for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| and his peers in Nashville to understand exactly what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| Secondly, we're also talking about some traffic studies more specific to our district and North Shore community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| We spoke about trying to get a full-range traffic study completed, maybe working with DDOT to try and get that accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6051)|
| 1:41:02| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| I guess I'm piling on to what you had brought up, previous Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| in that I know Representative Daniel is already on it, but we need to make it easier for them to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| Yes, I spoke to Representative Daniels the other day, and there was several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| Our state county association wasn't aware of our objectives, and some of the language was left out and there was conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6081)|
| 1:41:32| It could have been much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| There is also another issue, and I don't know if we can do this as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| or if it takes state legislation to do it, but there has been some concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| and talk about the splitting of MPC into city and county bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| and I was wondering if you guys would like to discuss this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6113)|
| 1:42:09| I don't think that's something we could do in a couple of months and get it into legislation this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| I'd love to have a better process, and if it splits the two bodies, it splits the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6135)|
| 1:42:25| But I don't know if we have something before us that I feel comfortable enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| sending on to the state legislator body right now to get fixed with a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| That's a big deal, and I don't know that we need to do it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Yes, but I see the city is coming up with a recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Their zoning laws are going to change drastically, and at some point it's going to be very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| to sit on MPC and understand two totally different sets of zoning laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| and there's also the issue of representation from the city members for the county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| That is something that I think we could possibly do locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6179)|
| 1:43:07| I think state law allows the board itself to handle that issue, the Metropolitan Planning Commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6187)|
| 1:43:14| or it has to be done by state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| That's the recollection of what I recall, and when I was looking over this a while back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| I'd be glad to look at it for specific detail, but that's what I recollect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| I don't know that you can do it by local legislation because it's a state-created entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| I do think in that statute they do have a method of which it can be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| or dissolved from regional back to a specific board for a specific county or metropolitan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6217)|
| 1:43:46| or change state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| I think that's where we're kind of limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| So do the law allow for new government entities formed within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| such as Farragut, to initially start their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Farragut could start their own, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| They have their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| They can have their own, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| They already do, yeah, by that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| But they didn't join the regional one, which we had agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| and I think the regional one itself has to dissolve within itself or by act of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6248)|
| 1:44:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| I just want to complement this statement and ask the law director this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| because the city is so, in effect, the city of Knoxville has redesigned its own system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6265)|
| 1:44:38| They are restructuring their own system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Will that, in effect, allow us to make a recommendation to change the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6282)|
| 1:44:52| because RECODE essentially has restructured it in itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| RECODE has changed the structure of Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| It's changed the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| So does that zoning implication redefine MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| The rezoning is the jurisdiction within that legal entity of the city itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Just like our zoning is the jurisdiction of this body here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| The implementation of those issues as it relates to a specific project is where it hits the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6328)|
| 1:45:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Any other points on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| You had your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Mr. Caldwell approached the stand, so go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| One thing, and I was going to kind of piggyback off of what Commissioner Schoonmaker said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| about the administrative fee on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| Commissioner Bussler serves on the rail authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| We had a meeting today, first time in a few years having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| So the state is allocating about $32 million to the rail authorities across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| and they're charging, let's see, it's a 5% TDOT oversight fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| It's an administrative fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| That's $1.6 million for an oversight fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| Our total that we're getting was $1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| And so basically that 5% fee is basically 1% less than what we get totals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| But do they ever touch the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Is it funded through TDOT, and TDOT in turn sends it back to the trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| They, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| So we would, basically what they're doing is they're just taking it, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| they're taking it off the top and then paying it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| So they're saying we have an oversight fee, so that's what we're pulling out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| and then we'll distribute the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Okay. But it's coming to their fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| I mean the railroads are paying it directly to them, to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| It's actually like a settlement, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| And so then they're dispersing it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| It's like an excise tax that they're collecting and paying back to the counties for the rail authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| So they're keeping that 5% basically off the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Is that one-time money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| No, it's recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| It won't be that much every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| It's a catch-up provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| It'll be smaller, but it'll still be the 5% and it'll be every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Okay. Commissioner Bussel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| What that was was there was a settlement that the smaller railroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| which we have a small railroad here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| they were paying diesel fuel, tax on diesel fuel, on the price, not on the quantity that they were using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6474)|
| 1:48:04| So it would fluctuate as the price went up, their cost went up, and when the price went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| And what they wanted to do was tax on the per gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| So it was a lawsuit that was settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| It's just like getting the diesel tax or these other taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| It comes in here just like we're doing on our trucks over the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| And it's not that big a deal because it's already figured out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| and then all they have to do is put in a formula to say this amount goes here, this amount goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| And you just, again, push a button once you put the formula in there, and there's really no cost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| The problem of it is to get that money and not let them get used to getting that 5% to go in their general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6521)|
| 1:48:48| so they can say we're trying to fill a hole that we're going to take out by not collecting that from you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| because it went in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| But we collected over $700, what, $3 million in excess tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| but that's enough money to fill a lot of holes if they want to do away with some of these taxes to use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| So we need to get up front on that kind of tax, just like we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| like on the FCC tax and all these other things before they start taxing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| and they get used to that money coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| It's like they're on a drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| When they get extra money in there, they don't want to give it back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| Okay, we're still discussing items that we may want to revisit with our state legislator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| Are there any other items you all would like to put on the table for your fellow commissioners to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6574)|
| 1:49:45| Can you review what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| We have statewide issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| We've got register of deeds, sales tax admin fee, the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6592)|

| 1:50:01| Locally we have unfunded mandates, private act for the growth plan, educational funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6601)|
| 1:50:09| and then I think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6609)|

| 1:50:26| I'll put it on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Yeah, if you want to put that on the form, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| All right, we are, is there any other discussion on this particular item, number 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Discussion item regarding the activity at Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I'm just going to let you all know what happened last year at Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| We had over 52 tournaments that were played there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| That's like one a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| We had, in that time, we had 14 tour events and groups that were played,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| and in 2018 we had eight high schools to use Three Ridges as their home course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6668)|
| 1:51:16| which also saves the school system's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| Also, we had middle schools, which are no longer golf teams that are inside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6680)|
| 1:51:27| They're called club sports now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| We had nine middle schools to use that as a course, too, to give that, to save those kinds of sports money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6690)|
| 1:51:39| But if you look at the 52 tournaments we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| we had over $650,000 in charities' money that was raised by that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6701)|
| 1:51:51| We have a lot of opportunities out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| and next year we're going to have the TriStar event that's come back that's totally registered here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6713)|
| 1:52:00| and nobody can take that tournament away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| It has to do with youth and pros mixed together that brings them in all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| which was a big success last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Also, we have the Eglin's Tour coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| That's the LPGA event coming in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| So you have the TriStar, 1st of July, and then starting on the 18th of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| we have the Eglin's LPGA event that's coming in that's going to bring a big notoriety to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6742)|
| 1:52:33| The thing about it was that course was chosen by the Southern PGA to bring that Eglin's Tour here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| It was nothing that we went out and asked for, but they chose it because of the design of the course and the way it was run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| We've got a good team of people out there that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| You have a good pro that works out there that keeps the things running very well out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| and cuts down on the expenses that are used out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| We could also use that as a tool to bring other people in here, such as businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| because a lot of business was and is being discussed on golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| The thing of it is some people can think about how people get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| but if you can get them relaxed, you can almost sell them anything that you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| We ought to recognize these people that work so hard for us that don't get this kind of recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| There's a number of things out here that we look at and the amount of money that they raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| I found two people that was here in Knoxville that was from overseas, from the East, Asian people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6823)|
| 1:53:53| that were here looking for places to put their business that didn't even have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| didn't even touch base with our industrial development board or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| They were just going around here and they were at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| There's people here that's looking and having a golf course that you can play at that's reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| and also always in good shape, I think is a thing that we ought to recognize those people more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| especially Mr. Brown, the golf pro out there, and also the greens keeper who keeps things in very, very good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6862)|
| 1:54:30| You ought to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| These athletic things that are coming in that we could bring in here to Knoxville could bring us a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| especially in the baseball tournaments, softball tournaments and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| and redoing our properties that the county has, just sitting there, really not generating any income for the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6881)|
| 1:54:51| If you've got your numbers together, we ought to take a look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6891)|
| 1:54:58| OK, are we going to do these baseball and softball fields I think we took a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| and are we going to revitalize some of the property that we have that we can use that's just sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| and really not helping out the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| So, anyway, I just wanted to point that out to you all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| All right. Thank you for sharing that, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| One really quick, I'll get to Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| I was just thinking, so Commissioner Anders will do a quick brief summary on the form regarding that previous discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| regarding the local issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I might ask Commissioner Schoonmaker if you wouldn't mind adding to the form the statewide issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| so that, frankly, as someone who will be getting prepared for the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| I'd like to have the state issues and the local issues in the same place to be able to kind of quickly review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| So do what you said you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I'm basically asking Commissioner Schoonmaker if you wouldn't mind also adding to form a posting with the state issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| or at least get them emailed out to us so that we can have them all handy for Nick to get right over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Well, if you need to, you can add them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| You can add list items that you want to consider, but we need to have a finalized fairly short list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| You've only got a couple of hours with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| I agree. Okay. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| I just wanted to add to what Commissioner Bussler said about the Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| I have the list of all the outings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| If there's any commissioners that would like to know who all is of our nonprofits and our schools and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| if you all would like a copy of this, I'll make sure that Drew sends that out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| I think it's good that we know who is supporting Three Ridges Golf Course in our county, and we can say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6989)|
| 1:56:37| and also may help you all if you're involved or have friends involved to help bring them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| to encourage them to use Three Ridges as their golf tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| And also, a thank you to our Sheriff's Office, who helps us tremendously out there at Three Ridges with their program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7008)|
| 1:56:56| with the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| When they work a day, they get two days taken off of their time, which helps everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7018)|
| 1:57:07| So we appreciate the Sheriff's Office for having this program that works for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7027)|
| 1:57:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Commissioner Skinmaker said he had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Just with the added events that are going to be at the course this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| do we have adequate funding to cover the extra expense for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| It's already paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| These things coming here don't cost you all anything, especially bringing all those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Especially egglings, they pay for it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| We can raise additional monies off the piggybacks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| The TriStar is already paid for by the entry fees and the Southern PGA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| So we're talking about no investment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| We've just got to make it grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| I just want to make sure we're covered, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Before we move to announcements, I'm going to ask if there's anybody from the public who would like to address commission here at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Seeing none, any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| I'd just like to once again invite all of my fellow commissioners to join us at the joint education committee meeting on Wednesday, December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7089)|
| 1:58:18| It will be very timely in our other discussions as the entire meeting is dedicated to school budget 101, where does the money go and why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7098)|
| 1:58:29| and also BEP funding where we have a representative from the state of Tennessee coming to give us a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| So I would encourage you all to attend and join us as we will be getting a vast amount of information about our school system finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7116)|
| 1:58:45| and I think it would be helpful as we go forward with our legislative meeting and as our budget process next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7125)|
| 1:58:53| Wednesday, December 19th at the Andrew Johnson building, 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181210?start=7133)|
