| 1:44:13| We looked at occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Break that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Unoccupied to renter-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| It was around 15% of renter-occupied housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| in the city did not have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| So 85% of the renter-occupied housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| had at least one car or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| So the idea behind that, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| for renter-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| it was about 6%, so it was much lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| So, we didn't look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| kind of more granular or specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| to the area that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| But the overarching thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| while I guess we're trying to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| some flexibility for reducing parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| there's still a level within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| of parking vehicle ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| to the target of renter-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| So, we'll stay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| And owned units as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| So, it's still a significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| it is probably the number one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| we've heard the most complaints about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Is the fact that we've reduced parking 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| That is the number one thing we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| That we should take it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| to two parking spaces per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| And that's the number one thing that we have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| If you add up all of the emails and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| and all of the things, that is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| And even just this week, going out into neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| they're concerned about the impact of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We're having conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| We're explaining all of the great aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| of the details related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| But it is still one of the biggest complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| that we are hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| But doesn't Optico say that the biggest barrier is parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| Actually, they encouraged us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| one per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| And I would say, even our very perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| on this on the team that's been working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| is probably representing the fact that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| thinks something different about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| And you guys as the commission have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| to look at the testing in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| at the standards and stuff that other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| have done in terms of can you make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| And you guys have the capacity to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| and recommendations on the parking aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| of this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Of parking statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Mr. Collins, did you have something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| that you wanted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Did anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Brian, I know that double stacked parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| is allowed in some cases with single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| I've never been able to find in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| when that is or isn't allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Would that be allowed in some of these instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| where you have a 40 foot deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| a little less than that parking stall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| and park two vehicles back to back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6419)|
| 1:47:11| Okay, so we are at 10 to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| How many voters have called their time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| We've almost been here for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Do you guys have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| With the, another thing that I've noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| is this isn't widespread, but in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| there's often an R and three, an R and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| that have different underlay, or not underlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| center planes, like ABR and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| Some of those would not be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| because it's still being an area-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| density calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Some of those would not be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| the same amount of density as would be from in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| So have you all looked at how many existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| R and three and R and four in these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| are not TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| Is that a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| I think about following your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| We have not looked outside of the TDR at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Do you think that in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| I guess the one-year plan would support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| even if someone adds an R and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| with a different sector plan or an R and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| and they wanted to go TDR so that they could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| missing that, or the middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| do you think the one-year plan would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| that change in a lot of these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| We would have to go back and take a closer look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| at the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| It would be very site-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| I can't speak to that wholesale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Yes, that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| So the housing scan that was produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| did look at different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| And so that's really the closest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| that we have to looking outside of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| So there were other areas that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| as potential areas that are walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| or have the potential to be walkable in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| Questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| For parking, it could be fractional as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| You could say half a unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| or half a spot per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| and then it would be less if you build one or this one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| You all can recommend whatever you think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6570)|
| 1:49:38| There's another option too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Parking seems like the big city with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| So how feasible is it for at least a year's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| for the parking to be part of the development's assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6590)|
| 1:49:58| so that it's not something that's mandated by Equality Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| but if you're doing a deflux or anything in the MMH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| that you're working with planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| to come up with a parking plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| that's specific to that development so that there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| I know you're probably going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| we have a job, we're kind of good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| I'm just trying to think about how we get something passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| so that we've got some options for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| because I feel like there is, with good measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| bringing us concerns and accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| There are a lot of specific things that need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| but how do we keep moving it forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| I think that's a good suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| and I understand why you're going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| but from our perspective in planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| we want the rules to be as transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| and easy to administer as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Transparent for our staff, not just planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| but plans review and inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| and transparent for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| so they know what they should expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Should they expect parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Should they not expect parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| And also for anybody who's developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| or redeveloping their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I think it's really important for the rules to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| So I understand we're going to test this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| but I think putting that onto staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| and making that determination on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| I think is outside of our purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| and I would recommend it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| I would say too, from a legally challengeable aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| when we have more subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| we encode generally not for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| because that invites a little bit of challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| I do want to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| regardless of parking as the topic at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| but we had a lot of other topics come up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| and I just want to say that broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| when we sat down for our very first go at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| with the quarantine that Amy mentioned at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| none of us thought this was necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| the final end-all, be-all plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| We all took very seriously to heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| Tony Perez of Octocos, his recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| to create a foundational plan that can be built upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| and that was reiterated to us over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| is really focus on the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| because there are likely to be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Our city is going to look different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| three years from now than it looks right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| and that's not to say that we have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| three years to make more changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| but that's also to say that this has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| a living, breathing, ever-evolving process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| and our code has to function somewhat that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| So I just wanted to say that more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| Yeah, I think that's a good segue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| in terms of thinking about zoning and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| It really does require the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| between a broad community input and community goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| and site-specific impacts, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| we've gotten into a lot of discussion about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| and zoning and land use are just one of our tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| I didn't touch on this in the previous slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| that we can leverage to address housing needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| in our community and affordability challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| We have to remember that zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| often result, actually almost always result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| in incremental changes over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| so the idea that this is gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| the solution, I think Jerome makes a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| is that our community continues to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| and we need to be responsive to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| and make sure that we're being responsive also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| to community goals and our visions for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| so just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| Passing this is not gonna be a wholesale change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| the city's gonna see, but there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| not any zoning change that we could pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| that would be a wholesale change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| I mean, you think about our corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| when we updated the city's zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| we really opened that up to, by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| you could do multifamily all up and down our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| We have not yet to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I think we will in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| but it's again, slow, incremental change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| Again, if there's any other burning questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| we can take another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| We really appreciate y'all's time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| We think this is a really important discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| If y'all have follow-up questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| please feel free to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Linda's already mentioned a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| that she can't send out to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| so we'll be following up with additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6864)|
