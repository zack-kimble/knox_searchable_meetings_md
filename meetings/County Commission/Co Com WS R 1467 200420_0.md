| 0:01:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Would everyone stand and salute our wonderful flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| If you can see it there in my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=105)|
| 0:01:57| One nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Indivisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| With liberty and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| For all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Uh, I realize that, uh, some folks from the public may be watching this meeting for the first time and, uh, most of my fellow commissioners and those who attend these meetings frequently, uh, know I, I realize that every meeting there's always fresh eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=129)|
| 0:02:23| And, uh, the way the county commission operates our meetings, we have two meetings per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| We have a work session meeting, which is normally the, uh, third, uh, Monday of the month, followed by the official board of commissioners meeting, which is going to be the fourth Monday of the month or next week at this work session meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=147)|
| 0:02:41| The purpose of the meeting is to sort of do a first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| Uh, we're going to bring up all the items on the agenda, many of which I've suggested to be placed on a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| A consent agenda means that these are items that will be voted on at one time at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| So we don't have to do a separate vote on every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| At tonight's meeting, we also have a couple of discussion items and presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| So we'll, uh, generally speaking, the work sessions are perhaps maybe just a little bit more informal than the formal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| And, uh, a big purpose of this meeting is once again to consolidate our final agenda for next week's official board of commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| Uh, also a couple other things for those of you may be watching that have an interest in a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| Uh, next week's meeting, we will be handling all of the zoning or land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| It'll be a catch up meeting because we did not have that part of the meeting at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Also, and I'm reminding my fellow commissioners as well as all of our city county team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| We will have three separate zoom meetings to get through next week's Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| We're gonna have a separate zoom meeting for the beer board agenda, which should be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| There's only one item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| We'll then have a zoom link specific to the county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| My goal is to get through the entire meeting agenda before we start the land use or zoning meeting, which will be on a third zoning link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=238)|
| 0:04:06| By doing it that way, there's so many participants at each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| And when we sort of separate them into different rooms, it makes it a little bit easier for Zack and the I.T. team to help sort of manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| So that's what's going on with next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| So moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| I also I know that there's a boy scout who's watching this meeting at home who I communicated with earlier in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| So this is we often have scouts and other folks for civic duty attend our meetings in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| But I do know that Cooper should be watching this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| And I wanted to thank you for joining us and good luck on the citizenship and the community merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| We're glad to have you watching this meeting, though. It's virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| So tell your parents I said hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Moving on. We're now at the part of the meeting where I'll be working with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| We've got to set tonight's agenda. So I did submit a proposed consent agenda on the commissioner's form based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| I know I heard from Commissioner Beeler with one of his items that he'd like to see move forward to when we can have a based meeting in the flesh, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=306)|
| 0:05:15| And are there any other suggestions, changes, additions to my fellow commissioners based off of the consent agenda or anything new that we needed to change or adjust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=315)|
| 0:05:29| Anybody? OK, seeing if I've got any raised hands over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| Well, then what I'll do, I will read off the proposed consent agenda for those who are at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| Also, if you're at home and you'd like to see the agenda live, you can go to if you're watching this on CTV or YouTube, you can go to Knox County Commission and go to at the top of the Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=340)|
| 0:05:53| There's a little bar that says information about commission and then it will say meeting agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| You can click on that and it will say you'll have the work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| If you look at each item that may be coming up, you can click on that and that will then link you back to the actual agenda item with the extra details and paperwork related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=363)|
| 0:06:15| I also know that we've probably got a lot of other elected officials watching tonight's meeting, and I want to thank all of you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| I know Mayor Jacobs is in the audience, is here on the Zoom, as well as likely most of the other elected officials here from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| So I want to thank you for taking the time to join us for tonight's meeting, even if you don't have a particular item on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| I'm also seeing an update here. One additional item that I'd like to add on is a update from Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| So that's one item. Clerk's Office, if you could kind of make a note of that, that will be an additional discussion item that we'll add at the front of the agenda will be an update from Mayor Jacobs on COVID and the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=407)|
| 0:07:02| So what I've got is an add, is a discussion or an update from Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| And as I go through here, I'm going to defer the addition to the library board. Frankly, that's from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| And then I believe there were the other ads, as noted on the commissioner forum, the ads, the deferrals and the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=438)|
| 0:07:27| And, Michael, could you kind of verify that that's the that's that that's the case tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Yes, sir. That's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| All right. Would you. So we have got Dr. Buchanan's items going to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| I'm going to go through these real quick just for the sake of the record. Discussion items will be item 44 and then item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| I'd like to move that to next week. Well, we should have some time at the meeting. Library board appointment will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| Other addition is going to be item 36 as an addition. That's for the new voter, the paper voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| That's basically we add that to the agenda. It will go on to the consent agenda and that's to accept money to help pay for the new voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| It's a should be a no brainer. We also need to add Dr. Buchanan's update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| And then otherwise, if you go down through here, you've got the merit council item, rest of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| Nothing should change. One thing I might ask in Mr. Caldwell or from the mayor's office or parks and rec was item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| If we can confirm that one, if we'd like to have that item heard or we'd like to postpone that item to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| That's the parks and rec item that was postponed last month. But I'd like to get some direction from the mayor's office or Paul, if we'd like to hear that one tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| We'd like to defer that again. OK, so Michael clerk's office, if you could make a note that that one will be deferred another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| And that was late. That was Mr. Caldwell speaking. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| All right. Thank you. The proclamation item, which is item 42, that was proclaiming fair housing month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=546)|
| 0:09:18| Would we like to withdraw that item or postpone that item to made and do that retroactively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| And I'll ask Chris if you could check on that, please. Is that something we'd like to verify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| If the mayor would like to have that one either postponed or withdraw. We can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| I think we can do a while. We do have a day. It's Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| One of y'all talk at a time, please. I'm sorry. I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| OK, now I can't hear anybody. So Chris or the mayor, Mayor Jacobs, if we could get a confirmation on that proclamation regarding fair housing month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| if we'd like to go ahead and move the actual proclamation, those who we need to recognize to May or if that's one that would need to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| Go ahead and defer it as well. OK, that will be a defer. OK, Michael, if you could note that as deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| OK. Otherwise, I think that's the agenda as we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| Could I have a motion for approving tonight's agenda, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| I'm going to approve. OK, that was Commissioner Carringer with the motion. And I'm sorry, who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=630)|

| 0:14:12| Jacobs, you're recognized. Thank you, Chairman. First of all, I'd like to thank Dr. Buchanan, our Health Department, and our health care providers who are doing an outstanding job and working very hard in a truly unprecedented situation. As of today, we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=852)|
| 0:14:32| 193 positive tests out of 3340 tests given. We have 28 active cases. We have 161| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=872)|
| 0:14:44| recoveries, which is great news, and we also are holding steady with four deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| which every, of course, every death is tragedy, but we've been holding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| number for a while now, so that is good news. If you look at the numbers, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| devastating illness for folks who are 65 years of age and older, so obviously it's vital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| to keep our elderly population safe. We have seen tragic, catastrophic results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| when this thing gets loose in a large population of seniors. Fortunately, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=918)|

| 0:15:28| worked with our Health Department to keep their people secure from COVID-19. The Health Department has set up drive-thru testing at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=928)|

| 0:15:57| with private donations, and with TEMA and KEMA. So, as of now, we are well-equipped to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| increasing COVID-19 cases. As you all know, we decided to furlough some county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=964)|

| 0:17:16| be receiving weekly updates from my chief of staff and daily updates from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| the Joint Information Center. If you have any questions or need any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| that you aren't getting, please call me, and of course we'll be happy to provide that, and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| anything you aren't getting and need on a regular basis, let us know, and we'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| our very best to get that to you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs. Does anybody have any particular questions or anything like that for Mayor Jacobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| If you do, raise your hand over on the Zoom board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Okay, seeing none, let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1074)|
| 0:18:04| Next on the agenda, the Chair recognizes Dr. Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Commissioners, for giving me this opportunity to give you a brief update on COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| The Mayor already gave you the statistical update, so I'll skip that part because it hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| But just a little bit about what we're doing. We have a daily call with the City and the County and KEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1105)|
| 0:18:35| just to kind of see where everybody is and what's going on, so that we're all staying informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| The Mayor mentioned our Joint Information Center. In that Joint Information Center, you have the City, the County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| emergency response, just several different groups working to make sure that you and the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| and the media get the information that they need, and we have a unified voice, and that's really working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| As you know, we're doing our daily media briefings. We're not doing them daily anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| We're doing them three times a week now. The biggest workload that we have, though, is case contact and contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| We're doing that 24-7. We have folks who are taking a routine call over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| We have four teams that rotate doing intake on new cases and kind of getting those started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| We're checking on cases and contacts daily to see, one, cases to see if they're remaining in isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| contacts to also see if they're remaining in isolation, and if they've developed symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| We're doing lots and lots of education on symptoms and what to look for and what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| This is going to be the biggest piece that, if our cases increase, this is the piece that we're going to have to really increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| and we have a plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Once we start reopening our community, we know we'll see an increase in cases just because people are going to mix and mingle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| and we're going to have more contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| One of the things that we've noticed is, for our cases, we only have like four or five contacts for each case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| which tells us people are really observing stay-at-home order, which has helped us a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| because people aren't getting out and having 10 or 12 or 20 contacts, so that's helped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| So we have a plan for expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| If you've been to our website, you know that we're providing lots of data to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| We continue to work with hospitals and other providers on surge planning, not so much about ventilator capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| but right now our biggest need is testing supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| So it's the specimen collection kits, the swabs to collect the specimens from people who need to be tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| and the transport media to send it to the lab, and also lab capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| We continue to see what we can do to affect that and continue to look for those supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| through all of our traditional methods of obtaining supplies and additional methods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| We're working really closely with our long-term care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| The mayor and I were talking earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| We're really grateful that we haven't seen significant outbreaks in our long-term care facilities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| That's really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| It's a testament to how well they're working with us and how well they're doing their jobs to protect the folks they're caring for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| So we're really very, very happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| We're also working with others who deal with congregate settings, such as the homeless and the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| all of which are working hard on infection control and testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| And we are increasing our testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| We had such a great response today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| We tested almost 400 people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| We anticipated maybe 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| We may have to cancel some of the testing we had planned for this week, but that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| The more people we get tested, the more we can see what the burden of disease in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| But it also allows us to isolate those folks, connect with their contacts, and protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| In addition to all of that, we are still doing our WIC services, our family planning services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| SCI, childhood immunizations, and a combination of onsite and remote models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| So still working hard on doing those things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So any questions that you have for me about COVID-19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1330)|
| 0:22:22| Dr. Buchanan, this is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Since we opened up public works and engineering, how many tests did we do there today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Do you have that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Yes, sir, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| It's between 300 and 400, and I don't have the exact number in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| But I know we thought it was going to be 400, but it ended up becoming a little less than 400 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| Are we testing everyone now, or just you still have to have the symptoms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| We are testing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| But I'll be honest, due to our limited supplies, and not just our limited supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| the whole medical community is challenged with the testing supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| We would really prefer that people who have symptoms and people who are healthcare workers who have had an exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| we'd prefer to test those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| We're not turning anybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| But, you know, if you're not symptomatic, you know, maybe wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| You know, just because you have a negative test today doesn't mean you don't get COVID-19 tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| So if you're not symptomatic, we honestly prefer that you continue to do social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and washing your hands and being careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And we would like to target folks who have symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| We also encourage folks to call their doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Some doctors are testing, not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| You can find a list of places you can get tested actually on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| KGIS has been a great partner to help us do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Commissioner Carringer, then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Dr. Buchanan, I was wondering with the engineering and public works going back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| how are we in terms of masks or what are we doing to prevent any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| Because I know the hospitals and all are still very, very low on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| So I didn't know what the county was issuing as far as what to do to try to, you know, do the distance and to keep away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1457)|
| 0:24:27| So my staff has adequate PPE supplies right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Engineering and public works staff don't really need PPE because of the type of work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| And our hospitals have received supplies through the strategic national stockpile, as well as other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| All of those have been delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| What they're doing is conserving their supplies right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| So they're limiting who can have them so that they can conserve them, which is smart, because when we have a surge event, they're going to need those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1492)|
| 0:25:01| So they've changed how people can access supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| And one of the reasons we canceled elective surgeries was to help with PPE supplies, and that's worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| So we're being very conservative with our use and we are being very conservative with our use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Our methodology for testing really limits the amount of PPE that we're using so that our staff is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| The people are protected, but we're minimizing the use of PPE because we all know we have to make it go as far as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you. Got your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Commissioner Carringer, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Patients still do not have masks and all at a lot of the places and even in the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| Was that a question? I'm sorry. Was there a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Yeah. I mean, how are they in terms of patients and in the hospitals and also in the facilities in terms of rehab and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| They still have no mask. So the hospitals all have their inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Those are great questions for the hospitals. They make decisions internally on how they use masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| We don't have any determination in that. We determine how we use masks internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| We certainly work with them on those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| And as you can imagine, giving a mask to every person who comes in the facilities is a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| So they are talking about that actively as they think about increasing back to a more normal levels of elective procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| They're looking at what's possible. Can they get masks that are cloth masks for for patients to wear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| That would be some prevention so that they don't use the medical mask on the patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| So those are conversations being had by the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| All right. Thank you. Michelle, is that got your question completely answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Commissioner Carringer. OK, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| Chair recognizes I've got Commissioner J. Smith and Gil have all got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| So, Commissioner J. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Dr. Buchanan, do you have a I know you won't have an exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| but do you have a general sense of the percentage of those who showed up for testing today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| Were they what percentage were symptomatic versus a majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| I have no idea. I wasn't present at the testing. I don't have any of that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Literally, my staff wrapped up at three thirty four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| So I don't have any. I have a number is all I have at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| So we'll look at that later. Sorry. Don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| No, that's fine. You sounded you said you and your staff sounded fairly surprised that you thought you might have 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| But 400 showed up today. Does that concern you that more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, most I would I would assume that a lot of people that will go to get test or are going for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| Now, you never know. But I mean, is it concerning that you have 400 people line up on day one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| That seems it seems high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| And what does that tell you about maybe how many people are sick in our community or will you not know until tests come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| Right. I'm not sure it's an indicator how many people are sick in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| I think it's an indicator in the people believe getting a test is is going to tell them it is going to tell them if they have covered 19 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| But it's not going to tell them if they're if they're negative today, they could be positive in two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| So I think people believe if I get tested today, then I'm done. I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| So they come in and get tested and they don't have to worry about getting covered 19. And that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| I am concerned that a lot of those folks were were asymptomatic and that that will have a lot of negative tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| And we use a lot of supplies for that. But we have to we have to figure that out based on phone calls that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| The majority of people, because before, you know, we were really limiting the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| And based on phone calls, we got the we weren't turning people away or symptomatic, but we were certainly turning people away or asymptomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| And there were lots of asymptomatic people wanting to be tested. And there's a lot of uncertainty with this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Are there really asymptomatic cases? I don't think we're sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| OK. And just to confirm the tests that you all are offering doesn't have anything to do with antibodies or to find out if you had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| if you had covered 19, you know, two days, two weeks or two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| It's purely a are you active with it today? Test sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| It's a test for the protein of the virus. So you're going to have the most of those present when you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| But you will have some of them, some of the protein later, even after you're well, if they're not live virus, they're dead virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| And you can still pick that up. So it doesn't tell us what you're asking is, does it tell us if you're immune?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| And even the antibody tests that are out there don't really tell us if you're immune because they haven't been validated and they're not for patient use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| And then one just last question. Could you can you please just reiterate how long you will be doing this testing and when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| And I know we've all said it's at the Engineering and Public Works on Baxter, but just so everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Sure. Our goal is to do this testing every weekday, 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and going forward as long as we have supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| But because we had such a great turnout today, that may have to be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| We may have to alter that schedule as supplies allow. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| All right. Thank you, Mr. J. Next, Mr. Smith and Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to thank you, Dr. Buchanan and your staff for all the hard work you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| I really appreciate it. I have just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| We are currently under a safer at home order that allows people to go out for essential shopping needs with the people we are testing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1857)|
| 0:31:07| Are we instructing them to self quarantine and not go out in public until they get the test results, which I understand could take four to six days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| Absolutely. Everybody who gets tested, whether you get tested by us or tested by your doctor, you should remain in isolation or quarantine until your test results come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1875)|
| 0:31:25| And everyone is instructed to do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, Mr. Smith. Mr. Gil. Mr. Gil, your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1891)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you. Can you hear me now? Yes, ma'am. OK, so this is really a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| So as people come through the drive through to get their test process, are we giving them information to how are people understanding they're going to be positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1907)|
| 0:32:00| Do your staff give information to people who come through and get the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| So the process is that they come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| There is a little bit of registration done where we collect some information on the person, demographic information, contact information, symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| We'll do as quickly as we can obtain the specimen and that's sent off to the lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| And then the patient is given instructions in verbally and in writing on what they're to do afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| And we will contact them when we get the results back, be they negative or positive, to notify them of the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| OK. And my other question is associated with your demographics and data we're collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| We know which we I guess we don't have the data as of yet to determine where they are located in the county coming through that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1968)|
| 0:32:59| We don't have that yet. I mean, we collected it, but we haven't had time to do anything with it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| OK, because it was who is covering the cost associated with the testing that we're giving to the general public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| The county is currently covering the cost of the plan that we will ask for reimbursement through FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| OK, that's that's where I was going with that. And also, is there any opportunity to extend additional sites or is that the public worksite the only spot we're going to be focused on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2000)|
| 0:33:34| So that's going to be our weekday operations spot. We are looking at and again, it's dependent on supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| We are looking at possibly being able to do some surge type events on the weekends and different locations in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| And as you and I talked, we looked at our testing. We haven't tested anybody from that 37915 zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| So, again, looking at something near there or in that zip code that would accommodate a drive through style testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| OK, what is our next step? OK, OK, that's I mean, that's that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| And I appreciate your assistance in identifying a spot over in this district so we can help deal with some of the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| Yes, ma'am. Thank you. OK, thank you. Good question, Mr. Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. B, thank you again for all that you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| Forgive me if this is repeat information from either you or the mayor, but I just wonder if out of the confirmed cases in Knox County, do we know how many of those are health care workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2071)|
| 0:34:45| We are not sharing that level of information about the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| OK. All right. Thank you. Are there any other questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2091)|
| 0:35:02| I'm not seeing any other hands up. Dr. B, I also do want to thank you for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| And it just goes without saying. And, you know, you know, hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| You know, there's still a lot of hard work ahead and we appreciate your availability and doing your best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| So thank you. Thank you for your support. And I am going to I'm going to sign out because I think my things are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| If the chair is OK with that. Yes. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Yeah, that's fine. Two items on the agenda and they're both on have remained on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you. All right. Thank you. Moving next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| What I'd like to do is we do have one other kind of presentation and discussion item that I actually had sort of a preview of some of this information this past week with Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2141)|
| 0:35:52| I'd like to move on to the community development presentation on the Knox County consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| I know that some of the very detailed minutiae specifics are may still be getting finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| But when I spoke with that department this week, number one, it's an important plan for affordable housing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| There's also certain elements in this that actually are related to covid funds and care care act funds that could help some of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2172)|
| 0:36:21| So I believe I'll open that up. So to the community development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| So, Dwight, could you introduce your team here on this? And Dwight, how are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| You know, just because this is a digital media doesn't mean I can't see how I know you kind of hurt your paw, your foot there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| So I hope you get better soon. Chairman, I apologize to the commission for coming from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| I was actually going to duck in to the office for today's presentation. It gives us the benefit of having our files and everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| But unfortunately, I stepped off my tractor awkwardly Saturday and dislocated my foot and broke my ankle in two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2216)|
| 0:37:08| So surgery is pending on Wednesday morning and be out for a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| And then the next time you see me, I'll be going up and down the hall with one of those little carts that you drag your leg behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| But we've got we've got the staff online here and we also have our consultant and we're anxious to move the consolidated plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2243)|
| 0:37:33| For those of you that have not been through this before, HUD requires us as a participating jurisdiction to submit a five year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| This plan is from 2020 to 2024. It includes elements such as a strategic plan for housing and reducing housing insecurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2260)|
| 0:37:50| It includes a citizen participation plan and it includes an analysis to impediments to fair housing and some related documents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| So we've got on the line Jenny Holden, who's our senior program manager for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| We have Ian Christie, who's our grants program manager and frequently our point person on all matters HUD related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| And then you've seen a lady Kate Molinaro. Kate is coming to us, I think, from Pittsburgh currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| Kate works with the firm of Muller and Lonergan and they have done a great job consulting for us and putting the plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| This is a five year plan. Within it is also what's called an annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| So you have five years in a consolidated plan and then each year has an individual annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| So this is both a consolidated plan that's for five years and then the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| So if it's a pleasure of the commission, I'll let Kate go through the presentation and then we'll come back to the funding COVID-19 CDBG funds that are also pending as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2321)|
| 0:38:56| But I just encourage you to think of this plan as our conventional five year plan that we would come to you with to promote affordable housing and reduce housing insecurity in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2336)|
| 0:39:06| So with that, I'll I'll hand it off to Kate and then we'll come back around to the COVID funds if that's OK with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| Sounds good to me, Dwight. Thank you. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| And thank you for allowing me to take some time to talk with you. As Dwight said, as a condition of receiving the CDBG and home dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| the county goes through a five year planning cycle to outline needs, goals, objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| and then a road map for how to spend the dollars that the county gets annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| I'd like to go over quickly just the planning process that we've undergone to date. In early February, me and a colleague were in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2381)|
| 0:39:50| Those stakeholders, including housing developers, housing service providers, economic development agencies, social and health service providers, as well as homeless service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2390)|
| 0:40:02| We also, in February, conducted an in-person public meeting to generate feedback on the needs and priorities for the county for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| And then last week we held a public hearing last Wednesday via video conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| A variety of stakeholders were also in attendance there. We conducted an online survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| This was distributed via Survey Monkey on the county's website, on social media channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| And really, this was intended more for residents than stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| And we wanted to get into what the residents of the county identified as high priority needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| And these were things like affordable housing, homeless services, public improvements, and other public and social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| And what we did was use all of the information that we generated over the course of those stakeholder sessions, the survey, and then just conversations with the county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2448)|
| 0:40:58| And we developed a list of priority needs and goals for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| And those needs that we identified were increased affordable rental housing, increased home ownership, improve the existing housing stock, provide public services, provide homeless housing and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2462)|
| 0:41:14| And then we added later in the planning process, as a result of the coronavirus, provide support for pandemic response and recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2474)|
| 0:41:24| And so those needs were refined into five-year goals, as well as annual goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2484)|
| 0:41:33| And the annual goals that we selected for 2020 for how the county will spend its dollars were increased access to and quality of affordable rental housing, provide infrastructure to support the creation of affordable housing, provide home rehabilitation assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2493)|
| 0:41:49| increase home ownership, provide homeless housing and services, provide services for the elderly and disabled, provide health services, provide services for LEP persons, limited English proficiency persons, and then again, provide facilities and services in support of the pandemic response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2509)|
| 0:42:06| As you might be aware, the county is getting $1,207,000 in community development block grant and $430,441 in home investment partnerships programs funds to fund activities that will meet those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2526)|
| 0:42:25| And so in 2020, the proposed activities that the county selected are supposed to include health care services, home prevention services, homebuyer counseling and foreclosure prevention, services for seniors and limited English proficient persons, home repair programs, rental housing development programs, and a homebuyer program to be undertaken by Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2545)|
| 0:42:48| All of these details are outlined in the plan that's on public display right now. It's available on the county's on the community development web page for public comment and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2568)|
| 0:43:00| And then we will, I think this will be before you at your meeting next week. So I'd be happy to answer any questions on the process on how we develop these priorities, how we're proposing the funding to work for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2580)|
| 0:43:16| I've got a question. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the Habitat for Humanity program that y'all are working on? I mean, if you could elaborate just a little bit more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2596)|
| 0:43:26| Sure, I can. I can tell you what I know. And then Dwight or his staff can elaborate. So the county conducts a competitive application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2606)|
| 0:43:38| The distribution of these dollars, and as I understand it, Habitat for Humanity submitted an application, they are proposing a 35 unit townhome development. This would be for percent homebuyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2618)|
| 0:43:53| And the CDG dollars are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| You're sounding a little cattywampus here. You're sounding a little funky. Maybe either get closer to the mic or try something different. You're breaking in and out. So start again, please, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2636)|
| 0:44:07| Sure. So the county, the community development office issues an RFP every year for funding. So they solicit applications from agencies that are interested in getting funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2647)|
| 0:44:20| As I understand it, Habitat submitted an application for a 35 unit townhome development. This would be homeownership units for sale to first time homebuyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2660)|
| 0:44:30| And it's my understanding that the CDBG dollars are to be used for infrastructure for that development. So roads, sidewalks, some offsite infrastructure, and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2670)|
| 0:44:44| Sure. Can I jump in, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Yes, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you. So just to follow up on what Kate had said, we as an agency had been out of the single family housing space for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2688)|
| 0:44:58| Our dollars have gone into permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless veterans. That's a facility on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| We've put significant dollars into affordable housing, affordable rental housing for low to moderate income seniors, but we haven't worked in single family for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2707)|
| 0:45:19| And one of the things we need, if you'll just, you know, on a Sunday, you flip through the real estate ads, that sort of thing, and you'll see entry level commercial homes in the Knoxville market now, Knoxville, Knox County, are $220,000 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2719)|
| 0:45:34| And that is far outside the reach of a low to moderate income family. So Habitat had a proposal they are trying to get not away from, but they're trying to expand on their model of individual lot level building and going to subdivision level building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2734)|
| 0:45:51| So they own a piece of property east, I believe it's Commissioner Buehler's district, that is residentially zoned, and they're actually proposing to do 35 single family owner occupied homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2751)|
| 0:46:04| Our goal with the development like this, as it always should be, is that you just drive into it, and this is the case with our senior housing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| And it simply looks like any other subdivision. So these will be built over a period of about three years. They'll be owner occupied, and upon completion, they'll have an appraised value of between $155,000 to $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2772)|
| 0:46:27| And absolutely nobody anywhere in Knox County, Tennessee is building single family housing in that price range. Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| So it's a great project. Habitat brings a buyer, a home buyer that has been heavily invested. They typically had about a year of home buyer readiness training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2794)|
| 0:46:46| They have to contribute sweat and financial equity, and they're better prepared and better suited for homeownership than somebody that might just randomly be the beneficiary of some financial assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2806)|
| 0:47:00| I think their foreclosure rate is less than 5% comparable to or better than commercial market housing. So that's the effort to get back into single family space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2820)|
| 0:47:13| We'll continue and want to continue to work in affordable housing for seniors. We've got a project going in Commissioner Anders' district now, an expansion of a very successful project there, continue to work in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2833)|
| 0:47:26| And as dollars allow, we'd like to continue to work in housing for veterans as well. But this was a first step to get back into the single family lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2846)|
| 0:47:36| The other thing that might be a little bit different from past plans, and just give this a sideways glance, but I think it's space that you can look for us to work in more, and that is just traditional homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2856)|
| 0:47:51| Homelessness has traditionally been considered sort of an urban center issue, and the city of Knoxville, Michael Dunthorne, in the continuum of care to a fine job, and managing as best as anyone can the problem of urban centered homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2871)|
| 0:48:10| But that landscape is changing. We are receiving more and more reports, for instance, from the library system for issues with negative encounters between library patrons and homeless persons in branch libraries in remoter and remoter locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2890)|
| 0:48:26| We are hearing reports and seeing reports in staff meeting of more and more encounters similarly with homeless persons and patrons that are using greenways and park facilities that are in remoter and remoter locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2906)|
| 0:48:40| And so we may, over the next five years, look to work in that space a bit as well, and see what we can do to serve the homeless population that is in the county balance in a way that's productive, particularly getting them connected to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2920)|
| 0:48:59| Ultimately, obviously, everybody's goal is to take the unsheltered homeless and make them sheltered, and that would be our goal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| It's just a little bit more difficult to the landscape when you have somebody who's homeless, and they're in Gibbs or they're at halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| Anecdotally, they tend to be a little bit more service resistant, so a little bit more work has to go into trying to get them connected to services and agencies that can give them some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2954)|
| 0:49:26| So that's just sort of a general overview of some of what we're thinking about for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| At this point in the presentation, any of my fellow commissioners have a question for Dwight or his team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| Okay, I see some hands up. I see Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Gill, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and we appreciate the work of Dwight of your team, because I was going to speak to the issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| But could you also touch on the issue of when we speak of affordable housing and affordable housing units, what that looks like in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=2995)|
| 0:50:07| What is the cost burden for people to live in Knox County? What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| Well, the area median income is $66,600 for a family of four. So if a household is at 80% or below of that, then they are considered low to moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3014)|
| 0:50:31| And there are a lot of families. I couldn't quote a number. Unfortunately, I'm working from home and office, so I can't give you a hard number. We'll be glad to follow up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| But there are a lot of families that meet that profile. So there are a lot of families where affordable housing is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| It's not an exaggeration to say that nationally, it is nearing crisis proportions. I don't think our market is that tough yet, but our market is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3047)|
| 0:50:57| The reason I bring that up is because I wanted to know which districts that has the greatest impact in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3057)|
| 0:51:07| I think it affects every district. It may disproportionately affect census tracts. We also look at census tracts as much as we do commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3067)|
| 0:51:18| And so obviously that's a slightly different landscape, but we certainly have census tracts across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3078)|
| 0:51:28| I think every district has some challenges for either there are a lot of families that meet the economic profile or because of high land values, there's a really acute shortage of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3088)|
| 0:51:41| Sort of two sides of the coin, you have places where the working families that live there are low income families, or you have places where there's a fair amount of affluence, but as a consequence, affordable housing is extremely scarce and hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3101)|
| 0:51:54| And the reason I bring that up is because, could you touch on our community partners that you're working with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| And if we have any data from the last five years as to the community partners that we have dealt with, and where's the data point that the work that they have done for the last five years have met what the county is requiring of them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3120)|
| 0:52:17| Sure. One of the things, as I mentioned earlier, you have an annual action plan that is a roadmap for the 12 months upcoming, which has numeric metrics of measurement as to how many families are going to be served and what the goals of those agencies are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3137)|
| 0:52:34| And then at the end of the year, you have what's called a CAPER, Comprehensive Annual Performance Evaluation Review, and the CAPER is a bookend. It looks back at the year. So you have an annual action plan and a CAPER. And now I'm talking with my hands. I'm sorry, but you have an annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3154)|
| 0:52:49| You have no volunteer families or built a number of units or done what they are supposed to do. Most of the time, we think they set realistic goals and they achieve it every now and then. You will run into, particularly if you've got any kind of construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3169)|
| 0:53:12| Those are where if we get into another year where it's difficult and we're unable to complete a project and we have to roll it into the next year, it often centers on the fact that construction is an issue and somebody was unable to complete a project. Hard numbers. And again, Commissioner, I'm at home. I'd be glad to follow up with you maybe Friday because my surgery is Wednesday. So I think Wednesday and Thursday, I'm pretty much out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3192)|
| 0:53:38| Also, Jenny Holden and Ian Christie are both available too. So anything specific you might want to ask, I'd be glad to. Our biggest partner overall is CAC with the emergency home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3218)|
| 0:53:54| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Dwight, you froze. Just go back to where you're saying CAC was a partner and then start from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Am I good live again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| You're live. We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| CAC is our biggest partner financially with the emergency home repair program. One of the things you'll hear us say often is the most affordable place to house somebody is the one where they already live. And so we will have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3247)|
| 0:54:24| We can't... I can't hear you. You froze. You're still frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3264)|
| 0:54:37| Oh, man. Any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Yeah. Is that you, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Dwight, we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| It is. In fact, let me... Or Ian can pick up if they've got a better signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| Perhaps. And where it was left was you just said one of the most affordable places for people to live is where they're currently living. I think that was where you were in your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| So if Ian wants to close with that on this and then we can come back to you again on the CARES Act funding on that. That might bring some closure to this discussion unless any of my fellow commissioners have any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3300)|
| 0:55:14| Well, my question was about the CAC funding because the wait list is so long. And if we had dedicated additional resources to dealing with some of those concerns. But I'll just touch base because I guess the feed is now terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3314)|
| 0:55:30| No, ma'am. I'm here. Zach gave me guidance to drop my video to see if that helps some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So did that help some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Yes. But I just didn't hear the answer regarding CAC. So I'll just follow up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| Sure. That sounds good. I did want to say also our biggest partner for housing the last several years has been HomeSource Tennessee. And they've got projects in your district, Commissioner Anders' district, principally serving affordable housing for seniors, but other populations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3347)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| All right. Very good. Dwight, one piece of that, and Commissioner Gale, is your question answered or at least where it is? I know you're going to follow up with Dwight afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| I'll just follow up afterwards because there was a specific question, but I'll just send him a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| Okay. Very good. Dwight, I know that you also wanted to, as part of this, to share an update on some of the CARES Act funding and how it might translate into some help for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3386)|
| 0:56:36| Yes, sir. I assume there might be some interest in that, and there's an awful lot of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| One of the consultants that Finance is working with had made the statement on a call we were all on last week that federal government is building this plane as they fly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3402)|
| 0:56:54| But one set of funds that are coming to Knox County are COVID-19 CDBG funds, and these are funds for our current program year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3414)|
| 0:57:06| We're going to receive, in the neighborhood of $710,097 in gross funds, Community Development Block Grant funds, specifically for COVID-19 relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3426)|
| 0:57:19| In our early conversations with the mayor, we talked about using these funds for an expansion of short-term rental and mortgage assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3439)|
| 0:57:31| That is still under discussion, but that, from all that we hear in the social service agency meetings, is really, really a critical need for the affected families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3451)|
| 0:57:43| especially those that have worked in businesses that have been shut down as a consequence of the pandemic, those that are working in service industries and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3463)|
| 0:57:53| So we are looking at those funds potentially being used for short-term rental or mortgage assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| A couple things to remember about these funds. These are HUD funds, and so they are subject to, although a slightly altered framework, they are still subject to conventional HUD restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3479)|
| 0:58:10| There is a public notice period, or a public notice requirement, excuse me, there's a public notice or public comment period following the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3490)|
| 0:58:20| And then the funds still have to be used in a manner consistent with meeting one of HUD's three national objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| And the principal one there being serving low- to moderate-income families, so I'm confident that we'll land in a good place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| We've also talked briefly with the mayor about some form of small business relief program, but our funds are so limited, we're not sure yet whether or not that is viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3516)|
| 0:58:46| But those are funds that are on the books. We should be able to start spending those funds this summer, and we think that they're not unlimited, but they will bring some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3526)|
| 0:58:58| We've also been in contact with our counterparts at the city. I spoke to Becky Wade, who's my counterpart at the city, earlier this week, just to confirm what direction they're going in and what they're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3538)|
| 0:59:11| They're hearing exactly the same thing we are, that short-term rental assistance, short-term mortgage assistance is really critical to keep people in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| And I know this commission has heard discussion that there will not be evictions during a 60-90-day period, and while that is correct, one of the things that I'd ask you to remember is the rental or mortgage liability continues to accrue to that homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3560)|
| 0:59:38| So if you have a low- to moderate-income homeowner and you defer them paying their rent for three or four months, you avoid eviction during that time, but at the end of it, they're going to be left with an unmanageable liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3578)|
| 0:59:52| And so I think that these funds may be able to help offset that. Otherwise, we would just be kicking the can down the road, so to speak, in terms of evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3592)|
| 1:00:02| So I am not as up-to-speed as Mr. Caldwell is, Director Caldwell is, on the rest of the CARES Act funds, but we have been staying close to the COVID-19 CDBG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3602)|
| 1:00:15| All right. Thank you. Thanks for sharing that. Any other questions for Mr. Vandiver? Okay, seeing none, we can move back to the regular part of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3615)|
| 1:00:32| I think the next item on our agenda was a motion for approval of the minutes of the previous meeting. If I could get a motion and a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| Nothing big. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| All right. We have a motion from Commissioner Biggs and there's a second from Commissioner Anders. Madam Clerk, would you please have a roll call vote for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3641)|
| 1:00:55| Commissioner Gill? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Commissioner Gill votes aye. Commissioner Carringer? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Commissioner Carringer votes aye. Commissioner Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Commissioner Smith votes aye. Commissioner Nystrom? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3666)|

| 1:01:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye. Commissioner Anders? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Commissioner Anders votes aye. Commissioner Besseler? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Commissioner Besseler votes aye. Commissioner Baylor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Commissioner Baylor votes aye. Commissioner Daly? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Commissioner Daly votes aye. Commissioner Jay? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Commissioner Jay votes aye. Commissioner Biggs? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Commissioner Biggs votes aye. All members voting aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Okay. Thank you. It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Okay. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| I think is that item 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Yes, item 25. On page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, authorizing submission of an application for the Tennessee Department of Transportation Litter Grant Program for fiscal year 2020-2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3714)|
| 1:02:07| And if said application is approved, authorize Knox County to enter into a grant contract for the acceptance of the grant award in the amount of $168,600, no local match required, resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3727)|
| 1:02:20| No local match required, resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you. I was the one who pulled this, but can I get a motion for a motion first before we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| Motion for approval from Commissioner Daly and a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Discussion, who from the administration will be talking to this one? I just, it seems like we, we often talk about trash and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| No, you can read if you want to and I'll do the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Okay. Angie, if y'all could mute your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| But who from Solid Waste is going to just kind of provide us a little bit more details and be available for questions. And if you're there, just call in or speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3767)|
| 1:02:57| This is Drew Thurman, the director of Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Okay. Thank you, Drew. Drew, could you just give us kind of a quick for both the commission and realize you're speaking to the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| Just sort of a brief update on what this litter grant program is and what it will help accomplish. And then there may be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| Sure thing. It's a program that dates back to the 80s where the Tennessee Department of Transportation made some funds available. I believe it's from the tax on the beverage industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3793)|
| 1:03:27| And they made the funds available to counties based on how many miles of road, county roads, county and state roads they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3807)|
| 1:03:37| And essentially that program is sent in the form of a grant from the Department of Transportation Highway Beautification Office for counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3817)|
| 1:03:49| And there are some requirements like education. So 35% of it has to be spent on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| But the rest of it is it's essentially what it is a program to remove litter off of the side of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Primarily county roads or roads that touch state roads. And the county, Knox County has a, the grant fluctuates from year to year based on how much money is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3842)|
| 1:04:15| The past couple of years is relatively stable at about $168,000. And again, 35% of that is for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3855)|
| 1:04:26| No grant, no match is required, though, even though that match is not required. We do have a supplemental amount of money we spend because we've citizens and commissioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3866)|
| 1:04:38| Grown to expect a certain level of service for litter and we, you know, we want to have a robust litter removal program. So we do add a little bit of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3878)|
| 1:04:49| County dollars to the program. But I would say is we always use the litter grant first and charge off anything we can. So our goal is to, you know, not as not use as much tax dollars as we save as many tax dollars as we can and draw that down that the grant amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3889)|
| 1:05:11| First and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Regarding why it's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Two reasons. One is the the T dot requirements for the application have almost always required a like a, an authorization from the local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3916)|
| 1:05:27| That gives us permission to apply for the grant that way July one when it goes affected. It's already approved. So it's like a pre approval and second, they've actually waived that this year in the wake of coven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3927)|
| 1:05:39| But our charter also states that, you know, money's received by the county must be approved for Commission. So even though they've waived that as a grant requirement. It's still a requirement of our charter. So it's before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3939)|
| 1:05:56| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| This is interesting. So if you could just kind of share a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Yeah, sure thing. So it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| There are several. There are five different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Target groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| The general population. So that's they break it down in terms of target groups and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| One of the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Are long standing partners with the Tennessee Department of Transportation's little grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| Is keep America beautiful keep Tennessee beautiful and we have a keep not so beautiful is the local affiliate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| And the way it works is the we actually contract out that portion. So whatever the grant portion it is, it's going to go to the local affiliate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=3994)|
| 1:06:43| And they do a variety of things. They host like trash runs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=4003)|

| 1:29:39| And the motion from Commissioner Anders is to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5379)|

| 1:31:20| So it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| We can move it to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| And then as we get closer, if it looks like May is going to happen in a normal setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| we can keep it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| If not, we can move it to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| I've also got to recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5490)|

| 1:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| We're going to have to have a public hearing on this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| Since it's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| This is just formality that we need to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| and hopefully we can have this ordinance meeting next in May, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| This will count as the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| And then, yes, we'll work to get it rescheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| get a public hearing scheduled for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| If we're not going to be able to have a public meeting in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| then we'll move that to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| So we'll have a second reading in June as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I'll second, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| All right, I've got multiple hands here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| All right, I've got Commissioner Smith to recognize, then Anders, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Two questions of procedure for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| First, since this is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| don't we need to pass this with no recommendation onto the regular voting meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Second, since this is a zoning ordinance, I think I may be getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| I know ordinance and zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| one of them does not require two votes or a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| I'll say that again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Do zoning changes ordinance require two meetings and a public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5733)|
| 1:35:46| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| I'll have to look and give you affirmative next week when you do vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| But I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Okay, so I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| For no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Okay, was the second from Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5767)|
| 1:36:07| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| All right, so we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| I believe we also have Commissioner Anders who would like to weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Yeah, questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Why is a request for a study in an ordinance instead of a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5780)|
| 1:36:30| It's a planning commission study, I think, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Is Mr. Green present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| We can have him weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| All right, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| All right, Mr. Anders has got the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| but I am recognizing you to weigh in with an answer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Okay, Commissioner Anders, in response to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| what this ordinance amendment allows is for those instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| where a development may feel they do not need to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| the number of parking spaces required by the county's parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| they can do a quick study and present that to Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| And upon approval by Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| the number of parking spaces they provide can be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| And this makes it easier to provide reduced number of parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| better utilize tight spaces than going through a variance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| The ordinance was developed in coordination with Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| So this is going to eliminate the reduced square footage of parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| That process through Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Okay, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| And let's see, Commissioner Daley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Your hand's still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5869)|
| 1:37:49| That's, we have for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| BZA has had these appeals to lower parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| This is what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Commissioner Baylor can update you on what happened in Carter community if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| But this needs to be done, should have been done years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| for developers that we don't need 90 parking spaces for a $30 business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| This is what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| I'm going to ask Commissioner Baylor to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I think, isn't this the one I'm kind of calling the dollar general fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Yes, Mr. Chairman, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Yeah, this was a dollar general that had a contract to purchase some real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| from a family out in the 8th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| And the parking space requirement was just kind of unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| And it was putting the deal in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| And really, I mean, what happened was BZA is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| repeatedly making exceptions in situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| And so I believe the chairman of BZA wrote a letter to you, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| asking commission to put this in the form of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| rather than it constantly coming to BZA for exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| Yeah, and I think Taylor Forrester, Taylor's been helping with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| as well as the shots, I think, if I remember correctly on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| So, all right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| So I'll go back to the motion that is actually before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| was there a substitute motion from Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| to send this forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| for a proper reading at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| We will then, and Drusilla, if you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Drusilla will work with me over the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| or when we have to do the second reading, which will likely be in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| But if we have to move to June, then we'll schedule the public hearing in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| But I'd like to get this one done in May, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| But I'll work with Drusilla to schedule a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| It will likely be, I think, as we do a lot of these public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| immediately after a meeting or at seven o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| probably after a work session in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Drusilla, isn't that historically how we usually do these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| So we usually schedule for commissioners, you all may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| that we usually do them at like at seven o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| or immediately following the commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Well, we'll strive to schedule a public hearing at that time in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| unless we get some sort of direction that's not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| But that will be what we'll strive for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6017)|
| 1:40:17| So that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| Madam Clerk, if you could please lead a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6026)|

| 1:40:28| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6028)|

| 1:40:34| Commissioner Bealler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6036)|
| 1:40:36| Commissioner Bealler, that's aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6039)|
| 1:40:39| Commissioner Daly, that's aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Commissioner Jay, that's aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6043)|

| 1:46:35| to the Board of Commissioners of Knox Chapman Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Hopefully we need a vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| And I believe we've already deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| and when they set the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| we deferred the proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| We've already gotten the COVID update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| The discussion item is going to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| And the TDS item and Comcast in the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| I said I'd like, I was anticipating that we'd be about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| So we can have that discussion next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| at the Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Otherwise, I think we've gone through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| Commissioner Biggs, do we have a special guest here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| who'd like to make a public statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| Just a little bit of dad duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Say hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Yes, as we wrap up, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| so now we can have announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| So Commissioner Gill, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| Oh, Commissioner Gill, I'm sorry, your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| I'm not sure if we forgot to do this, but we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| April is National County Government Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| Well, it certainly has been a busy month for county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| I might look to Commissioner Schoonmaker and Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| and Bussler have been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| with the county association here for our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| if they'd like to, if y'all would all like to chime in on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| I know everybody right now has been sort of busy spinning plates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| but if Commissioner Schoonmaker would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| who's on the board for the Tennessee County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| our Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| might want to add anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| But Commissioner Gill, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| We've all been quite busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| So frankly, it's like missing a birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| It could have kind of slipped my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| since we've been so busy with the COVID challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| So, yes, we may want to defer this till Monday of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| So we can do a little more background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And there's a huge article that was in county, our NACO newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| So they've recognized the month and I mean, it just slipped by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| And I just wanted to make sure that we at least acknowledge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| and have some information sent out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Commissioner, would y'all like to maybe make that as part of a quick agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| that we can add at the meeting next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| Or excuse me, on Monday, we can add that next week, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| With the majority, I think two thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| we can change the agenda next week and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Drusilla and Jill, if you're listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| just let's add that for the meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| Not anything we need to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| It would just probably be a very brief discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| Anybody else have any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Yes, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Yes, I also wanted to just bring up that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| even though they postponed some of the activities and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| but it is National Crime Victims Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| And just wanted to bring that up to remember those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| who've lost loved ones and let them know they're in our prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6597)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6597)|

| 1:50:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Exciting thing that's going to be happening out in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| on what we call Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| We've got a group of people working right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| to get that highway on the National Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| for Scenic Highway because of its connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| with the Norris Dam Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| We will know, we've asked the mayor to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| And at the end of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| we'll be sending in a recommendation to National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| to get it put on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| So it's exciting for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| especially for District 7 out there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| So I just want to make that announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| I think, Commissioner Bussler, that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| My grandfather came to this town to be an accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| for when they were building the dams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| So I think that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| So that's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6647)|

| 1:54:12| or can I just close the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I don't think we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200420?start=6854)|
