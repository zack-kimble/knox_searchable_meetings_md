| 2:00:01| Let's go a minute and a half and try to be concise in your comments, and let's get this thing moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7201)|
| 2:00:09| A minute and a half per, and Mr. Mullins, you'll be given that additional time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7209)|
| 2:00:17| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| My name is Penny Wilkinson, and I live at 12109 Couch Mill Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| And I'm here today to talk about the property on Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| And as far as this case is concerned, in the Northwest County Sector Plan, this property is not located in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7229)|
| 2:00:35| I feel that it should stay at no more than one dwelling unit per acre until a new sector plan is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| Regardless of whether other properties in the Hardin Valley area have rezoning requests granted previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| there should not be a basis as to whether to make a decision about this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| We really should be asking if approving this rezoning request fits the overall goals of the sector plan, the mobility plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| and whether approving this zoning is a benefit to this community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| You can also easily look at what the community of Hardin Valley thinks about this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| Of course, there are always going to be folks who do not want any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| but you can clearly see by the number of signature additions started by HBPA this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| the public comments on the Knox County planning page, and the general dismay that you can find in a social media search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| that the people of Hardin Valley do not want to see this property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| This property is still under contract, and I feel if the buyers wanted to build a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| they should be able to do so with just the current zoning of one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Thank you. Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| Good afternoon. I just have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| Your name and address, please. Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| Norm Anderson, 12331 Daisywood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| I represent the Homeowner's Association of Forest Mills Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| We are west of the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| and what I will address later on in some statements regarding the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| of the traffic heading west on Couch Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| whereas the traffic impact assessment particularly focused on traffic heading east from the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| or the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| First off, my question is to why a Florida Department of Transportation plan was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| as compared to a Tennessee Department of Transportation for the traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| The traffic impact assessment made comment of improvements to the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7348)|
| 2:02:36| at the requested amount of three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| Would those improvements be provided if going with the staff's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| The topic of imminent domain regarding the right-of-way on Couch Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| and the intersection of Sam Lee has been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| The impact on Hardin Valley Road has not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| Mr. Commissioner Higgins, I believe it was, talked about in the other proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7383)|
| 2:03:12| how it wasn't fitting for the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| The congestion of this subdivision certainly does not fit the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| Your school calculation is inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| It already adds to the overcrowded schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| And one last thing I have to say is an environmental study regarding sinkholes and bat caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| I referenced the Glen on Hardin Valley subdivision, which was in lawsuit for sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| This is where I'm going to end my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Martha Arnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I'm not going to speak. I'll give my time to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7421)|
| 2:03:49| Karen Liu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| I'm Karen Liu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| I'm from 2819 Williams Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| Just recently, my fianc√© and I were newcomers to the Hardin Valley landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| We bought a house with one acre that was built in the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| We absolutely love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| We love the beautiful countryside and the small-town atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| We picked this area to live in because it's a community worth living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| So what makes it like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| It's one where we know our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| If someone moves here from another state, it should be because they've come to love Tennessee like we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| not just to take advantage of our low taxes and our low cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| We don't need to incentivize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| The community worth living in is where our neighbors can purchase their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| and therefore fulfilling the American dream instead of just renting or leasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| therefore building equity for some big city bigwig who might not even reside in-state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| or spends his money out-of-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Hardin Valley has had a beautiful country atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| but where would that country atmosphere be if every square inch of real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| is turned into manicured lawn and concrete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| I reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Mark Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7519)|
| 2:05:27| Good afternoon, and thank you very much for being able to come and talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| My name is Mark Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| I live at 12141 Couch Mill Road, and it's an area immediately north of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7532)|
| 2:05:40| What I'd like to address is something that one of the commission members mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| was the general policy plan in regards to Section 3.5 specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| If you're going to, when you're making these proposed changes in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| that you must have a traffic impact analysis demonstrating that the effect of the proposed similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| developments in traffic analysis zone will not unreasonably impair traffic flow along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| artillery roads through the adjacent planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| So the growth area in Hardin Valley is basically east of Steel Road and east of Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7575)|
| 2:06:26| The balance of Hardin Valley right now is not in the growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| and we've had a lot of discussion about that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| But my point to make here is that the intent of this, in the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| there's been about 10 subdivision approved sector plan amendments for similar or smaller developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7602)|
| 2:06:55| and the analysis is singular to those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| They don't look holistically at those developments within Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| and specifically in the traffic that flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| If you've been into Hardin Valley, there's a rush hour for Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| and part of that rush hour is traffic flowing out of this area that's not for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| into the development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| And there's been no analysis of that, really, that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| and there's not been any of these subdivisions in the last seven years that have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| So I think that the analysis here in this proposal is specific, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| to the main road intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| and the analysis needs to be expanded to include the impact on traffic within Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| specifically flowing back into the growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| and also in all of these other subdivisions that now have been approved for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7664)|
| 2:07:52| If you look at the summed estimated daily average trips, it's 25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| So that would be my recommendation, is that the traffic analysis, it needs to be more broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| It needs to support the desire that the traffic that this is going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| and similar developments are not impeding the traffic flowing back into the development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| If you don't believe me that that's a problem right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| please come down and drive towards Pellissippi, up Hardin Valley, starting at 4 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| It ain't going to get no better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Thank you, Mr. Regent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| Rodney Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Thank you. My name is Rodney Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| I live at 2520 Caspian Drive, which is the street immediately to the east of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| I unofficially represent my neighbors adjacent to the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| Our neighbor, our small street, contains houses built on an average of more than one acre per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7725)|
| 2:08:51| And so we come in opposition to the rezoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Within a 1.5 mile radius of my home, there are 13 developments under construction at this present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7734)|
| 2:09:04| Not new neighbors completed, but developments currently under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| And every one of them has something in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| They were given an amendment to the current zoning and allowed to make their way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| If we had been more aware of what we were doing the first time, the second time, the third time, the fourth time, the fifth time, the sixth time, the seventh time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7755)|
| 2:09:23| we wouldn't have so much opposition in Hardin Valley because if we approve this zoning, our community will be adversely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7763)|
| 2:09:35| I believe that's one of the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| We'll be adversely affected because our schools are beyond capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| Our street, Little Sam Lee Road there is 22 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| It will be beyond capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| Our bus transportation is beyond capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| We have no capacity for parks or greenways or any of that in Hardin Valley at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| So in the balance of my 11 seconds, I ask, please, do not pass this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| They're within their right to build as they wish within the zoning that they have as we all accepted when we bought our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| So let's not do this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| Put this off until capacity is not adversely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7816)|
| 2:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| The zoning that we're seeking is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| We all know that that means that whatever ultimate concept plan use on review that's going to move forward is going to come back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7835)|
| 2:10:44| Now, there's going to have to be a lot of engineering done to determine where can the property, where can the parcels be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7844)|
| 2:10:53| How can the layout be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| Are we going to have to avoid some of the hillside protection issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| Are we going to have to examine what kind of topography sinkholes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Of course we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| And all that has to happen once we know what kind of density we have and what can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| So those questions are going to be answered at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| Planned residential is the preferred zoning for both the developers and for the planners exactly for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| because we know we can then get another chance to look at this and dig into all those hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Today we're looking at the zoning and the density and whether or not that's consistent with the plans that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| And they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| They absolutely are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| They're consistent with the rural area, the rural residential sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| We're not asking for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| It's consistent with the growth policy plan under Section 3.5 with the traffic impact analysis that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| And we'll talk about that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Ms. Frazier mentioned a property that was denied about 1,500 feet away from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| And that was in 2018, I believe, off East Turpin Lane, which has pavement between 11 and 14 feet and 15 feet right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7910)|
| 2:12:00| They were asking for five units an acre and a sector plan amendment and wouldn't move off that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| And that's why that was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| It was a completely different circumstance than we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| Here we have Couch Mill Road, which is a major collector with an existing pavement of 18 feet and a right of way of 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7930)|
| 2:12:17| There's not going to be any condemnation needed to do the road improvements from this development to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| We'll need to bring the streets up to Knox County engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| We'll need to extend a sidewalk along the frontage or work with them on partnering with them to extend it to the intersection of Steel and Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| And you look at how you get to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| If you're coming off of Pellissippi, you're going to come down Hardin Valley Road through the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| You're going to make a right onto Steel Road in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| And you're going to go to the intersection of Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| And then you'll make a left onto Couch Mill from Steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| And that's where the road needs to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| That's about 1,600 feet from the property, about 1,700 feet from the proposed entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| Those things are going to need to be done, and that is going to help alleviate a lot of the traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| at least with regard to that traffic pattern through this area and the impact this development is going to cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7989)|
| 2:13:17| Hardin Valley is one of the fastest growing areas in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| We can't build homes fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| We can't build homes fast enough in Knox County to meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| And so we need to make sure we're doing it right, and this development meets the plans that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| Hardin Valley is a very expensive area to develop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| The property values are very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| And in order to be able to partner with the county and to help provide benefits to improve the infrastructure that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| that's where the additional density is needed so you have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| You can invest in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| Ms. Fraser talked about how expensive it is to widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| It is, and we're prepared to partner with that, with this development having the density that we're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| which is, again, consistent with the sector plan and growth policy plan that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| She mentioned the need for fire hydrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Those were fire hydrants that weren't previously installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| The sewers we're going to be able to run from Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| We're going to be able to run sewers to this area of Couch Mill, water to this area of Couch Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| to serve not only this development but to extend those services into areas that aren't otherwise available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| So there is a community benefit for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| It's just I don't think the community wants any more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| I understand that, but that's not the issues that we have here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| We have rules in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| We have plans in place, and we're asking to follow those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| Do plans need to be updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| I think we all look forward to some plans being revised and amended so we have more tools in our toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| and can bring something up to date that hasn't been revised in 20 years with a growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8093)|
| 2:15:03| School impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| I understand the schools out there are overcrowded right now, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| A couple of points I want to make on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Staff raised this in their report, and I think it needs to be emphasized here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8113)|
| 2:15:21| The estimated student yield presumes a full build-out of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| That is estimated to take about 2028, I think was the estimate now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| if we're able to move forward at a reasonable pace through our entitlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Build-out is subject to market forces, and timings vary widely from proposal to proposal, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| It also goes on to say that student yields from new development do not reflect a net addition to children in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| Additions occur incrementally over the build-out period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| New students may replace current population that ages through the system or moves from the attendance zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| So, I mean, it's not like as soon as we approve this, there's going to be another estimated 163 students in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8154)|
| 2:16:02| There is turnover that occurs, and there will be more growth that occurs while build-out is happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8162)|
| 2:16:10| So it's not an immediate deleterious impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| These things, we have time to adjust to it going through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| And there has been a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| I believe it's already been filed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| Now, that's not been reviewed yet, and it's subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| One of the things in that use on review for this development that the developer is proposing is 113 townhomes as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8190)|
| 2:16:37| Now, that's important because if you're looking at three units an acre, about one-third, more than one-third, is going to be a townhome type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8197)|
| 2:16:46| At least that's their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Those types of housing, it fulfills a couple of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| One, it fills that missing middle that we talk about and we don't often see coming before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| It also, those types of housing have more of a market towards empty nesters and individuals that won't necessarily have an impact to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8217)|
| 2:17:06| So that brings it back to that point right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| What ‚Äì and I do appreciate Ms. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| We reached out to her early on in the process, met with her, with Mr. Murphy, with Commissioner Hill and her district there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| And I did offer if we want to have a larger meeting with more people, I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| But in that conversation, you know, it was really clear that, you know, they really want a moratorium on development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8248)|
| 2:17:36| That's basically what Mr. Murphy said earlier today, and that's what I heard a lot of the people here say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| It's like, well, we wanted to stay agricultural and not allow any rezoning, but that's not what the sector plan allows for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| and that's not what the growth policy plan allows for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| So ‚Äì and if you stay static like that until the plans change, you lose opportunities for a developer like this that is willing to partner with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8271)|
| 2:18:01| to help improve the roads, to help improve the sewers, to help improve the water access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| So we do think there is a community benefit that extends beyond meeting the great housing need that we all know there is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8286)|
| 2:18:16| So I think I've said everything that I need to say, but I'm here for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| So please, if there's anything, I've got four more minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| I'd love to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| I really don't have any question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| I just want to thank the speakers that all came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| Y'all can come back next month, and I don't have to give my annual ‚Äì my monthly talk about the need for the growth plan to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8319)|
| 2:18:47| But I do want to say this because I think it's important, especially for you all to take back home to your friends and those that are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| Now is the time for everybody to contact your city council, your county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| Start getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| Knox County is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| It is growing exceptionally fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| If you wait for the sign to go up for a rezoning, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| So everybody across all sectors ‚Äì I mean, if you look from West Knoxville to east, north, and south, it's growing everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| So we just need the citizens of Knox County, the 400-and-some-odd-thousand people that live in this county to get involved in deciding what we want to be for the next 10, 20, 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8356)|
| 2:19:27| because that's really what's going to drive a lot of the decisions that this body has to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| So I just want to say now is the time to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| Don't wait until you see that rezoning sign go up in a property and get involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| It's really too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| You need to get involved now as we look at really the next 30 years for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| Commissioners, you've heard comments from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| You've heard Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| Your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Yeah, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| Staff recommendation is for two units an acre, and you're asking for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| Where are you on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| Are you standing on three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| Is that where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Yes, we're standing on three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| That's why we spoke about the 3.5 growth policy plan and the justification for being able to go up to three units an acre in the current sector plan and in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8414)|
| 2:20:25| It's consistent with those two documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Ra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| I'm appreciative, again, of community input on these cases, and I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8437)|
| 2:20:45| I actually live out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I live in Carnes and travel that area quite a bit, and it is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| We're growing by leaps and bounds in the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| And we have to make, you know, earlier I heard a comment that it's up to our commission and our staff to ensure proper development and responsible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8457)|
| 2:21:10| and I'm going to tell you the staff does a great job, I think, in my opinion, of doing just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8470)|
| 2:21:18| We can't put a fence around Hardin Valley and keep people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| You just can't do it, and that's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| So we have to maintain some semblance moving forward of responsible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| and I think this is a responsible development based on the needs in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| And I'd like to make a motion we approve planned residential zoning per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| We have a motion by Commissioner Ra, seconded by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| to approve PR planned residential up to two dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| All in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| I was just going to say that, you know, half a unit an acre, one unit an acre, we create sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8525)|
| 2:22:15| We end up taking up twice, three times the number of farms to accommodate the same number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| I know this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| I've been all over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| It's got some environmental challenges to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| I think, Kim, when you ask how does it add value, I think you're going to see a really neat development on this track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8546)|
| 2:22:35| because they can utilize the areas that aren't suitable for development for a park or walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| And I know the property well, and I know the developer well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| and I think you can have an extremely good result with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| I would have supported more density, but the motion was already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8573)|
| 2:22:59| And I know also that it feels like when you live somewhere that you're the only place in town with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8579)|
| 2:23:06| But I can promise you I live in Rocky Hill, and I would trade your traffic for mine any day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| And my son attended Rocky Hill Elementary three years in a row in a cubicle classroom out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8592)|
| 2:23:20| It's just it's not just you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| It's, you know, not just the way things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Hold your comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| Could I address his comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| Commissioner, right now we're kind of in a motion, but I just wanted to make those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| Ms. Frazier, right now we're in deliberations with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| Yes, I know. If you ask a question, though, I can't respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| Did he ask a question or make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| He's in the point of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| We have a motion and a second to approve PR plan residential zoning up to two dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8633)|
| 2:24:01| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8650)|
| 2:24:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| We're going to take a five minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| We'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| If you would return to your seats and we'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8674)|
| 2:25:02| Next is a sector plan and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| This is item number 18, file 12K21RZ and 12B21SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| Applicant is Ball Homes, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| Location, north side of Hickory Creek Road, west side of West Gallaher Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| Tract is 23.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| Present plan designation zoning is agricultural, HP hillside protection and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| Post plan designation zoning and rural residential, hillside protection and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8732)|
| 2:25:39| Density proposed up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| Staff recommendation, approve the northwest county sector plan amendment to rural residential and HP hillside protection because it is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8744)|
| 2:25:57| Also to approve PR plan residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8757)|
| 2:26:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| You don't look like Mr. Hickey, but I'll take it for your word you're representing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| Mr. Hickey is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| I can see Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| My name is John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| I represent Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| My portion of this is going to be somewhat brief and then I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| We asked for four units per acre and there is some logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8790)|
| 2:26:38| One is if you look at the tract and the topography of the tract, 68.4% of this tract is non-hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8798)|
| 2:26:48| If you take the part that's less than 15%, has less than a 15% slope, 95.2% of this property has less than a 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8808)|
| 2:27:03| One of the reasons we need more density is, and I think Mr. Snowden from the engineering department can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8823)|
| 2:27:17| there's a problem with Galahar Ferry Road and there's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| What Ball Homes is going to do is, if we can get the extra density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| they're going to work with the county engineering and make some improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| give up land to make some improvements on Galahar Ferry to make it a safer place for people to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8856)|
| 2:27:47| I know that folks talk about the infrastructure and improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| but as we all know, infrastructure improvements follow development and not preceded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| If you don't have the people, there's not going to be any need for the improved roads, schools, sewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| and I represent two utilities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| I know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| So I think that this development in the way Ball Homes, and everybody here knows Ball Homes and what a good job they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| They do what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| They're members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| They help the community, and they try to do the right thing in every project that they participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8900)|
| 2:28:29| And Mr. Hickey is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| He would be happy to answer any questions that any of you have about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| Mr. Hickey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| Name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8920)|

| 2:28:48| I'd just like to point out that if you look up and down Horn Valley and Hickory Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| this is probably one of the flattest pieces of property in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8933)|
| 2:29:00| It would probably be one of the flattest pieces of property that I've developed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| In addition, there has been several utility upgrades in the area to accommodate the growth that's going on in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8945)|
| 2:29:14| There's a new northwest elementary school being built currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| and to the east of this we're currently in participation with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8958)|
| 2:29:27| to improve and build a roundabout at the Hickory Creek and Horn Valley intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8967)|
| 2:29:34| and we are in preliminary discussions on this one to make improvements to this interchange at East Gowher and Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8974)|
| 2:29:44| West Gowher and Hickory Creek, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| So if anyone has any questions for me, just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| Ms. Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8994)|

| 2:29:59| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| Thanks to Ryan Hickey and also to Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| I'm always curious to hear his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| I always look forward to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| I'm not going to go into a lot of detail because I've already provided you with the community's position on additional rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| sector plan amendments, and concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| I do want to clarify that we are not asking for a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| That is not at all what this community is asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| We are asking you to do what is already expected of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| and that is to uphold land use classifications and zonings in the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9026)|
| 2:30:33| I'm just going to give you an update on all the current ball developments in the Horn Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| and how our community is responding to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Ball Homes currently has many projects underway or planned for the Horn Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| and several connections to other cases heard before this body in the northwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| Laurel Ridge phases 1, 2, 3, 242 total lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| which has already required Knox County Schools to add a bus to accommodate the student yield of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9053)|
| 2:31:00| The Brook at Hardin Valley, 42 lots, which this body approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9060)|

| 2:32:20| Like I said, we understand that the plan is for townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9140)|

| 2:32:46| So the applicant here, those are all the things that are going on in Hardin Valley with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| Those are the number of lots and the homes that we have coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| The applicant has requested 4 dwellings per acre for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9175)|
| 2:33:00| Staff has recommended 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9180)|

| 2:33:21| and we do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| We always appreciate and encourage every developer to work with our county to work on our infrastructure needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| There's no preliminary soft or concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| so the number of lots is yet to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| and feasibility of amenities, housing options, and recreational offerings cannot be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9215)|

| 2:33:53| County leaders have encouraged us, the citizens, to ask more from your development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9233)|
| 2:34:00| to offset our community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| So I've tirelessly been doing that for years, and I continue to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9243)|
| 2:34:09| and I ask you today to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| Schools are overcrowded. There's a shortage of buses and bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| Class sizes are maxed out at the state level of 35 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| We can't get sidewalks in PRZ zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| We have a history making grade level sizes in our 4th and 5th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9263)|

| 2:34:39| Again, I remind you, we've had 4014 suicide assessments this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| and if you don't think that the decisions of this body have any correlation to those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| you're mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| In closing, a quick reminder that the Hardin Valley Community Center on Hickory Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| was condemned and demolished, stopping community access to athletic practice fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| We respectfully ask that you uphold the current zoning of ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| and the sector plan use of rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| Thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| I think I'd like to have Mr. Snowden address some of the traffic issues that we're going to help resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| and secondly, in response to Ms. Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| the houses out there that come on a line to be sold are usually sold either before they're built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9319)|
| 2:35:27| or right when they're built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| There's an extraordinary demand for housing everywhere in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| and in particular in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| Jim Snowden, Knox County Engineering 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| We have met with Ball Homes and had some conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| As you can see on the map there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| their property doesn't have a tremendous amount of frontage on Hickory Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| so it would require a variance to the intersection offset, which we talked to them about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| We've got an intersection there that, as you can see, kind of comes in at a skew, which is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| What you can't see there is it actually kind of comes up great a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| so it has a horizontal and vertical component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| What we would like to do is kind of create more of a 90-degree intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| and then kind of introduce a gradual curve and tie back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| and kind of fix both the horizontal and the vertical with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| but that eats into a developable area for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| But they've been receptive to that, and we would like to fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| because that intersection is a little problematic for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| and it would be a good opportunity for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| I did want to mention Kim talks about the brook at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| They did build a section of sidewalk along the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| We are having a capital project to tie that in along the frontage of Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| and hopefully retain funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| So that's a good indication of where our most recent sidewalk ordinance developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| are building certain sections, and we're filling in those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| So that's a good instance where those partnerships hopefully work out to benefit the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| So anyway, if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9427)|

| 2:39:46| I don't want you all to know my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9586)|
| 2:39:49| Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| Again, this is off of Buttermilk, 53 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| We've been advised that discussion pertains to specific requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| and considerations should happen at the concept plan phase of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| Furthermore, applicants and sometimes their counsel tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| that our concerns will be addressed during their creation of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| and shared with community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Or we discover that certain conditions during the zoning or sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| amendment process have not been included in the concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| That is why I'm asking for discussion and considerations of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| to ensure that those points have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| Community members would simply like to see a variety of housing design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| and subdivision options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| We feel that proposed development lacks creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| and does not include enough recreational offerings to our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| Citizens also should not be deprived of these options and offerings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| because of a problematic topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| Not feasible to include options or offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| is not the responsibility of the citizen nor the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9645)|
| 2:40:49| We are asking for developments that add value to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| and future residents beyond housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| We ask that the applicant include plans for a small playground area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| Thank you, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Mr. Sharpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| I haven't discussed specifically what types of amenities they intend on providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| but we are leaving, I think, 45% of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| is going to remain in open space or common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| so there will be opportunities for people to get outside and enjoy the outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9677)|
| 2:41:26| Do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Isn't this the time when we would be told what amenities there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| There's not some other time where we would be told that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| This is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| So there's just nothing planned except there's the open space and that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| Not at this point, no, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| And we understand that if they do wish to offer amenities in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| we'll have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| I'm not understanding because Commissioner Phillips just said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| this is the time we would learn about benefits and amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| and you've said there are none except the open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| but then you just said you would be coming back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| If they do plan on doing some or decide to do some in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| we acknowledge that we would have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| But there's not an obligation at this time to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| For the record, I think open space is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| As long as it's truly open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| it's not like a retention pond or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| But is this a time when I can ask about would you be willing to put in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| playground since there's a specific request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| some kind of benefit of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| I don't want to commit my client to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9766)|
| 2:42:56| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9780)|
| 2:43:01| I guess I am in agreement with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| It sounds like, it looks like this is a pretty steep piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| What, I guess, can you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| would you be willing to dedicate a piece of the end of these cul-de-sacs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| or some bit of property for a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| Actually, one of the comments at the end of, I think it was Road B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9801)|
| 2:43:27| and it doesn't show up on this drawing, but we're being, to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| we're being required to stub out for a future right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9812)|
| 2:43:40| I mean, again, you know, 45% of the property is going to be common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| so if they want to do a playground or something outdoor, there's plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| Well, you'll need probably a flat area, though, for a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| It looks like a lot of it's steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| Is there any other place that you could propose something other than in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| I'll have to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| I can't say with certainty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| Director Brooks, what is our, I mean, can we put a stipulation in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| a condition of development that we request a playground or some flat area for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9847)|
| 2:44:13| Yes, that can be part of your discussion today, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9853)|
| 2:44:19| If I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| I mean, I could commit to leaving a flat area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| but I don't know if they want a playground with equipment per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| I think they want playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Can we commit to playground equipment on a flat piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| No, ma'am, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| And the reason I say is I've heard mixed stories about providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| playgrounds as it relates to liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9884)|
| 2:44:50| I've heard some people love them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| and some people won't build them because of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| That's kind of what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| Commissioner, what you can do, I mean, you can improve with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9899)|
| 2:45:05| You can deny it or you can postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| You do have some options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Now, you know, the regulations are not specific on how we address community amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9911)|
| 2:45:19| and that's a problem that we've had for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| Whether it's permitted or it's required is very subjective at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9925)|
| 2:45:32| His comment about liability on a playground is that how do most developments handle this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| Once they step away and they leave that for the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| Most of them are put in with a POA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| They become the POA responsibility for maintenance and upkeep and liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9945)|
| 2:45:52| And that's pretty common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| That's pretty common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Relatively common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| Commissioner Smith probably has done some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| Yeah, we do pools sometimes, and I don't like pools anymore because they're so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9961)|
| 2:46:08| I think playgrounds are a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| I wish more people would do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| I was just going to ask the applicant, are you representing a developer that wants to sell lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| or is it a builder that will be building the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| The developer has a dedicated builder for his properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| So that's why you can't really make that commitment without talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| Yes, sir. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| I mean, if a playground is something that we feel strongly about in this and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9990)|
| 2:46:36| I mean, maybe we ask if we could give them 30 days and see if there's a way you could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=9996)|
| 2:46:41| and it may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| I honestly like that idea because what is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| and I'm saying this from Commissioner Midas's perspective because I've now sat through several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10007)|
| 2:46:52| where there's a question mark about what is the benefit, and we're unsure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| and we're unsure how to qualify what a benefit or amenity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| In this case, we have a very specific request, which is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10022)|
| 2:47:07| Like, this is what the community would like to have in that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| So I feel more comfortable saying there's open space, it's been dedicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| so it's not an impossibility, but to have a 30-day postponement to have them come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| here's the playground, or no, we're not doing a playground, would answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| I guess my concern is can we give that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| I mean, if that's the direction the commission wants to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| I think you need to give them some direction of what you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| I mean, they may come back with a teeter-totter and say, that's our playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10055)|
| 2:47:40| and, you know, you weren't more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| So, you know, maybe size, maybe amenities you would like to see included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10063)|
| 2:47:48| and that might give Mr. Sharp and his client a little more understanding of what's expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| Something else, Pat, is that is this playground that the community wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| in or in this neighborhood, is it going to be for the public outside of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10080)|
| 2:48:05| or is it just for the people in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| And so if you're a resident who lives in there, do you want this open where people drive in and park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10088)|
| 2:48:14| and everybody from all over comes and hangs out at your little park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| or do you want to make it exclusive for just the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| And so the request is from the outside community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10101)|
| 2:48:26| but it's really going to be more about the people that live in there, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10106)|
| 2:48:33| Well, we have a neighborhood park in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| and I'll say that it's pretty much used as a city park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| but it's pretty much used exclusively by the residents of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10121)|
| 2:48:45| And I've got one in my neighborhood similar to Amy's, but it's public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10125)|
| 2:48:50| And it's maintained by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| In this particular case, if it's built, it's probably going to be maintained by the Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| and they probably will not, because it's wear and tear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| They probably don't want residents from outside the area coming in, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| We've got a lot of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| I'm sure you recognize this Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| My question is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| We have a group, a committee, I think, looking into the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10158)|
| 2:49:27| because this comes up repeatedly, that what is required in a PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10167)|
| 2:49:36| if you read what's required in a PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| it is nothing like what we approve in a PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| or what we ask for, and I'm not really in favor of trying to revise a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10185)|
| 2:49:52| It usually doesn't work out very well when we as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10192)|
| 2:49:58| we all have a different idea of what it should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| Like you say, they might have one teeter-totter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| or they might put a swimming pool in, which nobody wants anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| I just think that my question of staff is, where is that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10210)|
| 2:50:21| What are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| It's been over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| That's correct, Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| It's something that we need to pick back up and move those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| I think we had set it aside because we knew that a comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| and transportation plan was coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| but obviously it's something that we can at least make some initial modifications to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| and bring it before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| We really don't have any guidance on PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| other than how many units we're going to approve to a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10250)|
| 2:50:55| Other than that, we don't ask anything, and we get very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10255)|
| 2:51:02| I'll leave it at that, but that's what needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| not us trying to design his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10265)|
| 2:51:11| That chair recognizes Commissioner Selzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10271)|
| 2:51:17| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| I'm just going to echo what Dick just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| My concern is, if this is going to be a community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| we need to go to county commission because the county needs to carry the liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| and there needs to be adequate parking for people to get there in and out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10293)|
| 2:51:37| But we shouldn't put that burden on the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10297)|
| 2:51:40| If this is just going to be that one specific neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10300)|
| 2:51:43| I think they can decide what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| The neighborhood I live in, we have a park that the HOA takes care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| but we have parking, and it's part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| So I think we've got to be careful that we're not just going and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| we're going to plop a community park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| I love the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| I just don't know if that's the right ‚Äì we need to go to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| and they need to request that of county commission to put something out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| so that the county is carrying the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| and not putting that on just one HOA for the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| So with that, I'm ‚Äì well, I see other lights just popped on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| so I'll just wait to make my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| Commissioner Matus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| I guess I was assuming that this was going to be a neighborhood park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| and not a community park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| That is what we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| If that's a question and I can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| And I do think that ‚Äì just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| I do think that because the topography of this development is somewhat limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10356)|
| 2:52:41| with all of the hills and the ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| that it would be nice to have a flat area for the kids in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| I'm requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| And I would say if there was already houses being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10369)|
| 2:52:55| and the people who were having those houses being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| were requesting the park, I would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| But the request isn't coming from anyone who owns or is building right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| It's coming from the community around that for a park in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| That's where my ‚Äì| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| But does that happen at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| So it doesn't get built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| I think it becomes part of what the community ‚Äì| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| what that development is looking for for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| That's where it goes back to the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| They've made a decision of what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| I don't know if that park fits in with what they're developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| That's just where my point comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| The request is coming from the community for a park in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| It's not coming from the people who are actually going to be living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| I think we need to differentiate between a public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| and just call it either a public park or a private park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| A private park is going to be run by the HOA, be built by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| The community area wants an amenity like this because they haven't been getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| So if we start mandating them in these kind of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| that's what the community wants, where they live, to have a private park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10433)|
| 2:53:57| I mean, there's no sidewalks to walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| They're the only people going to be able to get to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| So I think we should require a private park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10442)|
| 2:54:07| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| I thought that it was for the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| That's what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10452)|
| 2:54:13| is this plan for this particular development, not for a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10453)|
| 2:54:18| but this specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| So I echo what Commissioner Schelso said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| I believe that we should require this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| It can be a flat space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| but there's some area that's dedicated for that so that something can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| programmed there for children and those community members to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| It's a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| The chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| and I'll make a comment or two afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| I think these are all good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| The problem is this applicant is spending a lot of money generating a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| plan that was probably turned in a month and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| and he gets to the meeting, and now he says we have to have a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| Nobody probably suggested to him that there should be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| Have we asked a park in any other concept plan that we've looked at today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| Is that something we're going to start doing for everyone or just this guy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| And so maybe what we ought to do is consider either approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10513)|
| 2:55:20| and moving forward with instruction to staff that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| we think we want to start putting more weight on an amenity or postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10524)|
| 2:55:32| And from this point, if that's what we really want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| then we need to be consistent in how we apply it because I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| applicant probably didn't expect that we were going to come in here and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| about putting a park on the plan that he did a month and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| Well, actually, this was approved at 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| We just added a couple lots, so no park was mentioned in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| And, again, I found out about this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| Yeah, that's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| Commissioner Matus, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| Can I talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| No, I mean, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| Do you have anything else you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| I don't know what I'm going to do actually right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| Well, I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| So, you know, I got a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10582)|
| 2:56:27| You know, could staff provide commission with some guidance in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10587)|
| 2:56:36| that will have to go through the process of everything approved by county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| commission, by the planning commission, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| Could we interpret the subdivision regulations to provide that we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10602)|
| 2:56:50| authority over putting in amenities in these neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| Could we have some guidelines that would be, I guess, legal and not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| subject to question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10621)|
| 2:57:06| Do you understand my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| I believe so, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| I think it goes back to the need to take a look at the plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| zone is what I'm hearing, is that you want some very more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| And this is something that we discussed as a committee is how we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| outline those types of requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| But I think also I appreciate Commissioner Scott Smith's statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| about providing direction to staff and saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| these are things that we would like for you all to start looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| and start advising applicants of going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| I think that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| Can I have a moment to respond since the applicant was able to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| to those comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| Ms. Frazier, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| Try to do it quickly, please, because we've got another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| I will make it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| I just wanted to address why we're bringing this to your attention now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| It's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| We've been bringing this to your attention and this body's attention for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| And we've requested that amenities be discussed at this phase of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| process and during the whole concept use on review design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| This isn't a new ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| We've been asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| It may feel like it, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| We ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| We have been advised to ask our development community to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10707)|
| 2:58:33| because our county can't meet the needs of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| And so that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| It may not be on your time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| I apologize, but I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| So whatever you have to do so that you're not doing this every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| it's this person or that body or those staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| do whatever you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| But we cannot wait any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| So, yes, put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| I am requesting formally that this body and the staff look at every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10747)|
| 2:59:11| concept plan and see if there is a usable recreational space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| not a dog park, not open space, because I know and you know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| always just unusable land that you can't build a house on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10760)|
| 2:59:27| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| And I'm tired of it, and I've been kind, and I've been gracious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10769)|
| 2:59:33| and I've been respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| But I am over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| And it starts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| You have the opportunity to reshape the way that we approach land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| and concept plans and designs and better communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| instead of putting it all on these fine people, the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| our county departments, and just telling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| you fix it, you deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| Come to citizens and tell us, you ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| So I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10811)|
| 3:00:12| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10815)|
| 3:00:16| Nobody's putting it on anybody else, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| We're just having a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10826)|
| 3:00:31| I agree with Amy that this PR zone needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10831)|
| 3:00:37| I agree that we probably need to come up with some guidance to amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10837)|
| 3:00:42| At this point, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| And I've said this before when we're talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10845)|
| 3:00:48| forcing this development to do this because we think it's a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| and the development before didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| When they come to us with a plan that matches the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| and matches what we've instructed them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| for us to come up here and sit and say we're going to make up things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| and we're going to be arbitrary about each development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| and require different things is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| If we're going to require a park and a subdivision in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| then the PR zone should say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| and they should know that is going to happen when they propose a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| And I think it's wrong to come up here and stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| and hold people responsible for things that are not in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| when they meet the requirements of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10890)|
| 3:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| When you look at this specific concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| there's not even really open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| I mean, there's drainage areas, there's sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| An amenity such as open space and other concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| can at least maybe be turned into a potential park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| by the HOA of that subdivision in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| So I think we need to, I might need help figuring out the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| for a certain number of square feet of a minimally sloped area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| to be set aside as another condition of just open space at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10932)|
| 3:02:20| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| I want to respond to what Commissioner Ross said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10944)|
| 3:02:29| Because we do have the responsibility to review the plan that's presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10949)|
| 3:02:40| And we have for over a year now struggled with this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| because the guidelines say it should have amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| If you're in the PR, you're going to have amenities that are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| and make this a much more exciting place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| My word, not the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10980)|
| 3:03:04| But this is the first time that I remember a specific ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10984)|
| 3:03:12| In previous times, we've struggled with it because we've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10992)|
| 3:03:16| well, I don't think that's an amenity or I think that is an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=10996)|
| 3:03:20| And in this case, we actually have someone here making a specific request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11000)|
| 3:03:26| of what that amenity should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| I just don't recall that having happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| And so I am trying to respond to that and meet the responsibility of a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| to say, does this plan provide for that one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11019)|
| 3:03:45| This plan doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| This is our chance to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| While it may seem capricious or arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| the difference is that this is the time someone is actually asking for something specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| and it doesn't seem to be a real, comparatively, a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11039)|
| 3:04:08| It's not a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| It's not a giant guest house or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| It's a playground or a small flat space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| I am not an expert on playgrounds or flat spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| but I think that this is a time and an opportunity for our body to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11060)|
| 3:04:27| how we would like to deal with this differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11067)|
| 3:04:30| Again, it's not capricious or arbitrary because something has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11070)|
| 3:04:34| We have a different request in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| and that's why our response to that can be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11076)|
| 3:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| Mr. Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| I have a question for Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| What you just said, Ms. Brooks, is let's look at a timeline, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11091)|
| 3:04:59| so that we can start looking at the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| Can we request of you and the staff that in January, tell me if it's too soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11102)|
| 3:05:10| so just in the next 30 days that you all would come up with a timeline of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| when all of these discussions will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| when we hope to have a final recommendation for updating the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| so that every developer from that point forward knows what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| It's updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| Basically, I agree with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| I don't like here's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| You come in here, and we're going to change the rules on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| So let's go through the process of setting out a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| Here's when we're going to get it updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| Here's the new rules of what we're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| Now everyone is following it because we have had a specific request for an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11144)|
| 3:05:49| I think that needs to be built into the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| not necessarily just dumped in at the last second after someone has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| years of putting all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| So that's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Is 30 days enough time for you all to think about with the holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| and everything that you could possibly come back in January with a rough timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| of when we think we could have everything updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| That's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11171)|
| 3:06:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11173)|
| 3:06:14| Then with that, I'm going to make a motion that we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| subject to the nine conditions per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11181)|

| 3:06:26| second by Commissioner Graf to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11192)|

| 3:06:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| for up to 61 detached dwelling units on individual lots subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11209)|
| 3:06:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11210)|

| 3:07:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| Next is item 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| This is another one I hope we've removed off of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11236)|
| 3:07:28| Yeah, 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11249)|
| 3:07:30| Agenda item number 23, file 12SD21C and 12G21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11250)|
| 3:07:37| Briggs Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| The applicant is Robin Askew, trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| Location, southeast side of Marietta Church Road, south of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11262)|
| 3:07:48| Approximate acreage, 94.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| Zoning is PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| Opposed, use detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| Number of lots, 188.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| There are several, six design standards requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11281)|
| 3:08:12| The staff recommendation, approve alternative design standards one through six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| on the recommendation of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11298)|
| 3:08:23| and because site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| it will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| Second recommendation, approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11311)|
| 3:08:37| Third recommendation, approve the development plan up to 188 detached dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11317)|
| 3:08:43| on individual lots subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| Yes, Jared Garceau on behalf of the applicant, 620 Market Street, suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11329)|
| 3:08:55| If there's opposition, I'll reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| Would the opposition like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11342)|
| 3:09:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| I'll speak if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| On this one, I think the issue that we're wondering is that this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11357)|
| 3:09:21| there's two concept plans that are adjacent to each other today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11361)|
| 3:09:24| There's Briggs Station and I think number 22, which is an extension for Binding Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11364)|
| 3:09:29| And the question really put a comment in on the public record is really about connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11369)|
| 3:09:35| and is it possible to create connections between these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| There is something when you're looking at the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11378)|
| 3:09:40| concept plans are related to subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| There's statements in the subdivision regulations that are really encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| street connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| Kind of a little strange when you've got two lots that are being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| you know, right at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| If you read it, the intent is kind of like, well, if it's undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| then you should stub out a connection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| And if it is already developed, then you should be connecting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| But in this case, yeah, so the real question is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| is there any possibility of connecting those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11408)|
| 3:10:09| So that really relates to is this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| doing what it needs to do to meet the standards and subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11415)|
| 3:10:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| I'm filling in for my law partner, Robin, to ask you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| I'm going to keep my comments brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| The staff has recommended approval with certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| We have no objection to the conditions and plan to implement them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11433)|
| 3:10:40| It's my understanding that the staff looked at the issue of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| That's not a requirement of any applicable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11444)|
| 3:10:48| but I understand that it's encouraged if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| It's not feasible in this case, as I understand from the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11451)|
| 3:10:56| And because this proposed use complies or this concept plan complies with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11456)|
| 3:11:03| all applicable plans as determined by the staff, we request approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| Can staff explain again, if you have already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| why the connectivity isn't possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11481)|
| 3:11:22| I'll be happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| Is this microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| It doesn't seem to be working very well, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| That's the bad one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| I need to mark this one with a little flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| On the plan sheet, you see the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| The most logical exterior connection that would be possible here is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11500)|
| 3:11:45| cul-de-sac on the north side of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| If you can scroll that down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11508)|
| 3:11:56| The neighborhood just to the northeast is the Binding Mill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| That was on our agenda, and it was approved on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| They were making a minor modification to that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| That subdivision has a cul-de-sac that's not too far distant away from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11527)|
| 3:12:13| cul-de-sac, but they were not modifying that portion of their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| and there's a lot at the end of their cul-de-sac that would essentially block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| or make a road connection between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11543)|
| 3:12:27| But there's also a lot of topography change between the two cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| estimated at about a 60-foot drop between the two, or about 600 feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11552)|
| 3:12:37| So it's just a challenging connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| Usually we look for connections that are a little bit more feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11561)|
| 3:12:44| closer to a grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11564)|
| 3:12:47| If you go different directions around the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| either you're going up over a ridge or smaller parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| they most likely will not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11574)|
| 3:12:58| So there's really no need to stub out in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| So that's the main reason why we didn't really feel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| It would have been a lot of work to make a connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| It just did not seem like a typical ask from us to make that kind of connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11590)|
| 3:13:16| especially since that development has already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| and they weren't modifying that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| So it really wasn't two brand-new subdivisions coming at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| where we could work together while they're still modifying the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| The Monte Mill one was already approved at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| and there was no road stub out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| Yeah, this is a good example of why on our last plan that had 36 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11622)|
| 3:13:52| and we're sitting here debating what amenities should go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| This one has 188, and we're not saying anything about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11637)|
| 3:14:04| or giving them any ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11644)|
| 3:14:08| We haven't demanded, we haven't, I take that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| we haven't even requested anything prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11652)|
| 3:14:18| We've been through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| We've asked the staff to give us some guidance on it, which we haven't gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| But we can't sit here, or we shouldn't sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| and try and revise the plan that they send in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| They should send it in and work with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| and get something that's compatible with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| I think we just, we're trying to do, we shouldn't be designing their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11685)|
| 3:14:53| We don't have any right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| So just to reference back where we were just one plan ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11696)|
| 3:15:03| we were trying to tell them what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| and yet we get something four or five times as large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11706)|
| 3:15:09| and we're just going to pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11712)|
| 3:15:13| I agree with you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11713)|
| 3:15:17| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11717)|
| 3:15:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| It's not our staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| On the alternative design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| Sorry, the website's emptying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| Nothing going below right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| Okay, so your motion is to approve the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| one through six per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| Second by Commissioner Minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11740)|

| 3:15:46| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11752)|

| 3:15:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11754)|
| 3:15:55| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11755)|

| 3:16:09| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the development plan for up to 188 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11769)|
| 3:16:15| on individual lots subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| Motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| seconded by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11782)|
| 3:16:24| to approve the development plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11786)|

| 3:16:30| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| Next is agenda item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| It was also removed, I think, off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| This is a subdivision report and concept file 12SE21C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11799)|
| 3:16:44| The subdivision is Prosperity Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| Applicant developer is Steve Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| Location, west side of Everett Road, north side of El Camino Lane, south side of Buttermilk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11809)|
| 3:16:56| Acreage is 166 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| Zoning is CB Business and Manufacturing and RB General Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11819)|
| 3:17:05| Proposed use, commercial, undefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| Number of lots, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| Subdivision variances, we do have four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| Staff recommendation, approve variances one, two, and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11837)|
| 3:17:20| on the recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| Because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| it will not create a traffic hazard denying variance number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11850)|
| 3:17:36| Also recommendation, approve the concept plan for the construction and planning of the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| only subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| The applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11866)|
| 3:17:47| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| No, I pulled it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11872)|
| 3:17:56| You may proceed, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| We're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11878)|
| 3:17:59| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11881)|
| 3:18:02| Okay, I pulled it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11882)|
| 3:18:04| This won't take long, but I just wanted to address the commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| I had trouble approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11888)|
| 3:18:13| I guess it's funny because we were talking about Thunder Mountain earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| and I think if you look at this piece of property, it's zoned CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| which does not allow hillside and ridgetop protection plan on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11902)|
| 3:18:29| The applicant is proposing, I believe Mike, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11909)|
| 3:18:33| we decided 97 feet of the hillside of the ridgetop to be removed in order for this road to be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11913)|
| 3:18:42| Is there any way, I know the Internet's kind of crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| but can we pull up a pictometry view of that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11925)|
| 3:18:50| And if anything, it's kind of a good educational standpoint from us as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| just to see kind of what can happen in the CB zone if there's not hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11934)|
| 3:19:03| You know, this piece of property is right on the Knox County line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| and so when you're coming from either Chattanooga or Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| and you enter just past the merger of I-40, this is the piece of property you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11950)|
| 3:19:17| As a conservationist, it upsets me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11957)|
| 3:19:20| I'm sorry. It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11960)|
| 3:19:21| To see how much grading and tree removal has been done on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| and the thought of taking another 100 feet off of the top of that ridge, I just can't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11966)|
| 3:19:36| Apparently, I guess in 2019, the backside, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11976)|
| 3:19:41| the backside of this piece of property was planned, it was up for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11981)|
| 3:19:47| I think staff recommended planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| And now because it is all CB, that is technically going to be allowed on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11991)|
| 3:19:57| to be able to remove that top part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| There's not a street view that you can show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12000)|
| 3:20:08| Has anyone gone by to look at it? I know it's out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12008)|
| 3:20:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12039)|
| 3:20:42| So I'm assuming the applicant has worked on grading this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12042)|
| 3:20:47| and removing the forestation of this piece of property over the past however many years it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12047)|
| 3:20:53| based on some aerial topography images that we have of this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12053)|
| 3:21:07| I'm very grateful for the Hillside Ridge Top Protection Plan that protects this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| And I think as a commission, I would like to just make certain that we make certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12071)|
| 3:21:17| to approve the zoning that's appropriate to prevent things like this from happening to pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12077)|
| 3:21:24| I am personally going to vote against this piece of property for this to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12084)|
| 3:21:29| because I don't want any more damage happening to this ridge side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| Commissioner, I think the damage is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12096)|
| 3:21:41| Bringing it back to what it should be would be next to impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12101)|
| 3:21:46| Well, there could be some reforestation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| Like if we were to have a road that did not go over the top of this hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| we could keep the road down on the bottom side of it and do a reforestation on the top of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12112)|
| 3:22:00| I'm Steve Maddox. I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| My address is 100 Dalton Place Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12123)|
| 3:22:06| I'd like to address a couple of the questions that were just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12126)|
| 3:22:10| Most of the commissioners here, I believe, are familiar with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| We've been working on this for like 12 years, and we are right now at a point to where it is time to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12134)|
| 3:22:21| Ninety percent of the discussion I've sat here and listened to this afternoon has been about Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12141)|
| 3:22:28| Lack of schools, lack of roads, lack of water and sewer, lack of TVA bringing the power line through, and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12148)|
| 3:22:37| This development improves all the roads in that entire area, all the access into Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12157)|
| 3:22:45| including we're working with the state of Tennessee to completely develop the walk road interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12165)|
| 3:22:53| redesign of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12173)|
| 3:22:56| We're working with TVA on the correct way to bring those power lines through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| because they wanted to bring them right up the middle and come right on up through Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12180)|
| 3:23:05| We've helped them go an alternate route that's not as damaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| We're working with West Knox Utility, and we are contributing several million dollars to the new pump station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12189)|
| 3:23:17| the new water lines, and all the new sewer lines that serve that whole end of that area down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| And we're also working with LCUB on bringing the power up through there and tying it in with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12203)|
| 3:23:31| So this development finances a numerous million dollars worth of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12211)|
| 3:23:40| that's going to help that entire end of the county and solves a big majority of the problems that you've heard here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12220)|
| 3:23:48| We don't have a development plan. Have you filed a development plan yet, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12228)|
| 3:23:54| No, we've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12234)|
| 3:23:57| Because there's still some things that when we go do final layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12237)|
| 3:24:03| there's still some parcels that we don't know exactly what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12243)|
| 3:24:08| Let me address what you're talking about and kind of bring it back to what Steve said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12248)|
| 3:24:12| That power line slated basically would go over the top of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12252)|
| 3:24:16| Now we can denude the entire top of the hill with a 150-foot wide strip of power lines on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12256)|
| 3:24:22| or we can grade it down and start putting some things into the development that appeal to people from the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12262)|
| 3:24:30| instead of having high-voltage TVA power lines running right across the hill that we're talking about not cutting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12270)|
| 3:24:38| TVA's already got a plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| We're talking about a road right now, sir, not a power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| We're talking about a road right now, not a power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| But you're saying don't bring the road, don't cut that hill down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| The power line's going right at the crest of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| I know, but I'm not educated enough on power lines or what's going to allow and what's not going to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| but I do know and I have read the file about what's going to happen with the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| To construct that road, you're going to take 100 feet off that top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| Ma'am, that's exactly accurate. We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| But what I'm saying, the alternative is you may not be familiar with power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| but I guarantee you've seen power lines that have a 150-foot wide strip clear cut through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12314)|
| 3:25:21| I know, but our application is based on this road, not on a power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12321)|
| 3:25:24| Yes, ma'am, but we are cutting that down and working with TVA to make sure that power line doesn't do what you're wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12324)|
| 3:25:31| is create some visual issue with hilltop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| And that's the hilltop protection, that's the reason it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| Well, I think the visual issue's already there, but it's going to be a lot worse by the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12337)|
| 3:25:41| Well, I think when we get done with this, I don't think, I know when we get done with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12341)|
| 3:25:46| the amenity package that's delivered to the community is going to be much more beneficial than a 90-foot cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12346)|
| 3:25:55| Now, I'm not trying to be argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| We just finished one at Exit 407 in Sevier County where there was a huge cut there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12356)|
| 3:26:01| and that property had been under development for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| and now they're getting ready to generate another 50,000 vehicles a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| that's going to really improve that whole intersection because there's other things working on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| So there are some of these things that are necessary to happen in order to make sure that property can be at its best and highest use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12372)|
| 3:26:22| Right now, we can bring the road 15 ways to Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| I've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| But to bring the size of paths and the size of things that are needed for the development, we're going to have to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12388)|
| 3:26:35| Now, unless you all want to change your regulations to allow us steeper road grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| I mean, we can go do some of that stuff too and lessen the cut, but that's not indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| Well, what about keeping the road lower and not going up over the hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12405)|
| 3:26:49| There is no lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| I mean, we can go along the existing road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| Go around the side or not even go over the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| And so we put it around the side, and now we have a road along the side of the hill with side slopes that extend down 50, 60, 70 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12414)|
| 3:27:03| and cut slopes on the upper side that extend up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| I do this somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| We design interstates for a living and roadways for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| and going along the side of the hill creates a lot of that same terrible visual impact that you're looking at trying to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12430)|
| 3:27:17| Side of the hill, over the hill, we're still going to have huge amounts of cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12437)|
| 3:27:20| I'm not trying to, again, be argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| I'm just telling you what the reality of grading in different directions is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| Well, whatever happens, I do hope that there's going to be a reforestation effort of that hillside once whatever happens today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12447)|
| 3:27:34| and whatever happens with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12454)|
| 3:27:43| Commissioner Myers, will you conclude your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| I remember Mr. Maddox applied, and we had this discussion a couple years ago on this property about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12469)|
| 3:27:56| there was a lot of discussion about whether we would do a planned zone or do what he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12476)|
| 3:28:02| And he, engineers, and he made a good case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| He, after a meeting like we've been in today, convinced us all that this was the best way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12486)|
| 3:28:12| and I think the development is for a sports development, baseball, basketball, all these hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12492)|
| 3:28:19| kind of a destination-type development for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12499)|
| 3:28:24| And I think there was some of the Knox County government individuals that are backing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12504)|
| 3:28:31| and so that's kind of how we got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12511)|
| 3:28:35| But I think that the case about that hill coming down to account for this development was made several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12515)|
| 3:28:44| and I know you weren't there then or whatever, and I still agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| I typically am right there with you on chopping off the top of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12527)|
| 3:28:52| It's not the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| But in this case, the no-review zoning that is in place now, we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12534)|
| 3:29:01| And we had a long meeting, a long discussion, and at the end of the day, it was voted that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12541)|
| 3:29:07| So I hope that everything that was anticipated out of that meeting will still come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12547)|
| 3:29:15| But I think that's kind of how we got where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12555)|
| 3:29:23| No other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12563)|
| 3:29:24| Sure, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| I'll make a motion to approve variances 1, 2, and 4 in the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12566)|
| 3:29:32| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| will not create a traffic hazard, and deny variance 3 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12575)|
| 3:29:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12580)|

| 3:32:26| and I could go into respiratory failure at any time. And the fumes and all the stuff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12746)|
| 3:32:38| going to be coming from that service station, the gas fumes, diesel, the motor exhaust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12758)|
| 3:32:45| it would absolutely kill me. I've only got certain days that I can sit outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12765)|
| 3:32:53| and it's not every day that I can do that. But this would eliminate it totally where I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12773)|
| 3:33:04| get in and out. I can't walk far. I can only walk about 30 feet. Then I have to have a wheelchair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12784)|
| 3:33:14| to finish my walk in. And there's hot rodders. The four lane is a donut circle place. It's never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12794)|
| 3:33:30| been patrolled. You go out there and you see where they circled and circled and circled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12810)|
| 3:33:38| And it's just a mess. And we hear all the traffic now and it's going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12818)|
| 3:33:52| We have all the school traffic from about 7 to about 7.15 or a little later or 7.45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12832)|
| 3:34:03| hour or a little later. We can't even get out of our driveway to leave early to go to the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12843)|
| 3:34:12| I have a lot of doctor's appointments that are 7.30 that have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12852)|
| 3:34:19| I have, I mean, it's only a 15 minute drive to them, but I have to leave right around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| 6.30 to get to these places on time because I can't make it through the school traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12865)|
| 3:34:36| and so forth, people going to work. And this traffic that's going to come out and exit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12876)|
| 3:34:43| the Johnson Road to go east, it's really going to put a damper on things. We don't even have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12883)|
| 3:34:52| a crossing guard or anything like that. And people have no respect for speeding. They run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12892)|
| 3:35:00| these stop signs just like they're not even there. We've been hit rear-ended a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12900)|
| 3:35:08| And it's just not feasible for them to bring all that on me. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12908)|
| 3:35:22| I'm very heartbroken that this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12922)|
| 3:35:30| We hear everything. We've had multiple break-ins. The neighbors have. So far, I've been blessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12930)|
| 3:35:40| of not having something stolen right out of the house or out of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12940)|
| 3:35:46| But when all this traffic starts into that store, if my garage door's up, everybody sees what I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12946)|
| 3:35:55| in my garage. There's no hiding it unless I leave the door down. And you very can't leave the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12955)|
| 3:36:02| well, can't leave the door down because you got to get your vehicle in and out to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12962)|
| 3:36:10| And I just can't see it happening. And I would appreciate it if you all would consider my health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12970)|
| 3:36:22| Like I say, I've got several lung diseases and I'm in respiratory failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12982)|
| 3:36:30| And if any of you know what that's like, it's not fun. You just smother to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12990)|
| 3:36:38| And I guess that's, well, you're talking about the noise. I've seen this week where they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=12998)|
| 3:36:51| these cameras up on Sutherland Avenue. If this store's going in, why can't you put those cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13011)|
| 3:37:00| up down here to control the noise that we get from here? And getting back to the four lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13020)|
| 3:37:14| people coming off of Ball Camp Pike, coming on to the four lane, they have to spin their tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13034)|
| 3:37:24| 90% of the people that go through there have to spin their tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13044)|
| 3:37:29| Mr. West, I hate to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13049)|
| 3:37:32| It's really hard on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13052)|
| 3:37:37| Mr. West, your time is up. And Mr. Murphy, I think, wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13057)|
| 3:37:44| Connie West, is she available too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| Mr. Murphy, grant two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13066)|
| 3:37:56| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| Ms. West, do you have anything additional you want to respond to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13080)|
| 3:38:05| I'm just asking you to leave our neighborhood a neighborhood and not a grocery store. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13085)|
| 3:38:12| grocery store a mile from here at Shod Road and Oak Ridge Highway. We don't need a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13092)|
| 3:38:19| here. And the noise from it and the extra pollution would be a really burden upon our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13099)|
| 3:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| Thank you. Mr. Murphy, two minutes. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| additional time will be allowed to Mr. Hunt as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13115)|
| 3:38:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be pretty brief. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13118)|
| 3:38:43| So this is a use on review hearing. And in the CN zone, there's uses that are allowed by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13123)|
| 3:38:49| and uses that require review. This involves three uses that require review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13129)|
| 3:38:54| fueling pump or fueling station with convenience store, restaurant, and a drive-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13134)|
| 3:38:58| And so you as planning commission in this role are really acting at maximum authority level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13138)|
| 3:39:04| scrutinize, evaluate, look at the impacts and hazards created, and then approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13144)|
| 3:39:10| approve modifications or deny an application. Very quickly, the types of hazards that this does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13150)|
| 3:39:17| that use next to residences and the existing zoning is agricultural next to it. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13157)|
| 3:39:23| that's what you're working with. So, you know, that's how you're evaluating this in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13163)|
| 3:39:29| lens. The hazards are really, they involve types of trespass that happen when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13169)|
| 3:39:34| a commercial business that's intense next to residential. There's light trespass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| both from like headlights for vehicles. And you've got 2,700 vehicles a day estimated to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13178)|
| 3:39:43| through this. Plus you've also got lighting from the side as well. And living next to a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13183)|
| 3:39:50| even though it's across the street and technically 800 feet away from my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| that thing is very brightly lit. It, you know, and it, until I got them to finally shine their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13194)|
| 3:39:59| lights down, you know, cast light into my house. So that's why I actually think a lighting plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13199)|
| 3:40:04| is a really good condition to put on here. So you have light trespass, you have noise trespass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13204)|
| 3:40:09| and vehicles are really loud. Lots of people, you know, motorcycle blaring with its stereo is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13209)|
| 3:40:14| going to be pretty loud. You have fumes. Mr. West indicated he's got a pretty significant impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13214)|
| 3:40:20| from fumes next to him. And then, you know, one other one is litter. I've got a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13220)|
| 3:40:26| waggles trash that I pick up along the road next to me. So this does create it. I suggested some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13226)|
| 3:40:32| conditions that could be helpful in this case. I think this is really a case where you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13232)|
| 3:40:38| intense uses being asked for, and it's an opportunity to really, you know, apply some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13238)|
| 3:40:42| conditions to try and mitigate that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13242)|
| 3:40:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, commissioners. Appreciate your service and your endurance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| We are a family corporation. My son-in-law, Trent Langston, and my daughter, who had to leave to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13254)|

| 3:41:28| Pat, did you, were you able to get that in their packet this afternoon, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13288)|
| 3:41:32| Yes, I forwarded it to the commission members. Okay. That's the format of the store that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13292)|
| 3:41:37| would like to bring to this area. We think it has a much more residential look, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| than a flat roof. And, you know, stone drive it, hardy plank and brick and texture block exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13301)|
| 3:41:48| for texture to have a more residential feel. We are aware that there are neighbors to our back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13308)|
| 3:41:55| that are residential. We have a very rigorous landscape plan that exceeds the CN requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13315)|
| 3:42:02| and we will also agree to put in a fence that'll be six feet tall. If you'll see on the profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13322)|
| 3:42:09| there, our store will be below grade, so the lights from the parking lot will be below the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13329)|
| 3:42:14| existing residence. And we'll also put a fence up that'll be about six foot tall, which will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13334)|
| 3:42:21| the total obstruction about 12 feet on our back side next to our neighbor that has a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13341)|

| 3:42:35| this use on review, so I did not get that submitted to the lighting review folks until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13355)|
| 3:42:45| got everything finalized with optional engineering on driveways and stuff. But we are aware and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13365)|
| 3:42:51| familiar with designing stuff so the light does not bleed like Mr. Murphy had described off our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13371)|

| 3:43:05| landscaping and the fence, we think that will take care of that. As far as the drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13385)|
| 3:43:10| noise, we can also use additional focus speakers that keep the sound of the speaker focused at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13390)|
| 3:43:18| car where it's at and not project past the property line to address that. We are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13398)|
| 3:43:23| we've got to have sewer water. We are aware this does not give us a sign permit. We've got to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13403)|
| 3:43:29| all that with Knox County engineering and the building codes, but we're asking for the use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13409)|

| 3:43:56| so we're trying to design for what the needs of the community are at the present time. We do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| we'll be a good neighbor and we'll support the schools as we do in every community that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13440)|

| 3:44:21| the only one that I really think would be good to add in as a seventh condition really would be just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13461)|
| 3:44:26| a, instead of spelling out ABCD, just require a lighting plan to be submitted that addresses these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13466)|
| 3:44:34| issues just because it is close to the property. I, you know, again, knowing where that Weigels is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13474)|
| 3:44:40| and how bright it is, I mean, obviously we want to make sure that the residents behind it are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13480)|
| 3:44:46| shielded from light on the house side, so I see Commissioner Adams, before I make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13486)|
| 3:44:52| a motion, kick it over to her for any additional comments, but I would want to add in a seventh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13492)|
| 3:44:59| condition for a lighting plan. What about the fence? Commissioner Smith, if I might speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13499)|
| 3:45:04| in Maryville our regulation is one, there can't be more than one foot candle at the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13504)|
| 3:45:10| and that's what we're used to designing for. That's a standard that you measure right at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13510)|
| 3:45:14| property. And that's why I don't want to spell it out so specifically. It's just that you submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13514)|
| 3:45:20| that as part of the condition with all of those things so that somebody can, when it comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13520)|
| 3:45:25| we have all of that to look at. But, sorry. You didn't mention the fence. Is that? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13525)|
| 3:45:33| because he had said that they were going to do the fence. Well, but it's not on the plan. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13533)|
| 3:45:37| that's not that we don't trust him. The fence would extend from the, as you're looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13537)|
| 3:45:44| plan, from the edge of the dumpster area across to the edge of the tank pad, that's that square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13544)|
| 3:45:51| concrete pad you see up there, the modeled concrete there from there over, and we'll put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13551)|
| 3:45:59| that along the property line subject to, I'm assuming the five foot utilities, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| Knox County will want us to stay out of. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13564)|
| 3:46:13| Thank you. And I appreciate you looking at what are some of the ways that this plan could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13573)|
| 3:46:19| made better, less of an impact on the area that it's proposed for. I want to go back a few feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13579)|
| 3:46:28| from that because it is a use on review. It's a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13588)|
| 3:46:37| but it's not permitted by right. It's a use on review. And the plan, you know, when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13597)|
| 3:46:45| it and you hear from the applicant, you know, it looks like they're doing a lot of really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13605)|
| 3:46:49| things and trying to be very thoughtful in that. But the question I think that first has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13609)|
| 3:46:55| asked is, is it right for this spot? And when I think neighborhood commercial that would fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13615)|
| 3:47:01| in that area, it's not a heavy intensive use like fuel station where there's traffic constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13621)|
| 3:47:09| and all the other things that have been brought up with the light and the garbage, etc., and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13629)|
| 3:47:13| noise. It's some other lighter use that would be more appropriate for that area. So my first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13633)|
| 3:47:20| question is, you know, is this really the right place for a use that is this intensive? I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13640)|
| 3:47:25| say it probably isn't. Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf. I agree with what Ms. Adams had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13645)|
| 3:47:39| This is, I think it's a bad idea to put any kind of an intense commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13659)|
| 3:47:48| piece of property right next to residential. And they just shouldn't back up to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13668)|
| 3:47:58| if this is a small pickup store or something like that. But it doesn't get much more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13678)|
| 3:48:07| than what is being proposed right now. You know, it goes on, it doesn't quit at 5 o'clock in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13687)|
| 3:48:16| afternoon and everybody goes home. It goes on until 11 o'clock at night or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13696)|
| 3:48:24| And then you have the problem with the lighting and the noise. And 5 o'clock in the morning when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13704)|
| 3:48:32| they pick up the dumpster and dump it, that wakes you up. You know, it's just a bad use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13712)|
| 3:48:40| for a residential area. I couldn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13720)|
| 3:48:48| You can take all these additional conditions. I couldn't, I can't support it in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13728)|
| 3:48:58| Commissioner Graf, the reason we want to be there is the fact that the traffic is projected to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13738)|
| 3:49:04| 16 to 17,000 cars per day, which is what Chaud Road is carrying now with that two lane. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13744)|
| 3:49:11| nature of the area will change no matter what. We did approach the folks behind us to see if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13751)|
| 3:49:17| would want it to sell. But out of deference to them, they are in very ill health. The wife has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13757)|
| 3:49:23| cancer and we did not want to bother them. In the midst of all that, she said that she did not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13763)|
| 3:49:28| any discussion. We proposed to buy it and move them. I don't mean to be argumentative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13768)|
| 3:49:34| but that's one piece of property. There's more than one residence there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13774)|
| 3:49:43| you can't, you can't just say, okay, I wanted to buy that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13783)|
| 3:49:50| But we're not going to affect anybody else because you do. Sometimes you affect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13790)|
| 3:49:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13799)|
| 3:50:06| Yeah. What hours of operation do you anticipate for the drive through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13806)|
| 3:50:10| 6 to 12, 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13810)|
| 3:50:13| Or maybe 5 to 11. With the school traffic, we'd need to be open probably by 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13813)|
| 3:50:21| for the folks that are coming through and then probably close by midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13821)|
| 3:50:25| With COVID and the economy, some of our stores have been closing at 10 to be quite frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13825)|
| 3:50:31| How important is your drive through to your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13831)|
| 3:50:34| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13834)|
| 3:50:34| How important is your drive through to your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13834)|
| 3:50:37| We think very important going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13839)|
| 3:50:40| I mean, it is a four lane highway there. I agree, but when I look at the map and how close the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13840)|
| 3:50:46| residents, their house is really going to be right behind where that drive through is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13846)|
| 3:50:52| they have to hear speakers and orders and going. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13852)|
| 3:50:58| The noise kind of bothers me to think about that being that close to someone where they sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13858)|
| 3:51:07| I don't know. That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13867)|
| 3:51:11| Well, if you can improve it with the drive through, we'll have to go back and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| our projections and go from there. But we're designing stores now in Maryville with drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13874)|
| 3:51:21| through with them, with the sound restrictions, so that doesn't carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13881)|
| 3:51:30| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13890)|
| 3:51:31| Is the drive through the same hours of operation as the entire gas station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13891)|
| 3:51:35| Probably not. No, we think it's probably going to be more like six to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13895)|
| 3:51:40| six to four as the restaurant, follow the restaurant hours. We don't know. We don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13900)|
| 3:51:48| if there's going to be requests for other items through it or not. It's from the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13908)|
| 3:51:54| but we wanted those available like milk, some of the more staple items close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13914)|
| 3:51:59| so that we could fill those orders if they were requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| I don't see how this gas station would be any more detrimental than the four lane highway that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13922)|
| 3:52:08| being built adjacent to all these houses to begin with. And we'll probably see plans change over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13928)|
| 3:52:14| time once the highway is done, and this will probably fit five, 10 years from now much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13934)|
| 3:52:19| than it will maybe right now. But I think it's a decent plan. With what Michelle sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13939)|
| 3:52:29| the screening, the landscaping, it seems like there's a decent elevation change from the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13949)|
| 3:52:34| I don't know if we need a fence unless that, I don't know if the fence affects sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13954)|
| 3:52:38| then maybe that would be good. But in terms of the light from cars driving through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13958)|
| 3:52:42| I don't think that would make a difference because they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13962)|
| 3:52:47| shining right on that hill next to the house. So I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13967)|
| 3:52:53| The traffic study also showed that the traffic light was warranted with school traffic whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13973)|
| 3:52:59| we're there or not, which is why I think there's already crosswalks marked in the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13979)|
| 3:53:08| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13988)|
| 3:53:08| I think the difference between the highway plus this proposed usage and just the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=13988)|
| 3:53:23| and some other type of neighborhood commercial is that you could end up with a more effective buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14003)|
| 3:53:31| from the highway with a small shopping center, something that has different hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14011)|
| 3:53:37| and that's why I believe the intensity of this particular usage is actually worse than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14017)|
| 3:53:44| more impactful than just the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14024)|
| 3:53:51| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14031)|
| 3:53:54| Thank you, Chair. I would like to make a motion to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14034)|
| 3:54:04| Can you add the fence on there and the lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| Would you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| Okay, to include a fence and the required lighting plan to be submitted with concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14049)|
| 3:54:20| Okay, the item 11 in the suggested additional conditions for item 26. Is that what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14060)|
| 3:54:25| asking for? I think so. And I think the fence, Mr. Hunt, would you repeat those please, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14065)|
| 3:54:33| I think Director Brooks wants to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| I think staff could use some clarification on the lighting condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14075)|
| 3:54:40| And if I could, just to add to that motion, and then I'll second it. On number 11, I'd like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14080)|
| 3:54:46| to just read, require a lighting plan to be submitted with a concept plan that addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14086)|
| 3:54:51| A, B, C, and D, not that meets all those requirements that just addresses it so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14091)|
| 3:54:57| actually can see what that lighting plan is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14097)|
| 3:55:01| Are you referring to the submittal by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14101)|
| 3:55:04| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14104)|
| 3:55:05| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| So take item 11 and just strike meet requirements and just substitute in addresses the A, B, C, D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14107)|
| 3:55:19| I'm not sure in terms of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14119)|
| 3:55:23| I can agree to everything on the property line. I will not consent to restrict the light levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14123)|
| 3:55:29| interior because our reliability insurance requires high light levels. If we have ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14129)|
| 3:55:36| folks coming on, they've got to be able to see the differences for fueling and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14136)|
| 3:55:42| We can keep the lights away so they're not glaring, but I will meet lighting requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14142)|
| 3:55:50| around the periphery but not internal. And that's why I wanted the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| addresses it so that you have that opportunity to say, here's why we're doing it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14153)|
| 3:55:58| I don't want to pigeonhole you in. I just wanted that you're addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14158)|
| 3:56:01| all of those things in your final lighting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14161)|
| 3:56:06| I'd hope to have that ready for you today, but I just didn't get it in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14166)|
| 3:56:11| We've got to take another crack at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14171)|
| 3:56:14| Okay, so motion to approve per staff recommendation with additional conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14174)|
| 3:56:22| related to this handout given to us by Mr. Murphy, item 7, installation and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14182)|
| 3:56:29| of an opaque fence from, I'm just going to say opaque fence, and item 11 that he would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14189)|
| 3:56:39| as it relates to item 11, he would address the, I guess the sub-items in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14199)|
| 3:56:52| That's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14212)|
| 3:56:53| So I just need a little clarification. Address or comply with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| Address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14217)|
| 3:57:00| So is the issue light trespass, addressing light trespass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14220)|
| 3:57:05| Okay, I think that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| And what was the height on the fence, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| Oh, six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14230)|
| 3:57:11| Six feet, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14231)|
| 3:57:12| Yeah, my question on the east side is agricultural and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14232)|
| 3:57:17| I don't know that you want us to put a fence there just yet until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14237)|
| 3:57:20| if it's approved for residential, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14240)|
| 3:57:23| But I would think you'd want that to stay open for, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14243)|
| 3:57:30| I wish somebody else would have made this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14250)|
| 3:57:33| I could change the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14253)|
| 3:57:36| I actually also have a question that might correspond to the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14256)|
| 3:57:40| The lighting plan would typically be required for the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14260)|
| 3:57:44| so I'm unclear whether you all want the lighting plan to come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| or if it's okay that it addresses all this when it goes forward to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14268)|
| 3:57:52| So just that clarification point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14272)|
| 3:57:53| I think the staff, not necessarily back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14273)|
| 3:57:57| I assume so, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14277)|
| 3:57:58| Correct, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14278)|
| 3:57:59| Yes, but some of the wording made me kind of wonder otherwise, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| Thanks for your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14282)|
| 3:58:08| So we got a motion, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| You've heard the motion, the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14295)|
| 3:58:16| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14296)|
| 3:58:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14298)|
| 3:58:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14299)|
| 3:58:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14300)|
| 3:58:22| Is that three no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| Commissioner Graft, Adams, and Smith, and Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14303)|
| 3:58:29| Motion carries with four no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| Thank you, Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| Michelle, the lighting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14317)|
| 3:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| Chairman, I want to thank you for the staff has been very helpful in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14320)|
| 3:58:45| to walk us through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14325)|
| 3:58:46| We've never had to do a use on review on anything, so they've been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14326)|
| 3:58:50| We won't take any credit that the fact that you came from Maryville first, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14330)|
| 3:58:55| we don't want to brag on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| All right, thank you, Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| Next item is item number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14339)|
| 3:59:05| This is an amendment to the City Zoning Amendment Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| and request an amendment to the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14351)|
| 3:59:13| appendix B, article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| uses to add drug treatment clinics to the CG, general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14355)|
| 3:59:20| CH, highway commercial, and CR, regional commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14360)|
| 3:59:25| zoning districts as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14365)|
| 3:59:28| I'll turn this over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14368)|
| 3:59:34| I don't have any other specific comments beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| what I shared with you all in agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| but we do have someone signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14379)|
| 3:59:45| Ms. Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14385)|
| 3:59:57| Ms. Pershing, if you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| We enjoyed your last presentation so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| We're glad to have you back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14404)|
| 4:00:05| I appreciate your time, and I'm going to be very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14405)|
| 4:00:08| because I know you all have been sitting for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| My name is Karen Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| I'm Executive Director of Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14413)|
| 4:00:17| which I've served in that capacity for the past 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14417)|
| 4:00:22| So as of today, 434 of our neighbors have died of suspected drug overdoses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14422)|
| 4:00:32| Compared to 383 in 2020 and 259 in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14432)|
| 4:00:39| These deaths are preventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14439)|
| 4:00:43| We are going in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14443)|
| 4:00:46| Opioid use disorders are continuing to ravage our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14446)|
| 4:00:50| and it all began with the aggressive marketing campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14450)|
| 4:00:54| from the pharmaceutical industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14454)|
| 4:00:57| with a push to prescribe powerful Schedule II narcotics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14457)|
| 4:01:01| for any type of painful condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| stating falsely that they were not addictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14464)|
| 4:01:08| Since that time, the epidemic has shifted from prescribed narcotics to street drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14468)|
| 4:01:13| such as heroin and fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| This issue is driving our increases in homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14476)|
| 4:01:21| economic distress, and criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14481)|
| 4:01:26| While we may not have all the answers to the complex issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14486)|
| 4:01:29| of substance use disorders, here's what we do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14489)|
| 4:01:33| Evidence-based treatment works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14493)|
| 4:01:36| and recovery is not only possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14496)|
| 4:01:39| but is happening every single day in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14499)|
| 4:01:43| What is considered the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14503)|
| 4:01:48| Medication-assisted therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| This therapeutic model combines FDA-approved and DEA-regulated medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14511)|
| 4:01:58| proven to quell the powerful cravings of the addicted brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14518)|
| 4:02:03| with individual and group therapy sessions in outpatient settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14523)|
| 4:02:08| Unlike the narcotics that cause many to become addicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14528)|
| 4:02:12| the medications used to treat opioid use disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14532)|
| 4:02:16| are highly regulated by the DEA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| and are stigmatized more than the disease itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| Medications are used to effectively treat numerous physical and mental conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14544)|
| 4:02:31| where individuals go in and out of medical clinics and psychiatric offices daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14551)|
| 4:02:38| and then on to pharmacies to get those medications filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14558)|
| 4:02:42| This is no different than an outpatient treatment clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14562)|
| 4:02:46| Patients are seen by licensed healthcare providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14566)|
| 4:02:50| then are diagnosed, treatment plans are developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14570)|
| 4:02:54| and patients are prescribed medications to help them manage their conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14574)|
| 4:03:00| These outpatient clinics must obtain licensure standards of not only their professional boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14580)|
| 4:03:07| but must also apply and receive approval from the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14587)|
| 4:03:12| of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14592)|
| 4:03:15| Federally, the DEA has to approve and issue an X waiver for any physician or extender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14595)|
| 4:03:24| in order for them to be able to prescribe these treatment medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14604)|
| 4:03:28| This is a highly regulated industry, especially when medications are prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14608)|
| 4:03:35| During the recode process, we essentially zone evidence-based treatment out of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14615)|
| 4:03:41| but yet we have some of the highest addiction rates in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14621)|
| 4:03:45| The McNabb Center estimates that we are only able to serve 11% of the present need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14625)|
| 4:03:52| The proposed amendment allows the establishment of state-approved licensed clinics and providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14632)|
| 4:03:59| to open clinics to assist individuals in obtaining treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| These are commercial zones that would preserve the concerns of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14644)|
| 4:04:10| The important thing to remember here is the individuals in treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| are no longer actively using drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14654)|
| 4:04:18| When they are not in treatment is when we need to be concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14658)|
| 4:04:23| I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14663)|
| 4:04:27| this evening and happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14667)|
| 4:04:34| Ms. Pershing, thank you so much for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14674)|
| 4:04:37| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| Thank you, and I just want you all to know, I mean, what Karen and I go way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14680)|
| 4:04:45| When I first started working, when I was in office with Karen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14685)|
| 4:04:51| Knox County had some of the most pain clinics in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14691)|
| 4:04:57| Through the work that Karen and the MDC team have done, that has been cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14697)|
| 4:05:02| We've closed the bad providers, the bad actors in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14702)|
| 4:05:07| Unfortunately, it's just an issue that is going to be with us for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14707)|
| 4:05:11| So, Karen, I just want to say publicly thank you for the work that you, the MDC staff does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14711)|
| 4:05:16| you know, Helen Ross McNabb, everybody, just in trying to help those in our community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14716)|
| 4:05:23| through a lot of times, through no fault of their own, got addicted to a substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14723)|
| 4:05:27| through just simple things as surgery, but it put them on a path of a damaging path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14727)|
| 4:05:33| And we just thank you for what you all do in just helping those in our community recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14733)|
| 4:05:39| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14739)|
| 4:05:46| Thank you, Ms. Pershing. I appreciate all your work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14746)|
| 4:05:49| and thank you, Commissioner Smith, for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14749)|
| 4:05:52| I think we had a really good discussion about this at the agenda review the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14752)|
| 4:05:59| I appreciate, especially some of our county commissioners that acknowledge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14759)|
| 4:06:04| this same effort needs to happen countywide, not just in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14764)|
| 4:06:08| And I hope county administration is hearing that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14768)|
| 4:06:13| and that that can be addressed here on the planning staff sometime in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14773)|
| 4:06:19| When I go back and look at the zones that we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14779)|
| 4:06:24| I actually talked to Director Brooks this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14784)|
| 4:06:28| It looks like prior to recode that there was a definition in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14788)|
| 4:06:34| that allowed for, it was specifically for methadone treatment facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14794)|
| 4:06:41| and they were on an outpatient basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| So I think that that definition prior to recode kind of correlates with what definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14803)|
| 4:06:49| we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| It was only allowed in the 02 and the 03 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14811)|
| 4:06:55| There was some discussion about how this was handled before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| It looks like during recode, the only thing they do differently is they separated out the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14818)|
| 4:07:06| So now there's a definition for residential treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| and then there's also a definition for outpatient treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14828)|
| 4:07:11| which is what we're addressing right now with the drug treatment facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14831)|
| 4:07:15| Currently, the amendment allows for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14835)|
| 4:07:19| it's going to be permitted in the zoning ordinance in CH, CR, and CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14839)|
| 4:07:28| And when in just looking at the applicability of opening up all three zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14848)|
| 4:07:37| of opening up all three zones, I am supportive of permitting it by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14857)|
| 4:07:45| in both the CR and the CH zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14865)|
| 4:07:48| But I looked at the CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14868)|
| 4:07:51| And when you look at CG, you're looking at areas all along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14871)|
| 4:07:56| Western Avenue, Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14876)|
| 4:07:58| It's the corridors that lead through the areas of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14878)|
| 4:08:03| And I looked at other uses and if they're permitted or they're special use in those zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14883)|
| 4:08:10| in the CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14890)|
| 4:08:12| And things that are permitted by special use or use on review in the CG zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14892)|
| 4:08:20| but is permitted in the other zones are things like gas stations, car washes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14900)|
| 4:08:26| which came up last month, drive-thru facilities, self-storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14906)|
| 4:08:32| vehicle repair shops, vehicle rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14912)|
| 4:08:36| And these are all examples of uses in that CG zone that require a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14916)|
| 4:08:45| So I guess what I feel like at this point, I mean, I think we're doing an amazing job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14925)|
| 4:08:50| of increasing the ability to have drug treatment facilities throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14930)|
| 4:08:55| But my reservation is by allowing this as a permitted use in the CG zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14935)|
| 4:09:02| and not a special use in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14942)|
| 4:09:05| And so I want to make a motion, I've heard of this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14945)|
| 4:09:13| that we are going to approve staff's recommendation amending the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14953)|
| 4:09:20| of the drug treatment facility in the CG zone to a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14960)|
| 4:09:24| and not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14964)|
| 4:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14967)|
| 4:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14976)|
| 4:09:37| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14979)|
| 4:09:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| I've got a comment, not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14984)|
| 4:09:45| So we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14985)|
| 4:09:48| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill, then we'll get to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14988)|
| 4:09:54| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| I've said a lot about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14996)|
| 4:09:59| I think this may be the most important issue that's ever been brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=14999)|
| 4:10:03| I mean, we're a country in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15003)|
| 4:10:06| We're a community in crisis and our families are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15006)|
| 4:10:10| And I don't think it's fair to discriminate how we treat illness, whether it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15010)|
| 4:10:18| you know, if it's a physical illness or if it's the mental illness tied to addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15018)|
| 4:10:25| And there's nothing that requires more resources, time, and attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15025)|
| 4:10:31| than this issue that we're faced today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15031)|
| 4:10:34| And this very issue, and this is an exaggerative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15034)|
| 4:10:39| I just, I don't know why we haven't faced it head on like we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| Like we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15045)|
| 4:10:46| I mean, these are, and you've heard it, you're sick of hearing it from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15046)|
| 4:10:50| 434 people on the forefront of the prime of their life, primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15050)|
| 4:10:58| Those are the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15058)|
| 4:10:59| The 20, you know, it's probably 24 to 40 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| Those are the ones we're losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| And yet we do everything for the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15066)|
| 4:11:08| It's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15068)|
| 4:11:09| It'll be diminished soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15069)|
| 4:11:11| You know, we've lost 960 people over a two year period to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15071)|
| 4:11:16| That's soon going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15076)|
| 4:11:18| We treat them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15078)|
| 4:11:19| We'll treat them in parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15079)|
| 4:11:20| You get a shot anywhere you want to get a shot for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| I don't understand, in all due respect to Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15083)|
| 4:11:30| why we need a special use provision for CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15090)|
| 4:11:35| Many of those uses that she mentioned were intensive exterior uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15095)|
| 4:11:40| This is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15100)|
| 4:11:41| It's not going to change the character of our commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15101)|
| 4:11:46| And I would just ask and hope that we'll all give the necessary attention and commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15106)|
| 4:11:52| to our communities because our families are falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15112)|
| 4:11:55| Our communities are falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| And if we don't act with all of our available resources, it will only get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15117)|
| 4:12:03| And I'm not predicting the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| I'm predicting the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| 2017, 293.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| 2018, 294.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| 2020, we had 383.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15131)|
| 4:12:14| Almost a 47% jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| And today, 434.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| It used to be it was like the addicts graduated to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15138)|
| 4:12:25| Today, with fentanyl, they're on an expressway to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15145)|
| 4:12:28| We've got to get folks in treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15148)|
| 4:12:31| The vast majority is mental illness tied to this addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| And I just hope that you'll I hope that you won't support this motion and that you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15155)|
| 4:12:39| support a motion that I'll make if this one fails to allow it permitted in CG and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15159)|
| 4:12:47| the others per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15167)|
| 4:12:50| Miss Pershing, just from your experience, have these facilities had any issues surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15170)|
| 4:12:58| them in terms of crime or in the neighboring properties or community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15178)|
| 4:13:03| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15183)|
| 4:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15186)|
| 4:13:07| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15187)|
| 4:13:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15190)|
| 4:13:11| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15191)|
| 4:13:12| I've had my light up for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| Yeah, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15194)|
| 4:13:16| It's a little bit of a bummer because I was trying to get the first motion out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15196)|
| 4:13:19| But, you know, honestly, I think that this should I wish it were more broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15199)|
| 4:13:24| But I was I was planning to make a motion to accept or vote in favor of it as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15204)|
| 4:13:32| And I completely agree that I think it's discriminatory to try to narrow down those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15212)|
| 4:13:38| zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15218)|
| 4:13:39| I think the places we need these are on the corridors and in the areas where there's public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15219)|
| 4:13:46| transit and where there's higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15226)|
| 4:13:49| So I I'm also against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15229)|
| 4:13:52| And I'm sorry, I don't mean to say that your motion is discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15232)|
| 4:13:56| I just mean that I think that it's we we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15236)|
| 4:14:01| You know, I think it's really it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15241)|
| 4:14:04| There's evidence all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15244)|
| 4:14:07| So I will also not be supporting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15247)|
| 4:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15251)|
| 4:14:12| Commissioner Scalzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15252)|
| 4:14:14| This is a staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| So what Amy was saying is that a similar type of clinic used to be allowed in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15260)|
| 4:14:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15264)|
| 4:14:25| And then was there consideration of putting that putting making this recommendation allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15265)|
| 4:14:31| in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15271)|
| 4:14:35| We looked at all of the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| I think one of the challenges with my opinion in terms of the office zones is that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15277)|
| 4:14:43| are considered buffers to residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| And so, you know, I do think that they are more appropriate along our main corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15285)|
| 4:14:51| that do have access to transit and other commercial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15291)|
| 4:14:55| There's a good deal of office along some of the arterial highways that potentially could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15295)|
| 4:15:00| be good spots for these kind of clinics as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15300)|
| 4:15:03| So if that's a requirement of having the clinics there to be along an arterial that would cancel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15303)|
| 4:15:10| out the buffer requirement or the buffer effect of some office, I think too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15310)|
| 4:15:14| So if anything, I might be in favor of as staff recommends and then maybe as a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15314)|
| 4:15:20| use for office, adding that to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15320)|
| 4:15:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15324)|
| 4:15:28| A question about the way the policy is written now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15328)|
| 4:15:34| Is there any is there anything in the policy that guides that they are not all clustered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15334)|
| 4:15:46| in one spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15346)|
| 4:15:47| And what I mean is in some governance past, there were there was a policy that came across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15347)|
| 4:15:56| about lending places that couldn't be within however many feet of one another or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15356)|
| 4:16:02| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15362)|
| 4:16:03| Is there anything in this change that would speak to the frequency of them so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15363)|
| 4:16:11| are spread out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15371)|
| 4:16:12| They're not all in one spot together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15372)|
| 4:16:15| I think the certificate of need would take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15375)|
| 4:16:20| I would also point out that this is different than lending facilities, which are predatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15380)|
| 4:16:24| and this is health care based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15384)|
| 4:16:26| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| And it's difficult for me to ask this question, but the perception is part of what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15390)|
| 4:16:37| to defeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15397)|
| 4:16:39| And so I'm thinking in terms of the current perception that the community has about these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15399)|
| 4:16:46| places, may we defeat some of that by making sure that they are spattered evenly, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15406)|
| 4:16:56| they're they're available to everybody as opposed to them always being clustered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15416)|
| 4:17:00| one spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15420)|
| 4:17:01| That's that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| Well, and if I could, Mr. Chair, I think if you go and look at the report that's out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15423)|
| 4:17:11| there, there is not a zip code that is not vastly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15431)|
| 4:17:18| These clinics are going to go where the people need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| And honestly, the people need help from west to east and north to south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15442)|
| 4:17:27| And if you look at where the overdoses are happening, it's not respective of any race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15447)|
| 4:17:34| political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15454)|
| 4:17:35| I mean, it's happening everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15455)|
| 4:17:36| So but this gets to the certificate of need that Commissioner Hill is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15456)|
| 4:17:40| So that's where that's where I think when you look at it from the medical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15460)|
| 4:17:44| these clinics are going to be going where there's clusters of people that they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15464)|
| 4:17:49| help to very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| And that's where what I know you're going to see them all over in every major corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15471)|
| 4:17:57| because the need is just that great in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15477)|
| 4:18:01| And I can tell you, from a mental health standpoint, if you want to know what's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15481)|
| 4:18:06| just in the last couple of months, the Children's Hospitals Alliance around the country are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15486)|
| 4:18:11| sounding the alarm on mental health crisis of what our children are being affected by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15491)|
| 4:18:17| That is adding to an adverse childhood experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15497)|
| 4:18:20| As those aces add up, that leads to more substance abuse in their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15500)|
| 4:18:25| So anybody who thinks we're just going to solve this right now, what the pandemic has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15505)|
| 4:18:30| caused in our children in the tsunami that's coming, I just hope everybody is fully aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15510)|
| 4:18:35| of what's what's rolling out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15515)|
| 4:18:38| It's you don't see a lot of it on the surface right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15518)|
| 4:18:40| We're seeing those numbers increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15520)|
| 4:18:42| But it is a massive tidal wave that is fixing to crash on our shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15522)|
| 4:18:46| So I just hope everybody fully grasps this isn't just an adult problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15526)|
| 4:18:52| This is starting now down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15532)|
| 4:18:53| We're seeing kids where I'm at as young as in elementary school that are starting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15533)|
| 4:18:59| experiment with substances now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| So it's coming and we need to all be ready for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15541)|
| 4:19:06| Chair recognizes Commissioner Meidas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15546)|
| 4:19:09| Yeah, I just want to comment that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15549)|
| 4:19:13| I don't feel like this suggestion by myself and this motion is discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15553)|
| 4:19:19| I think it's a zoning issue that we're talking about here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15559)|
| 4:19:23| I don't disagree with anything that anyone said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15563)|
| 4:19:27| But when I look at the intensive uses that are allowed in CG and that most of those or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15567)|
| 4:19:35| all of those are special use in that zone, you know, this is a situation where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15575)|
| 4:19:42| property by property, whether, you know, it's just going to allow for this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15582)|
| 4:19:49| the city of Knoxville, the city council to look at each property and decide if maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15589)|
| 4:19:56| a condition needs to apply to that property before approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15596)|
| 4:20:00| It's not saying that we're not allowing it or we're not going to, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15600)|
| 4:20:04| prevent drug treatment facilities from being at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15604)|
| 4:20:07| It's just saying that it's giving us one extra look before approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15607)|
| 4:20:14| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15614)|
| 4:20:16| I would just say to that, you know, I think that I see what you're saying with the extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15616)|
| 4:20:23| look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15623)|
| 4:20:23| I think that it also opens the door to restricting a need that some areas could have based off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15623)|
| 4:20:32| the opinions of the people who live near those and the preconceived notions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15632)|
| 4:20:38| Again, I, and I don't know, close my, I shouldn't have closed my computer, but I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15638)|
| 4:20:43| if this is considered a heavily intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15643)|
| 4:20:47| But I don't see how that, personally, I wouldn't compare that to something like a car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15647)|
| 4:20:55| or a car dealership or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| This is much closer to, I mean, architecturally, it's going to look a lot more like an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15657)|
| 4:21:02| or a healthcare facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15662)|
| 4:21:05| It's not, they don't use heavy machinery or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| So, you know, I think the big goal for us here is to try to expedite the abilities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15668)|
| 4:21:19| create more of these facilities, to create more opportunities for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15679)|
| 4:21:22| And I think that by restricting zones, we're just narrowing down the areas that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15682)|
| 4:21:29| serviced based off local opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15689)|
| 4:21:32| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15692)|
| 4:21:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15693)|
| 4:21:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| Yeah, I didn't, I think I missed Nathaniel's comment in my review of this about the appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15696)|
| 4:21:46| of different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15706)|
| 4:21:48| And one would think an office park would be one where there's all sorts of medical stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15708)|
| 4:21:58| going on just by nature of how the businesses are set up, what practices have been in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15718)|
| 4:22:05| and how the developers are building things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15725)|
| 4:22:08| I could envision a special use in those office park zones and the different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15728)|
| 4:22:18| We can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15738)|
| 4:22:19| If we need to postpone it 30 days and talk about it, generally, I'm happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15739)|
| 4:22:22| But, you know, I could see as long as it's on an office zone piece, if it's on an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15742)|
| 4:22:28| or a commercial road, I don't think that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15748)|
| 4:22:35| If we want to do a special use to make sure it's not abutting a residential zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15755)|
| 4:22:42| somebody may have a problem with, or it's not on a bus line, or, you know, I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| that these restrictions that these people are required to do couldn't cover all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15766)|
| 4:22:49| But I think he's brought up a good point, and I think that there's some merit in looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15769)|
| 4:23:00| into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15780)|
| 4:23:01| And I'd like to hear more from Director Brooks as to what we had before, and is there an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15781)|
| 4:23:08| opportunity to consider that, in your opinion, if it's a special use application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15788)|
| 4:23:19| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15799)|
| 4:23:20| In the previous zoning ordinance, they were allowed in 01 and 03, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15800)|
| 4:23:26| So they were allowed in the‚Ä¶| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15806)|
| 4:23:27| I think it's 02 or 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15807)|
| 4:23:29| I think I misspoke earlier, but yeah, I think it's 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15809)|
| 4:23:35| So, and they were allowed as a use on review now called special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15815)|
| 4:23:39| So I think that it would be appropriate, you know, to be honest, knowing that this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15819)|
| 4:23:43| be an issue that would generate discussion, taking baby steps to thinking about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15823)|
| 4:23:51| these could be expanded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15831)|
| 4:23:53| From a staff perspective, I don't think that we would have any objection if we were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15833)|
| 4:23:57| come back to you, which I don't think is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| I think that you all can do that today if you wanted to, if you wanted to say, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15839)|
| 4:24:03| to add this use as a special use in the O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15843)|
| 4:24:07| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15847)|
| 4:24:08| The reason I'm saying that is I don't want this to be a negative conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15848)|
| 4:24:14| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15854)|
| 4:24:14| This is a very serious conversation as we all agree, and Commissioner Minus agrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15854)|
| 4:24:21| and we're all just as passionate about making sure we're doing the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15861)|
| 4:24:30| We've got to vote this one up because we already have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15870)|
| 4:24:34| But I would hope that we would consider not approving this at this time and having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15874)|
| 4:24:39| discussion at a general review, let staff come back to us with some additional thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15879)|
| 4:24:44| and have some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15884)|
| 4:24:48| Didn't we speak also about amending the county ordinance to allow similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15888)|
| 4:24:54| I think what we said was that staff was going to approach the county and see what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15894)|
| 4:25:00| interest is based on what we were doing with the city, I think is where we left it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15900)|
| 4:25:04| I don't think that's something that we want to add without talking to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15904)|
| 4:25:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| At the agenda review, you had shared a map of the locations and it was like highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15913)|
| 4:25:18| in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15918)|
| 4:25:19| And if I'm not mistaken, we had a very small sliver in Bearden and mostly in the Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15919)|
| 4:25:25| Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15927)|
| 4:25:29| That is part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15929)|
| 4:25:32| Yes, I've asked our GIS staff to map locations where they would be currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15932)|
| 4:25:38| And a lot of those were institutionally zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15938)|
| 4:25:41| So you saw a lot of UT and other medical facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15941)|
| 4:25:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15945)|
| 4:25:45| So I just wanted to point out that those areas do have a lot of health care facilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15945)|
| 4:25:52| it's not logical to have another service available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15952)|
| 4:26:00| Yeah, you have lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15960)|
| 4:26:01| You have orthopedic doctors next to hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15961)|
| 4:26:03| You have plastic surgeons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15963)|
| 4:26:04| You have all these different types of ancillary supportive stuff around these medical facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15964)|
| 4:26:09| So Summit Health is all throughout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15969)|
| 4:26:10| And it's all zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15970)|
| 4:26:14| So it doesn't generate any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| It's just my note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15979)|
| 4:26:20| Yeah, I just want to echo what Commissioner Hill was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15980)|
| 4:26:24| I'd like to move forward on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15984)|
| 4:26:26| I don't want to delay it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15986)|
| 4:26:29| This is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15989)|
| 4:26:30| We can add office tonight or we can add it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15990)|
| 4:26:33| But I'd like to ask that we go ahead and vote on Amy's motion and that we move forward on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15993)|
| 4:26:39| getting something approved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| Asking a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16001)|
| 4:26:44| So we have a motion by Commissioner Midas, second by Commissioner Graf to approve drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16004)|
| 4:26:49| treatment facilities per staff's recommendation with the exception of making special use in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16009)|
| 4:26:56| the CG, General Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16016)|
| 4:26:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16018)|
| 4:26:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16019)|
| 4:27:00| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16020)|
| 4:27:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16022)|
| 4:27:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16024)|
| 4:27:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16024)|
| 4:27:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16026)|
| 4:27:07| I think those have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16027)|
| 4:27:08| So a motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16028)|
| 4:27:12| Commissioner Hill, do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16032)|
| 4:27:14| Yes, I would like to make a motion per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16034)|
| 4:27:18| In addition, I would like to propose that we add O1 and O3 as a special use provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16038)|
| 4:27:25| Is that where they were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| Yeah, that's the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16047)|
| 4:27:28| So you'd want to do O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16048)|
| 4:27:30| O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16050)|
| 4:27:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16051)|
| 4:27:32| O and OP as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16052)|
| 4:27:37| And if somebody has, you know, a real problem with the special use, I'm willing to drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16057)|
| 4:27:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16064)|
| 4:27:44| By special use, do you mean that it would have to come before a body and have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16064)|
| 4:27:49| before it's allowed to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16069)|
| 4:27:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16071)|
| 4:27:52| Okay, so everything else that we are approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16072)|
| 4:27:55| Permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16075)|
| 4:27:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16075)|
| 4:27:56| But why would you want to do a special use in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| I'm open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16079)|
| 4:28:00| I think Director Brooks and I kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16080)|
| 4:28:03| It would be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16083)|
| 4:28:04| We're just trying to be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| But, you know, there's nobody here to oppose this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16088)|
| 4:28:12| So let's recognize that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16092)|
| 4:28:14| We have no opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16094)|
| 4:28:16| It's been publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16096)|
| 4:28:19| If it's the will, I'm willing to put it out there as permitted use and O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16099)|
| 4:28:24| Why would you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16104)|
| 4:28:28| Because I'm just trying to get something passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16108)|
| 4:28:32| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16112)|
| 4:28:33| I mean, if there's a reason, I'd like somebody to tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16113)|
| 4:28:36| Maybe there is a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16116)|
| 4:28:38| Well, is it, do you, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16118)|
| 4:28:41| O and OP, is that more restrictive of a zone than CG?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16121)|
| 4:28:48| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16128)|
| 4:28:49| Wasn't it the residential component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| That office is sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16131)|
| 4:28:52| Yeah, some O abuts right up against residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16132)|
| 4:28:55| Whereas that's why we want to do the special use on O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16135)|
| 4:29:00| So that if it's in an arterial that doesn't abut residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16140)|
| 4:29:05| it would probably get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16145)|
| 4:29:06| But it's not going to be just slammed in right up next to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16146)|
| 4:29:09| There's also a lot of CG up against residential, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16149)|
| 4:29:15| So, I mean, it seems like you might as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| is office nestled against neighborhoods on the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16157)|
| 4:29:21| Sometimes, but as Commissioner Eddie Smith pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16161)|
| 4:29:24| the facility must have access to an arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16164)|
| 4:29:28| So if they were in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16168)|
| 4:29:32| you wouldn't be able to locate the facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16172)|
| 4:29:35| But medical clinics in general can go into those office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| Old ways of thinking are hard to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16181)|
| 4:29:44| And here we are thinking that these people are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16184)|
| 4:29:49| No, it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16189)|
| 4:29:50| It's a zoning question, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16190)|
| 4:29:51| And I'm guilty of it, because I'm trying to, I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| It's not that we're thinking they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16193)|
| 4:29:55| It's that it's a matter of where's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| what zone is appropriate for it, based on where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16197)|
| 4:30:01| So one illness versus another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16201)|
| 4:30:03| why is that any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| Okay, so why is a drive-thru a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16205)|
| 4:30:08| A drive-thru is an intensive exterior use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16208)|
| 4:30:11| It can change the character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| This is like an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16213)|
| 4:30:14| Car wash, same thing, exterior use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16214)|
| 4:30:16| This is an internal, it's like an office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16216)|
| 4:30:20| Nonetheless, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16220)|
| 4:30:24| So we're going to add O and OP if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16224)|
| 4:30:29| Special use or permitted use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16229)|
| 4:30:31| I'm going, I want an opinion from Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16231)|
| 4:30:36| I'll give you a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16236)|
| 4:30:38| So medical, dental, office, and clinics are allowed as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16238)|
| 4:30:41| in the office and office park districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16241)|
| 4:30:45| I'm going to say permitted use for the O and OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16245)|
| 4:30:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16249)|
| 4:30:50| Ms. Pershing, do you have any comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| Do you wish to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16252)|
| 4:30:54| I don't want to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16254)|
| 4:30:56| but you can see the commission's a little wavering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16256)|
| 4:31:01| I've been fighting this battle for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16261)|
| 4:31:04| And I can tell you, none of this conversation surprises me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16264)|
| 4:31:08| But at the same time, I'm happy to hear people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16268)|
| 4:31:14| why are we treating this differently than we do other conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16274)|
| 4:31:20| And so that gives me hope that we're moving in a new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16280)|
| 4:31:25| And I understand you all represent this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16285)|
| 4:31:29| and constituents and you're looking at that through their lens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16289)|
| 4:31:35| But again, I think leadership matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16295)|
| 4:31:39| And what we do as leaders in this community and how we talk about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16299)|
| 4:31:45| is going to help others understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16305)|
| 4:31:48| And so I think the more we can get behind what's going to heal our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16308)|
| 4:31:55| and that we can lead those of us in leadership positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16315)|
| 4:31:59| can lead with that message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| I think the more progress we're going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16321)|
| 4:32:03| and the more quickly we're going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16323)|
| 4:32:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16327)|
| 4:32:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16327)|
| 4:32:08| So we have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16328)|
| 4:32:10| seconded by Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16330)|
| 4:32:13| to approve amendments to the Knoxville City Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16333)|
| 4:32:16| Appendix B, Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16336)|
| 4:32:18| uses to add drug treatment clinics as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16338)|
| 4:32:22| in the CG, CH, CR, O, and OP zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16342)|
| 4:32:29| And to revise principal use standards for drug treatment clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16349)|
| 4:32:36| Oh, you still want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16356)|
| 4:32:37| I thought you were going to do permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16357)|
| 4:32:41| Permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16361)|
| 4:32:42| So you heard the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16362)|
| 4:32:44| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16364)|
| 4:32:46| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16366)|
| 4:32:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16368)|
| 4:32:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| Thank you, Ms. Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16373)|
| 4:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16374)|
| 4:32:56| I'd like to thank Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16376)|
| 4:32:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=16379)|
