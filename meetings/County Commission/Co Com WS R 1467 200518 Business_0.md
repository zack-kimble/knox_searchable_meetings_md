| 0:00:00| Thanks for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| Have a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1)|
| 0:00:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2)|
| 0:00:30| I'll go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| Good evening and welcome to the May meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| Tonight's meeting is the work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| I also want to make it clear that we are meeting in accordance with Governor Bill Lee's executive order 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| which was actually recently extended till the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| Hopefully we won't need it in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| But that executive order was extended till the end of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| which allows municipal bodies to meet electronically while we're trying to tamp down the COVID spread throughout the state and the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=60)|
| 0:01:10| So with that said, I'll go ahead and call the meeting to order and ask the county clerk to call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| After that, for those who may be tuning in from home, I'll kind of give a brief overview of how the meetings work and if this is your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| So, Madam Clerk, would you please call roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Commissioner Gill? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=88)|

| 0:01:33| Commissioner Smith? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| Commissioner Nystrom? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=95)|

| 0:01:41| Commissioner Bussler? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Commissioner Beeler? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Commissioner Daley? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Commissioner Jay? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Commissioner Biggs? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Okay, Commissioner Gill, would you mind leading us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=116)|
| 0:02:24| Let's try that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=144)|
| 0:02:37| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=157)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you. Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| For those of you who this may be your first meeting, just to give a really big picture, or excuse me, first time maybe watching a County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| this is something that we always say, even when we're not doing it via the Zoom medium, is every month the County Commission has two specific meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| The first meeting of the month is a work session where we take the first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| Many items will get initial debate or discussion or analysis during this work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| You'll also notice that some items we may vote on tonight, they could pass or be put on what's called a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| And the purpose of building a consent agenda is so that next week, on Tuesday at the main Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| many of those items that are on the consent agenda will be passed with one vote at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| So you don't have to have a roll call vote, frankly, on every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| So next week's meeting is the meeting that counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| All the votes are the ones that are the votes that count next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| This, as it said, this is a work session to do the first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| So now, another thing I might add at the beginning before I call on Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| you know, the way I've looked at these meetings and, you know, trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| take advantage of Zoom and the governor's order to make sure we're not all sitting next to each other or potentially passing any bugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| But, you know, should we get changed to move into phase two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| It's my plan to do my best to move us safely into in-person meetings upon moving into phase two on the county and the city's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| So, you know, with that said, we are now moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| And the so I mentioned in the forum, I've asked Mayor Jacobs to have a moment to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| So, Mayor Jacobs, you're you are you're officially called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As far as an update on COVID-19 since last meeting, the numbers are trending in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=300)|
| 0:05:09| I'd like to thank the Knox County Health Department for the great work that they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| both with testing as well as working with businesses to implement the phase one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| And also they continue to work with hospitals and health care providers and really be a hub, not only for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| but just overall in coordinating the response for COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| But again, we've been extremely fortunate. Our numbers are trending downward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| As of today, we have zero hospitalizations. The number we did see a slight increase in the number of cases last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| That was mainly due to a couple of worksite clusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| But now the cases have dropped pretty significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| And again, zero hospitalizations. And thankfully, we remained at five deaths for almost three weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| Every death, of course, is tragic, but we have fared much better than many other places has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| As we turn our attention to the other impacts of COVID-19, I do think it's important that we look at the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| We still have businesses now that have been allowed to open, but many of them only at half capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| Some still are not open. And of course, they all have some significant restrictions and been forced to deliver services in alternative ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=390)|
| 0:06:41| which is causing, as we can all imagine, disruptions not only to their businesses, but also to the people who work there and to the people they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=401)|
| 0:06:52| With that in mind, as you all know, last week, the governor announced that the state and the State Department of Health was moving a little faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=412)|
| 0:07:02| and ahead of schedule on meeting some of their restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| And I would like to read a letter that I wrote to the Joint Task Force for the city and the county in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=426)|
| 0:07:15| So the text of the letter reads, Dear Joint Task Force members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| As you know, last week, Governor Lee announced the state will issue new guidance, effective May 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| for large attractions such as theaters, theme parks, and museums, and will further ease restrictions on restaurants and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| I strongly urge you to follow the state's lead moving forward and support issuing similar guides for Knox County beginning Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| The purpose of COVID-19 mitigation efforts was to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| Thanks to the efforts of our community and our healthcare professionals, we have kept that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| Knox County has done what it's been asked of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| I understand the desire to exercise extreme caution before making changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| but available information indicates that it is safe to defer evolution restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| just as Governor Lee and the State Department of Health are doing in 89 other Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| Knox County is reporting some of the lowest pandemic numbers in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| and there is no certainty that staying closed as other counties in our region open will offer any protection from community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| As the virus runs its natural course, we must absolutely remain cautious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| but also realize that nothing we do is going to stop it out completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| The danger now is that we are unjustifiably delaying the process of healing our economy, which is itself a danger to public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| A sick economy will undoubtedly also produce sick people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Too many of our neighbors remain without work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| and too many businesses continue to struggle to keep their doors open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| even after implementing alternative business models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Delaying and easing these restrictions puts Knox County businesses at a competitive disadvantage to those in neighboring communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| harming not only the businesses themselves, but also the people they employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| How can we say our shutdowns can protect the health of our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| when we can't restrict their freedom to cross county lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and to patronize businesses which are not subject to the restrictions we have placed on our own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| When we look at Knox County's number of active cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| they indicate no good reason to continue enforcing this shutdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Toward this end, I believe that the Health Department's reopening task force should follow Governor Lee's lead rather than wait another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| Sincerely, Juan James Mount, County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| For specific information about COVID testing and the numbers that the Health Department is seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| I believe that Dr. Buchanan is on this call as well and should supply that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| And that is all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| All right. Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| Mr. Jay, can you hear me? You had your hand up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Can you hear me now? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| This is a question for either Dr. Buchanan or the mayor, whoever would like to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| But can you tell us when the task force's next plans to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And what was the current plan for reviewing the current phase that we're in and the next phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| making an announcement about the next phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| What was that? Where was that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| So this is Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I can I can take that. So I believe the task force meets tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| And our plan is to release some information later this week, probably on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| Probably not all the details, but some announcement about possibly about who who will be able to open in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=646)|
| 0:10:55| And so that's where we are with that. We are right now just really looking at the reviewing the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| reviewing the the guidance that's out there to allow businesses and other things to open safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| And, you know, looking at our numbers now, if they stay this way, certainly be able to move through the phases as we planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| And so that's where we are. But the task force meets tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| OK, thank you for that information. Just one follow up is the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Does the announcement from the governor or the does it come with any data or does it come with any suggestions for are they suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| Essentially skipping phase two and three altogether, or can you help decipher what the state is looking at versus how that I know where the state's different from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| But if you could sort of translate what they're heading towards versus what we have in place and what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| You know, I I honestly I'm not sure I can say what the difference is, not having a lot of detail about how they're making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=711)|
| 0:12:02| I know that they're putting out regular data and I know that the governor is looking at data from across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| I don't think they had any set time frame for their their phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| And I don't honestly I'm not even totally clear on how many phases they're planning on having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| I haven't found that in the reopening document or any other documents that I've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you, Dr. McKinnon. Mayor, just a quick follow up in your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Perhaps I didn't hear it, but I just curious, are you suggesting that we go sort of right to phase three or to eliminate phase two and three altogether and once I mean, help me understand that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=758)|
| 0:12:52| Currently, so currently, the state would be moving with restaurants and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| We're doing what they're doing on May 20th. They're doing that on May 22nd as well as opening to a large attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=780)|
| 0:13:10| So my suggestion is just to move the date that we're looking at up to the 22nd, as opposed to keeping restaurants where they're at now at half capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=790)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you for the clarification. Thank you, Mr. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you, Mr. J. Nexus, Commissioner Skinmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| This afternoon, the commissioner has got an email about three o'clock from one of the constituents in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| And the frustration level is is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| The governor is going to go ahead and allow restaurants to go to full 100 percent capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| But in our county where we're having wedding venues and people are trying to get married in June and July of this year, we're restricting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=832)|
| 0:14:02| And these are people that actually know each other. And yet they have a different set of guidelines just because it's a wedding venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| You can have a venue that holds a thousand people. But according to our rules, we can't we can't maintain we can't even get anywhere close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| And the problem is, you know, Loudoun County, Blount County, Anderson County, all the surrounding counties are not restricting it as much as we are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=860)|
| 0:14:30| So I'd like to know and the public would like to know from the health department, what kind of you know, are we going to just on phase two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| When are those things going to be announced and what's going on? Because people have got to make plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| If relatives are coming in for out of town for a wedding, they need to be able to secure airline flights and hotel reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| But we got to do something and we need we need somebody to come forward and explain exactly what's going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=892)|
| 0:15:03| Like I said, Mr. Schumacher up chair, if it's OK, may I take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| OK, OK. We'll be making an announcement on Thursday with some information about phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| And, you know, the distinction between a restaurant and an event venue is that the event venues are places you go to gather and socialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=919)|
| 0:15:31| Their restaurants are not places you go to gather and socialize. You go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| Well, some of you do when you're running for office, but usually you don't go around shaking hands and greeting everyone else at the other tables in the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=935)|
| 0:15:45| The restaurants need to maintain. We'll have to continue to maintain social distancing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| The limit to gathering gatherings continues to be 50, I believe, by the state guidance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| So, you know, there are some limitations on restaurants. They can there's no capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| There's no other. They have to maintain the six feet apart piece with their table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| So that will limit the number of people that can actually be in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So it's some of it gets down to what the intent of going to that place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| And the reason we've waited on some of those things is because of the risk, the behaviors that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| there are higher risk behaviors than behaviors that happen when you take out food or if you sit at a table with people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| limiting that to six people and you're not you're not going around greeting everyone in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| So that makes a difference. So we're looking at the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| We're looking at how COVID-19 is transmitted and using that information to inform the guidance that will be coming out soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| I anticipate the full guidance to be coming out early next week, if not sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| OK, and you're going to make some kind of an announcement on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah. You know, we have a regular daily press briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| That's what we've been using to make announcements. So we'll be using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| OK, well, I hope that you and the committee realize how frustrating this is for the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| particularly on these events like weddings and funerals and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| We're very sensitive to that. Absolutely. It's a challenging time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| All right. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Let's see. Commissioner Bussler, I was about to call on you because I know you'd proposed a discussion item earlier that was related to COVID and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| So I'm going to call you right now because your blue hand is up. But also, this might be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| We want to if you had some questions or we had some additional discussion related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| You're on. Please unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1073)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Butts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| There are some things about that we have to use for, you know, for being a little bit more human when we're doing this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1090)|
| 0:18:20| And what I mean by that is I've had a case here in some other cases that have risen where an elderly person has been at home and has fallen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| Their child comes by, which is also more, you know, not just a child, but say 30 or 40 year old child of this person that's 82 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1109)|
| 0:18:41| And they found their parent laying there or was in pain and they took him to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And the main thing that they did is they tested him right away for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| They tested negative and they went on in and found out that they had to do surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Now, the only person that they would let come into that hospital was the man's wife, who was 76 years old, which is in the high risk part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1135)|
| 0:19:04| The daughter wanted to come in, but they wouldn't let her come in by some guidelines that are done by the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| And humanity wise, it would have been better to let the daughter be there and the mother go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| But the thing of it is they put the husband in there, like I say, is an 82 year old guy that had some problems, like a little bit of dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1156)|
| 0:19:28| And he got mixed up, but his daughter wanted to go in and sit with her father, not her mother, because her mother is at a high risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1168)|
| 0:19:38| Now, we finally got that person in the hospital, the daughter, in there to sit with the father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| But it was like pulling teeth to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| We've got to have some kind of rules when somebody does not have COVID that gets injured that their family can be with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1189)|
| 0:19:58| And also, when you mention funerals like that, too, when you have a funeral and you want to pay respects to that individual and you're a family member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| you should be a little less restrictive on that type of visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| And I know this is a highly contagious disease we're dealing with, but we've got to have some humanity somewhere to take care of some of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1212)|
| 0:20:22| especially the elderly ones that are being affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| And later on, I want to talk about the opening up of religious gatherings, too, and how we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| because we have a wide range of ages in a religious church where you have from the very young to the very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| And how can we do that and make sure that we can get together and worship together like we're guaranteed by our Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| And we've got to have some sort of common sense in how we do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| And I just wonder how we're going to address those issues also. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| Dr. Buchanan, if you want to take on Commissioner Bussler's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| I guess, Commissioner Bussler, can you tell me what your questions are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| The question is, if an elderly person comes in that has fallen and has a hip problem like this 82-year-old gentleman had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| this is a true issue that's happened, he was immediately separated and tested for the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| They would not let the wife go back with him on back into the hospital, even though she said that she wanted to be tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| But she was 76 years of age, too, so she's highly susceptible to this and at the high risk end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| So the daughter wanted to substitute to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And the rules at the hospital said that they wouldn't let the daughter go in in place of the mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| So the guidance that the hospital is using is developed by the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Those are all developed by the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| But it's not when you're separating people from other people to try to give that care, that's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| And I don't know how we're going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We've got to have some sort of means to say these people shouldn't be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Well, my suggestion to you is I don't know which facility it was, but I would reach out to their administrative folks who are making those decisions and voice your concerns to them as they're the ones who are making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1342)|
| 0:22:37| We don't have any oversight of that and how that gets enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Sometimes depends on the person who's on duty at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| The restrictions on visitation are really about protecting people in the hospital from somebody who might have COVID coming in and introducing it to them because they are higher risk because they're already in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:58| So I would suggest that you have your friend or you reach out to the hospital administrator at that particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1378)|
| 0:23:08| Your voice is going to be more meaningful to them than mine about this issue when it comes to citizens and customers not being happy with the service that they're providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1388)|
| 0:23:19| Those are in place for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Well, I understand the reason being is, and there's also even in this one facility that I was talking about, there was almost a floor of bedrooms that are not being used because they're opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1402)|
| 0:23:35| They have a lot of beds opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Surely the hospitals can put one section for COVID and another section for, you know, what we call regular patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| Certainly that's called cohorting and sometimes they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| However, people also have COVID and have a heart attack or people also have COVID and have a fractured hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| So that doesn't always work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| So they follow the standard procedures for isolation and protecting patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| And somebody could go into the hospital and not have COVID and be incubating and get sick while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| So it's not as easy as just putting them here and putting them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And I guess, and so what was your other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| There was something about churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Churches are being, the plans for churches are being written by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| The governor has explicitly said that local health departments do not have the authority to write any rules or make any recommendations related to places of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| So that guidance is coming from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| We don't have any ability to change that or alter that at the county level regarding places of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1482)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| What I had on the first part about the elderly gentlemen and separating them from their families is that they're immediately tested when they go in, whether they have the virus or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1493)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| The family member said, I would like to be tested so I can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And they said, that's not the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| The first person that they could go in there was like the wife, which is elderly also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| And again, I really, you're going to get a lot more traction going to that hospital administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| I did go to the administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| And they said the rules were here and this is what the rules were set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| But anyway, I got them in there in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Some other people in there, but there's people out there that go through this frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| And we've got to work with them some way of have some humanity in our reactions to these people that are not going to the hospital, other than for the COVID virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1540)|
| 0:25:53| And I don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I don't know what the rules and regulations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| And I know everybody's worried about getting sued now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| And there's got to be something that we could start here that we can protect these people that need that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| But anyway, I'll just let it end at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| And I'll try to take care of it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| This question is for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Have we begun to look at how to address the school systems and the plan to roll out for the coming term in August or September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1583)|
| 0:26:37| It's a great question for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I think they're probably on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I don't know where they are in their planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| And so that's a great question for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| So if someone from schools wants to respond to that, thank you for the question, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| This is Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| We've got several of our staff members here and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| We are looking at several different options right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Of course, the hope is that we open up and we go to school like we've always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| However, we know that may not be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| So, of course, on your agenda today is we're looking at purchasing technology, putting a laptop or device in each of our children's hands so that we can move towards online instruction if it's a situation where we can't go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1632)|
| 0:27:30| So we're looking at several different scenarios, whether or not we can come back for like an A-B day, for example, like where kids might come on a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1650)|
| 0:27:40| Wednesday and every other Friday and then Tuesday, Thursday, every Friday would be a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| We haven't gotten a whole lot of direction yet from the State Department because I guess we're trying to close out this year, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| But we are making plans and looking at different scenarios for opening up in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| So I don't know if you have further questions about that or not, but we were trying to take everything into consideration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1679)|
| 0:28:10| I have one follow up question, which probably has some clarification from the law director, because if we return to school, does the county bears the liability if people contract COVID-19 or what is our procedural standpoint regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1690)|
| 0:28:28| And I know this is uncharted territory, but I just I think I'm not sure if we have actually asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| I just simply like to begin the discussion centered around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you, Mr. Law Director, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| OK, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Yes. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Well, right now we are currently under a suit related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| And I'm sure there will be plenty more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Being sued is one thing and being liable is something that the courts will have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| As long as we follow the policy of the state, we have a great chance for immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| It's when we follow our discretion that we run into liability problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you, Mr. Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Is that going to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| OK, thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I just wanted to play off of what Commissioner Bustle was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| He was talking about the hospitals and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Today, Covenant Health released a visitation policy, and hopefully it's a thing that we're going to see trending in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| It states that inpatients may have two designated visitors doing their time of stay, one visitor at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| All visitors are going to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| And they want people to bring a mask to wear at their destination, which is the hospital, whenever they get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| And they want them to limit their travel inside the hospital to the cafeteria and vending machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| So hopefully, Commissioner Bustler, I understand your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| But if Covenant Health is coming out with something like that, then maybe we're going to see the other hospitals in our area do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Glad you're on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Are you good, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I was trying to figure out how to lower my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| I have a question for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| But first, I want a clarification from the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| When he said we're currently involved in one COVID suit, is that a suit where somebody's suing us because they contracted COVID-19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| Or is it a suit by a business owner for not being able to be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| It's a class action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| It's a class action suit with restrictions that they perceive the county has put upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I think Commissioner Gill was worried more about the liability of kids going back and contracting the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| And I think you did answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| As long as we're following state guidelines, we have a certain amount of immunity from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| But from what I understand, we have our own guidelines because we have our own health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| Dr. Buchanan, I have a question for you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| We have done – we've been at half capacity in restaurants for – it's almost two weeks now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| We're starting our third week, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| And I know that we have went to – our testing has really ramped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| I know Evelyn Gill's been a big participant in that, and there's a lot of places that we've done a lot of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| Have most of these tests that we've done, we've got results, have we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| And there has not been a significant uptick in the number of cases, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| There hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Okay, but all these testing – I keep hearing 400 or 500 here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| What is our turn time now on testing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| I believe it's about 2.6 days or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| I mean, it's two to three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| So if we were to have a surge, we are in much better shape now to detect it earlier than we were, say, a month, two months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:50| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Commissioner Karen Dressel, your regular hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Yeah, this is just a little bit on what Commissioner Bessler and Commissioner Biggs was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| And just to reemphasize that what Dr. Buchanan was telling from our health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1989)|
| 0:33:18| the hospitals had their own, I guess, say, task force that all got together when all this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and they all made the rules that all of them would abide by the same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| And up until last week, no one was allowed, not even husband or wife or no one was allowed to be in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| because the way with this Corona virus is that you have to assume that everybody is contagious right now because of people testing positive for it and not having any symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2021)|
| 0:33:57| like Perry Pratt, who owns Pratt's Country Store in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| His wife, Kelly, was very sick and has been very sick and is still sick, but getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| Perry never had any symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| So, you know, who's to say he may have given it to her instead of her giving it to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| That's the strange thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| When you have the flu, you get tested for the flu, you usually know you've got some kind of symptom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| But we've got people that have this COVID-19 and there's no symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| So just like last Thursday, I think the hospital started allowing one visitor because we've had several friends and all whose parents have been in and didn't get to have a visit from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2070)|
| 0:34:46| And a gentleman who fell, was paralyzed, out of state, and his family was not ever, I mean, not able to even visit him for over a month until just this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2086)|
| 0:34:59| So, and Justin is right, it's not just Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And I'm pretty sure whoever you were talking about probably did not come to University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| But I do know that they've all opened that up and they are going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| But that doesn't mean that one can come in for 30 minutes and another visitor come in for 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| It's been very tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| And these hospitals do for UT had two floors just for COVID patients where they weren't mixing the patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| So anyway, it's something that nobody was prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| It's been very serious and everybody's learned a lot from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| And I'm praying that we don't have another wave come through this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| But I'm pretty sure that everybody has learned on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| And hopefully Knox County, our state, and the whole U.S. will be better prepared if something like that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| So thank you, Dr. Buchanan, and all of your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| And thank you to all the hospitals trying to keep everybody just safe as they can, even though it was tough for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| Because trust me, they love to have a visitor to be there with their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Nurses and all can't be in their rooms all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So it's just been a very tough trying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And we understand and I want you to know the hospital administrations and the physicians and nurses understand how hard it's been on the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| Because it's been very hard on them with family members not being able to be there to comfort their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:44| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Commissioner Smith, your light is still on, but I've got a quick question for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| I'll try to be really brief and really pragmatic on this question, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| As we start to transition to opening things up just a little bit more, are you aware of any of our local businesses or local single site employers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2216)|
| 0:37:06| And many of them I know that, you know, through your team, there's a lot of public options that people have been taking advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| And I recently saw a story about how Tennessee is actually in some ways leading the country in terms of providing free tests to people who want it, need it, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| But are you seeing any use of, say, the private labs and employers kind of hiring people just to do, you know, on site screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| Is that a trend that we're starting to see? And are you aware of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| And also, if larger employers wanted to do that, are they reaching out to the chamber who might have a network of providers on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| I guess for the larger single site employers that might have, say, more than 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| I'm just curious kind of what you're what you're hearing or what you're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| To be completely honest, my staff probably knows more about that than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| You know, we I am aware that employers are considering testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Larger employers can certainly do that on their own. And, you know, we what I've generally done, if if an employer reaches out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2282)|
| 0:38:11| I've tried to connect them with a lab that I'm aware of or even maybe a provider who might be willing to partner with them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| You know, and so the other thing that employers certainly could do is if they have a health provider for their for their employees, they could do that testing for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2299)|
| 0:38:30| So there's lots of options for those for profit folks. You know, our goal is really to test the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| And I know those employees live in the community, but I'm hoping that some of the employers will step up and do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| OK, interesting. I'll reach out. I'm not seeing any other hands raised on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| And I know we've put this, as I said, in the commissioner's form that I wanted to keep for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| All of our things related to the pandemic at the top of each each agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| Are there any other questions or comments yet? Go ahead, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Chairman. Yes, this was for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I realize, I mean, now that there is the antibody tests that people can be tested for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| Would you let the rest of the commission and maybe anybody that's listening know exactly about that and where they might can be tested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| Because the good thing about this one is, is that if you have had COVID-19, you can go and be tested and they can actually take your plasma to help maybe help someone else who comes down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2367)|
| 0:39:45| So I just wondered if you might could give us an update on anything about that that you might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| So, yeah, so you're talking kind of about two different things. Yes, there are folks locally who are looking at convalescent plasma and using that to help protect folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2392)|
| 0:40:07| That's very experimental and very early. So those studies are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| And then there are the antibody tests that are available at some providers. Antibody tests for COVID-19 are not yet ready for diagnostic purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2413)|
| 0:40:23| They're being used by the CDC for what they would call community surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| So that's looking across the community to assess disease burden and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| They're not they're not for your doctor to tell you if you had it or didn't have it or give you any guidance on your immunity because we're not quite sure how long the immunity to COVID-19 last once you get over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2434)|
| 0:40:47| So the antibody tests have to be interpreted with with a skeptical eye and really aren't used to for diagnostic purposes yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2447)|
| 0:40:59| They may get to the point where they're useful for diagnosis, but they can miss a positive because it takes time to produce the antibodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| So then you get a false a false negative and you really have the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| And again, really can't tell you much about immunity. They mostly can tell you you've been exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| If it's positive, you've been exposed. When you had the disease, nobody knows whether you have immunity and how long that lasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| We don't have that information either. So they're of limited use at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Hopefully they'll become more useful as time goes on. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| OK, thank you. Seeing no other questions, we're going to go ahead and move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. Thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for addressing commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| We're now at the part of the agenda where excuse me. Yes. Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| I'm just wondering if we need to vote to accept the governor's order to hold our meeting this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| I'll look to the law director. Mr. Law Director, do we need to vote to accept a meeting in this mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| I'm not I can't recall if we've done that at every meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2526)|
| 0:42:17| Mr. Law Director, if you're talking, there's a I didn't hear your question, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| OK, my question was actually relaying the question from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Mr. Smith had asked if for your opinion, if we needed to vote to conduct the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| the the mechanism provided by the governor's executive order 16, which was extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| You need to vote to conduct the meeting electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| No, he gives you that option and the chairman has the option of conducting a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:56| I'll move on from that then, because I'm not sure that I think you have the discretion under your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| You call the meetings and under the state's rule to us, we can go one of two formats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| And he didn't give the legislative body any guidance as to whether they vote on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| OK. OK. All right. Thank you. We'll we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Mr. Smith, I think I've been in meetings that have gone both ways, and I don't think we've actually looking back at our commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| I don't recall if we've actually voted to conduct the meeting the last two months electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| I think we've just kind of charged on and acknowledged at the beginning of the meeting, the governor's executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| So with that said, we're now at the point on our agenda where we actually need to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| So if you've got a pen handy, I'm going to go over the the ads, withdraw, deferrals and the non consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| If there's one that I missed, please just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Or if there's one that has not even come up that you'd like to have pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| There are three specific ones that we need to add. And that's item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| Our agenda item 51, 53. And then there's one that we don't have a number for yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| And that was resolution R-205-909, which was to accept the hand sanitizer from Katom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:24| So that one that is lacking a number since it was a it just got to us upon it being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| We will place that one on the consent agenda. Item number 41 was a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| Moving down into the deferrals, we've got item 54, which was to be deferred to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| I believe that was Mr. Buehler's item on littering. Then item 10, item 58 and item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2688)|
| 0:44:59| Those were our deferrals. And I'll look out, see if we've got any additional deferrals before I move into the non consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| Commissioner Smith, your hand is our Mr. Schoonmaker. Yes, I have a question about number 41, the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| It was my recollection that this item was going to be deferred because Commissioner Anders had requested that this item be deferred until we can meet face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2716)|
| 0:45:31| So did the rules committee meet and decide to withdraw this from the agenda or how did we get to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| All right. Thank you. I'm going to move that. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In order for it to be changed because it was set in such a way would have to go back to the rules committee, because it was a matter of what order were things in and so instead of we haven't conducted the rules committee and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2743)|
| 0:45:56| have one of the books right now because of the limited meeting so it's excellent to come back to the suggested changes I think from Commissioner Smith, you would have to go back to the rules committee and then come back up so I just asked for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2756)|
| 0:46:10| withdrawn until we could reconvene the rules committee and bring it back in proper order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Okay, so we Commissioner Smith made some changes to that is what you're saying, I suggested, no he suggested that be changed in a particular order but in order to sense it was already in form and in agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2775)|
| 0:46:29| In order to do that I couldn't just make that change I'd had to go back to the rules committee, make the change get it approved and send it back up per the law department so we have not had that meeting and so there's no reason to keep it on here right now, so I just asked for it to be withdrawn until we can meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2789)|
| 0:46:48| Okay, okay, because because I thought we had it in format and it was just that we wanted to meet in person. So the public could give us their thoughts directly I think that was also a concern from Commissioner Anders, that he suggested that we wait until we can meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2808)|
| 0:47:04| And I talked to the law department about keeping it on essentially until we get it in the right format, which has to come out of the rules committee, we can't have we can't have a discussion about it anyway so it's a little bit of the parliamentary spaghetti junction but in order to properly we're going to have to reconvene the rules committee, get it back out of proper form so it likely will come to you all and, you know, maybe July or August and then by that point hopefully we're all in the same room and we can have a bigger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2824)|
| 0:47:33| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| All right. Thank you. And, uh, Mr Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| You're shaking your head. All right, you're gone. All right, Mr skin maker. Yeah, if you could take turn off your, your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| All right. Very good. So, that was the withdrawal, which we've clarified, thank you for the question on that john I'm going to go back and review what I've just said the deferrals item 54 item 10 item 58 and item 30 were all deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2872)|

| 0:48:41| Were there any adult. Okay, I like Mr J. You said 58 which you just said was deferred, so that would not be a non consent, you're correct. All right, so we'll move that on, let me make sure that down right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2921)|
| 0:49:01| Yeah, I think I wrote that one just down in the wrong piece of paper there. Yeah, that one is a deferral that was the, that's his only item for Mr Monday he wants to do that one, face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2941)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you, but they're also something on the forum about item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| Item six is going to be on consent but Amanda roadcliff is going to be the person he'll be appointed to the library board. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Chairman you also had 55 not on consent. That was Commissioner Bessler is discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| Yeah, I'll, we have pulled that from consent but I'm going to look to Commissioner Buster I think Mr Buster we sort of move that one up to the top of the agenda so that we can cover that at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:47| Is that the way I understand it looked like we discussed that pretty efficiently at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| Yeah, that was what was mentioned that's why I've mentioned it before so you can take care of it. Yeah, exactly. Okay, thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| Okay, Mr skin maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you, Mr Chairman, I'd like to pull agenda item number 38, and this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| Chris Caldwell could give us a opportunity to update us on this procedure policy. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3012)|
| 0:50:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3021)|

| 0:50:45| I've got another thing we were just at the point where we have got our agenda for the meeting set tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| I'll take you back last month to last month's meeting if y'all recall, we knew that these meetings are going to take a lot longer because of the process of doing all of the roll call votes, you know, and all that piece we do every meeting would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3052)|
| 0:51:05| last a whole lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| So in our last month's meeting, we decided that in order to do the public hearing case members of the public didn't want to wait until late at night to be more efficient, that we would have that public hearing briefly during a intermission of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3067)|
| 0:51:21| commission meeting at six o'clock tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3081)|

| 0:51:43| I'm not aware if anybody's expressed any interest in weighing in on that particular item, but I would like to make sure we get the hearing done, see if there's any interest that I'm going to ask Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3103)|

| 0:52:00| I think this is a meeting that this hearing we can kind of do right now while we're in this I don't know if I ought to check I don't think that was that if that was a separate zoom or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3120)|
| 0:52:09| We'll close out this zoom and then have to come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3129)|

| 0:52:39| Okay, so we really we have had no no one expressed an interest in weighing in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Hey, Zach if you're there, just from an operational perspective. I have been so busy staring at this agenda, did we set that up that hearing up as a separate zoom or is that to be conducted as part of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3163)|
| 0:52:54| It's correct it's a separate meeting, it would be like you'd like Drew said it was set at the conclusion or six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| Okay, well let's do this then we'll have that at the end of this meeting, because operationally I can't imagine having to close this this zoom account out and then go back into it so there's anybody in the public who wants to weigh in on that pop parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3181)|

| 0:57:04| I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| That parents could buy insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| I'm wondering who's going to be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Lost or damaged equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And are we going to be sending these things home with kids to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Have to bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| The next day, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| We have an inventory in case they forget to bring it back the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| I'm kind of worried about the maintenance cost of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Commissioner. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| It's probably going to be end up being a principal decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| school decision in terms of take home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| And bring back the dollars that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| we're looking at in terms of repairs will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Help us to make the repairs. We'll make those internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| Of course, if the laptop is destroyed, then the parent would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Responsible for the cost of that. If it's a situation where it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| it's destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| So we, we probably, but if a child forgets to bring their laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| I know we'll, the school will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Potentially would have maybe a loaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| That I guess we could make for the child. So this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| this is a work in progress for us. So, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| but we've done some one-to-one deployment over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| And, and actually it's worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| I know this is on a much larger scale than what we've done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| but we had, we've had several schools on one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| Deployment. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| It's going to be, like I say, a work in progress, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| In terms of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Economic club people who would have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| some would have the ability if their student wants to drop one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| in a puddle or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| And we have others that wouldn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| we looked at a system wide insurance policy on this equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| We have, have not, I don't believe we've got several staff members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| So if I speak incorrectly, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I'm going to ask one of our other folks to jump in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| but we have not looked at a system wide insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3572)|
| 0:59:50| Madam vice chair. Do you want to take over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Yeah, that's what I was looking. It looks to me like it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| His is frozen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| Yes, vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you. Okay. It looks like we go to commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you, madam vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| My question was regarding the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Associated with the computers for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| And I know we're getting monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| From the cares act to cover the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| But this becomes a reoccurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| After the initial purchase of this, after the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| How do we anticipate covering the cost of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| In the following or preceding years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you. Thank you, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| The initial funding for this will be through the cares act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| We expect to receive somewhere between 12.8, 12.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| A million dollars. So we would utilize seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| $7 million for the purchase and support the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| In terms of years, subsequent years after that, that will have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| It will be a recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| To the general purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| I just don't think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| We can afford to go online instruction based on what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| The spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| We were in a situation where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Our students could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| It's breaking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I can't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| Let me try it again. Is that any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And let me just start back where we are slated to receive about 12.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| 9 million dollars through the cares act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| We would utilize about $7 million of that to enter into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| This lease agreement. You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| That it would be a recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Once this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| We utilize this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| It would, it would be up to the general purpose budget to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Define this on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| So we would have to build that into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| And there are budget each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| In order to find it, but I think it's something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I think it's something we have to do because of the situation we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| ourselves in the spring where we were not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Introduce new learning to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| And if it's a situation where we're not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Being able to provide that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Instruction for students. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| So to answer your question, it will be a reoccurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| In our general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| After this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| And I don't know, Mr. McPherson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| If I can shed a little bit more light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| And so Mr. Thomas is correct. I would, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| In, in many ways, locking it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| 10, 11, 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| During the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| We received federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| It was part of what they call era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| American recovery relief act, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And so those dollars were essentially used to buy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| We, at that time, we're able to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| We were able to save the financial support for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| They were able to get into their teaching positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| two years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| As the economy slowly bounced back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Once that happened in the sustainable structure of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3798)|

| 1:04:28| to it, yet we're moving to an online format. That the, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| there seems to be some disconnect in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| No, no, I think that's, I think that's a fair question. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| that's that, that we have to have to consider. And okay, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| we have Russ Oaks here, our Chief Operating Officer, who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| can shed a little bit of light on where we are in that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3893)|

| 1:05:05| ability to provide remote instruction. But we do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| there's a digital divide and that there is an access issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| in parts of our county either, because the service is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| provided or the service is too expensive for some folks. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| we're working with a couple of organizations around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| to identify solutions to that, and how to expand broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| access across our county and Wi Fi access as well. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| know, we anticipate being able to find some ways to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| that over the coming weeks. And just so you're aware, the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| internet service providers are involved in those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3951)|

| 1:05:59| the solution as we work our way through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Thank you. And my final question is, do do we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| stakeholders committee meeting of parents and teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| families throughout the county to look at some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| coming for the school system in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| We have talked about forming that we've been doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| mostly internally at this point. However, I'm aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| Governor Haslam has a task force looking at ways the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| can can help the school system with reopening. So we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| meeting there, but also we're looking at possibly involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| some other stakeholders in this process as we work through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| here in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| And can we get that information of who's on those committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| because I serve a district that has a large percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| students that have broadband challenges, as well as families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4019)|

| 1:07:11| closure in the community in which I serve. So I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| make sure we have people on these committees making those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4034)|

| 1:09:16| I can tell you that this is Russ. Some of those issues we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4156)|

| 1:09:24| anticipate or certainly our goal is to have Chromebooks on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4164)|

| 1:10:28| additional personnel to provide technical support for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4228)|

| 1:10:56| time. The good thing for us about these Chromebooks is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4256)|

| 1:11:12| those. And then your question on the the help desk is one that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| still have to resolve internally and how we're going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| that. Yeah, well, I mean, because I won't be voting to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4283)|

| 1:12:26| decision has to be made on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| Okay. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I still haven't heard the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| of what are the costs beyond the initial purchases annually that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| you estimate? That's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Yes, Commissioner. This is Ron. So this would be a three year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| lease. It's a three it's a $15 million three year lease. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| $5 million and an annual lease payment with roughly $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| in support. So it's a $7 million investment for the first three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| years. These devices have an expected life of five years. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| you know, beyond that, obviously, in years four and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| five, we believe, you know, that would presumably be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| considerable amount of budgetary savings, what we would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| do though would be, and it's still a long ways off. But what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| we would probably do at that point would be to come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| funding strategy such that we could recognize budgetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| savings, but we could begin to kind of smooth those payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| out such that when the devices are in use, we can start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| when the devices would be replaced, we would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| have an available revenue stream already programmed into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| budget, but likely less than than the $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| Okay, you also mentioned that you're expected to receive or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| the superintendent expected to receive $12.8 million in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| CARES Act. This proposal is for $7 million. Can you help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| understand where the other $5.8 million will go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Yes, Commissioner. So there's going to have to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| dollars that we'll fund private that we'll have to allocate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| private schools in the charter. We're still trying to narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| that down. Our estimate at this point is about a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| dollars that can go one a little bit one way or the other. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| that gives us a net of about 11.8. With the $7 million with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| CARES, then then that gets us to a net of about 4.8 at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| point. What what we are, the strategy that we're seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| looking at at this point is potentially using those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| to essentially fund some of the 2020 obligations that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| incurring now to help cover the likely shortage in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| revenue. The reason we feel we need to do that is, is we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| probably going to be in a position for the upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| budget to have to replenish some dollars that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| utilize in fund balance in order to meet that 3% state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| requirement. So if we can use those dollars to essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| retroactively fund what sales tax shortages could not fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| that puts us in a stronger position as we enter the 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| budget. It puts less of a strain on it because the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| that we would have to make up through replenishing fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| balance would be significantly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| And does the CARES Act allow you to use funding one time funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| like this for fund balance replenishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Well, we wouldn't certainly we wouldn't label it as fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| balance replenishment. What we would what we would label it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| would be funding existing initiatives, like existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| expenditures. So it would in effect replenish fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| But otherwise, if we don't use it for existing obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| then that will be an amount that we would have to reduce out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| the FY 21 budget and replenish it that way. So it's it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| essentially as broad as it is long in in that would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| effect of it, if we could go back and retroactively apply it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| towards 2020 obligations, and we believe we can do that. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| conversations with the state, you know, with that. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| know, it's much like the ARRA dollars, you know, we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| what that the ARRA dollars allowed us not to have to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| into the budget back 10-12 years ago. And so, you know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| would be the most, in our opinion, would be the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| strategic way to do that rather than to simply find an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| additional $4 million worth of initiatives with one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| dollars. I mean, we don't, I just don't think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| a, you know, a strong financial position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Just to be final question, just to be clear, it was stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| you don't expect to need any additional headcount, funding or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| IT support to to go beyond the initial purchase, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4630)|

| 1:17:17| that correct for the next three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| That's certainly the plan for the upcoming year. Russ is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| here. We didn't say we didn't need any. We said at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| in time, we're going to try to work with what we've got, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| our fiscal constraints in the in the current year, and also given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4654)|

| 1:18:24| Um, Commissioner Daly hasn't went and I've already went this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4704)|

| 1:18:38| go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4718)|

| 1:18:49| this is for Ron. I've had a couple of people ask me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| lease. And I told them that this is not a police like we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4733)|

| 1:19:02| years or three years. Am I correct? And are we using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| term lease instead of purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| It is a it is a lease purchase. So they will be ours. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| it's technically a lease. But after that three year term, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| are our devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Daly. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| guessing maybe by leasing them, does that allow you to expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| them rather than put them in the capital? I'm guessing so? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| All right. Very good. Okay. Next, we've got Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4771)|

| 1:19:58| Well, that would not allow us that the funding would be would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4798)|

| 1:20:12| just, you know, it's not sufficient to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| that. What it does allow us to do is to do phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| Okay. And was this put out to bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| We have a state we have a state contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4834)|

| 1:20:40| Yeah, Mr. Oaks. So two things. Does all of our schools have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| broadband capacity? Or is there going to be any upgrading needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| at the schools for Wi Fi spots? And two, are we going to convert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| if this works, which I hope it does, I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| Are we going to convert to digital textbooks and save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4858)|

| 1:21:04| updates electronically instead of purchasing new books and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4864)|

| 1:21:13| As you may recall, we started building out our wireless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| infrastructure seven or eight years ago. And we've we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| largely finished that process. We've got 11 square feet under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4880)|

| 1:21:52| we'll have to do a little bit of work with. But we do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| very robust, robust Wi Fi and broadband system. With the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| discussion of textbooks, that's probably something that's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| in Dr. Roswick's area. But I will say that we have found over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| time that there is not a great reduction in cost or operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:21| use between textbooks and computers because of the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| textbook companies structure their financial models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Well, I think this is I mean, this this is driving difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| and pivoting everything. Every every economy, every market is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| going to pivot and have to do that. But if you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| electronic, you can update it quicker. It may cost the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| but you get a more current and a more up to date teaching. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| if if textbook companies don't pivot, they're gonna get left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| behind on the economy, the new market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Yep. And that's, that's true. And and with many, if not most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| of our textbooks, when we purchase those, we get a digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| companion that goes with that. But like I say, it doesn't save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| us any money in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| Okay, Commissioner Anders, any follow up on that? All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| thank you. We'll go back. I've got back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| Famous chair. Superintendent Thomas, it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| that this is phase one, I'm assuming that phase two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| phase three are just the next two years of the lease purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| program. Okay, it's also my understanding that the cares act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| is intended not to replace revenue streams, lost revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5019)|

| 1:23:54| all have checked with to make sure that this is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5034)|

| 1:24:02| the lack of being able to educate children in a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| like this and to get us prepared for it in the future. Have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| considered what were you going to use the other 5 million for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Have you considered just doubling up on the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| We did think about doing that initially, but I'll let Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| finish what I'm about to say. But again, we're finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| ourselves in a real dilemma from a budget standpoint with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| projected revenues that are coming in for this year, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| as trying to prepare a budget for next year. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| shortfall that we're going to be facing, you know, initially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| March, early March, we were looking at possibly a $20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| million increase in revenues. Actually, what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| right now is probably spending a budget that's going to be next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| year's budget less than this year's budget. So we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| finding ourselves in a real dilemma. And we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| make sure that we, from the standpoint of our classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| teachers, making sure that we that we're trying to minimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| the impact to our classrooms as much as we possibly can with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| facing the budget shortfalls that we're looking at. So I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| let Ron jump in. And if I missed answering any of that, let him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| pick me pick up in pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| No, but yeah, Superintendent Thomas is correct. We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| consider parking some of that money to fund a portion of year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| two. The problem that once again, that we are faced with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| is a considerable strain on the upcoming budget. Because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Ron, you're coming in scratchy. I don't know if you're too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| from the mic or got two mics on but you can see better. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Okay. Yes, we did consider parking some of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| remaining dollars in year two that puts us in fiscal year FY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5159)|

| 1:26:08| million dollars missing in bank while we're cutting this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| upcoming budget another four or five million dollars. So yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| and the other question I think was with regards to acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| uses of those CARES Act funds. Additional information that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| coming out from the feds was that you can't you cannot use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| these dollars to replenish shortages of revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| There is a host of items now that have come from the feds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| the state on acceptable uses of these dollars. The long and short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| of it is in and we have been in communication with the state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| we have the states. We have this in writing actually, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| cannot dictate to us to use those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| I couldn't hear. Yeah. Yeah. Once again, you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| scratchy again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Not really. Okay. Is this any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| For now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Okay. Not really sure what's going on. Where did where did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| you where did where did I leave off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Yes, you had had communication from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Okay, the state, this is the long and short of it. The state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| cannot, and this is according to the state, cannot dictate or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| limit an AEA's use of those funds. I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| information originally coming out, you know, is that revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| you can't use this to replenish revenue shortages. The decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| here is that you can still attack revenue shortages by how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| you spend the dollars. And the state cannot restrict AEA's from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| how to spend those dollars. They do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| let's try to wrap it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| You're breaking up, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| The long and short of it is, is the state cannot tell AEA's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| to use those dollars. We have broad discretion in how we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Okay, good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Final question, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5293)|

| 1:32:09| that it's a very tangible number, and as you look to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| of the various booster clubs, local level foundations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5532)|

| 1:32:19| the Knoxville Education Foundation could look in finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| sources of funds because it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5543)|

| 1:32:29| schools to raise the 7 million, but part of me wonders if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| may be some room for some philanthropy because it's a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| easier bite when you look at it, $30 per machine versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=5558)|

| 1:40:18| It's a proven extension, one, to divine services contract among Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| and Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| for services related to the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| I'd like to get a motion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| The chair sees Commissioner Smith's hand raised first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| Yes, I'll make a motion to get the topic on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6039)|

| 1:40:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| All right, the motion on the floor is to send forward with no recommendation the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| I think it's next Tuesday's meeting by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| All right, that motion's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| I just, we're in a time right now where we are looking at a lot of funding issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| and we're looking to enter a contract that's about $2.4 million over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| This program has changed a lot since it originated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| There's no more state funding for operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| It went from a 72-hour program to a 24-hour program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Between the county and the city, there's about $1.4 million spent annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| They're averaging about 520 patients a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| That's an average of probably five a day when they have 16 beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| which means they're operating at somewhere around 30 to 35 percent capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| I'm not sure if we're funding that 100 percent capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| or for the amount that they're actually treating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| I spoke with Jason Lay today, and I am going to meet with him next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| We received information very late in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| I just want to meet with him and go over this to make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| one, that people are getting the treatment they needed and the service they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| and that our taxpayers are getting the efficiencies they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Any additional follow-up questions, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| What I might do is, if we've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| Yeah, I'll kind of look to the body on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I'm sure that I think that there's probably some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| who've been sent a link from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| I know we've also gotten the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| I guess, knowing that we'll have about a week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| to do a little bit of homework or additional follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| if there's someone from Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| I'm not sure if it's Houston or Jerry, has been Zoomed to link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| Before we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6178)|
| 1:42:58| And by the way, for my fellow commissioners, just because we're Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I know we've got a long meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I'm planning on maybe taking a five to 10 minute break at around seven o'clock or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| You can turn your cameras off and we'll take a quick five to 10 minute break around seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| But if Jerry or Houston's here that would just like to kind of give an update on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| I think that would be appropriate for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| But before then, I do recognize that Commissioner Schoonmaker has got a hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Obviously, Commissioner Smith, you've done the research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| Basically, you said it was about 500 patients per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| Was that roughly the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I couldn't quite hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| The information I gave us today, it was like 376 through three quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| If you extrapolate that out, it's about 125 patients a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| which comes to a little bit five to five 10 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6238)|
| 1:43:58| And so we're spending about $3,000 on them for a 24 hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| There are other services that they provide once they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| And that's some of the information I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| How much is the follow-up services that are provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Yeah, I think, yeah, the Commissioner's point you just made is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| if I might, Commissioner Smith, take the liberty of restating your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| It's sort of say, all right, if you look at it purely from the admissions point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| here's the math, here's the census for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| But then part of your follow-up question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| so what does the case management look like post-discharge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| And knowing that some of this money that we don't see on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| and we see this, how much are they investing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| in terms of case management, that said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| So I think I see Houston Smeltzer from Helen Ross McNabb on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| So I'll go ahead and recognize him, unless your boss, Jerry, is also around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| Houston, it's for yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you, Chair Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| If you would let Jason Lay's connection speak, we're all three together on his link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6304)|
| 1:45:12| It's actually, in terms of links, that's going to be up to Mr. Rob Link to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| I think Jason's already in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| He just needs to turn his mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| It's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| I don't want to disturb any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| And if multiple people in the room have got microphones on or whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| you guys need to turn that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| because I think that can kind of create feedback that makes it sound horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| So Jason, if you're there, we'll hand the floor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| And just turn it down to one mic, if there's multiple folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| Can you hear us now, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| We thought we'd all get in the same room to make it easier for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| us to answer Commission's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| And I'm trying to leave the meeting so that I'm not creating a background issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6359)|
| 1:46:10| OK, I think we're all ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Can you hear us OK, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| You, now you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| Can you hear us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Yes, I can hear you fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| Sorry, I was muting myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| I'm here with Jason Lay, our CFO, and Leanne Human-Hilliard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6384)|

| 1:46:43| or next Monday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| The Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center is a program that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| created by the city of Knoxville and Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| It took about a 10-year process to develop this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| as a way to address overcrowding in Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| As Commissioner Smith mentioned, last year, this program received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| a pretty good gut punch in terms of a funding cut from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| And so we retooled the programming to work with the budgeting dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| that we had available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| So we're happy to address any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| Leanne has lots of clinical data that I think would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| as you consider approving this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| I do know that we're on city council's agenda tomorrow night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| for their piece of the funding for the same program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6449)|
| 1:47:39| What I might do just to kind of open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| I mean, can you give me kind of an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| I know there'll be some follow-up with Mr. Lay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| But right now, there may be some additional questions next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| But can you just add a maybe 30,000 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| talk a little bit about the outcomes that y'all are getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| You talked fiscally about where the program had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| after the state changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| But I mean, ultimately, I know there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| some additional research between now and Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| But just that more of a 30,000 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| kind of a little more info on the outcomes that you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Leanne has been collecting more data for this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| than maybe any other program we operate at the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| And she has most of that in her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| So I'll turn it over to Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| I will just give you that pretty far backdrop outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| of what our outcomes are looking like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Commissioner Smith was exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| We changed from a 72-hour unit to a 24-hour unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| In doing so, we wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| that we heard from commission last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| their concerns on a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| We heard that, or I heard that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| you know, we liked the concept of being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| to get individuals diverted from jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| That was very important, bypassing that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| and getting stabilized for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| who have a mental illness or substance use disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| The feedback we did get was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| even though we were having some great outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| on engaging people in their first appointment post-program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| into outpatient mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| we couldn't tell you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| if they were getting follow-up appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| The other thing that we heard is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| we didn't have a lot of outcome data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| around housing and around employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| So when we revamped the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| we reduced the 24-hour or the 72 to 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| and reduced the capacity to six beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| So we were having to find savings where we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and balancing that on the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| of what we were seeing being utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| at the drop-off center of the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| We also then increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| created a very intensive community-based service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| And that's what you're gonna see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| in the documents called FACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| It's an evidence-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Forensic Assertive Community Treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| So those are designed to be extremely intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| There is no other level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| like that in our community right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| unless you have insurance through TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| and meet a lot of criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| So it was a huge gap in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| And I think it was a gap for the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| that we saw coming through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| So some of the outcomes that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| we still see mostly males,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| although we see a significant amount of females,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| about 60% are gonna be male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| The average age are still in their 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| That's what we're continuing to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| 70% of the individuals we're serving remain uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| So that is a real particular challenge for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| because they aren't eligible for any benefits at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| and can't get a lot of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| So we're relying on safety net funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| and funding for the uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| 50% of the individuals that we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| are coming in homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| So no insurance, no housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| 50% have a co-occurring mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| So all of the individuals that we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| have either a mental health or substance use disorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| over 50% have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| And we track that when our clinicians and physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| are seeing when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| We are still seeing a large number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| who come into the drop-off center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| receive or accept referrals to go to an outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| mental health or substance use appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| where 68% of them are still making that appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| which is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| Your private insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| your TennCare insurance companies benchmark that around 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| And so 68 is really good at keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| that initial appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| For individuals, after they come to the drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| portion of the BUC, if they are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| I'm trying the best way to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| If they have more challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| then they might be eligible for that next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| within the BUC program called the FACT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| And we're seeing about 50% of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| rolling into that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| They are the ones who are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| the very intensive community-based services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| We're seeing increase in employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| We're seeing increase in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| We keep the individuals at an average of three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| some longer, some shorter if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| It's all based on individual need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| And then 48% over all of our individuals that we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| never go back and have another jail day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| for six months after they leave our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| And that's compared to a national benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| of about 68 that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| And then we've seen a very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| a small amount of people return to the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| That's still hovering around 18% of recidivism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| back to the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| So we're still happy with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| We don't want to see a revolving door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| but we certainly want to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| who are in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| who have a mental illness, who are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| They're not having insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| They're not being engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| with their mental health centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| even if that is us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| because of all of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| that they are presented with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| And so I'm very proud of what the program has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| They have served over 500 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| They were on track to do the same this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| And we are still opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| opened in the midst of COVID and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| The clinicians and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| have been doing a fantastic job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| of still meeting the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| of those people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Commissioner Smith, you got a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| I was kind of surprised that 31% does have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Are we billing their insurance companies for the services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| So I think that's pretty challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| because if they have commercial insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| their commercial insurance may or may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| accept that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| You know, it's a little bit of a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| to get that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| You know, a lot of that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| you have to get pre-authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| And, you know, that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I don't think they consider jail diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| much of a diversion concern for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| But we are working with the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| to see if we can get any of these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| connected with the Behavioral Health Safety Net Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| So, you know, our goal is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| we secure as much third party as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| even though it's very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| But if we can't do it for the first day of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| we certainly want to see if we can encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| before we reconnect them with other programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| And do we have a number on how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| are making second and third appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| And I believe you had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| did you say we're down to six beds there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| What is the rest of that facility being used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| So that facility is being used to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| all of the community-based service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| So it's a very small facility when you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| But then what we've done is turned in the other two bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| into the office staff for the FACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| the community-based component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| Now all of their service is being provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| in the homes, in the community, in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| And they're the outreach, I call it the outreach program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| That's a great name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| That's outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| So basically 48% of the people that come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| and I know it's better than the national mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| but still 48% are winding up back in the jellet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| within six months from coming into the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| And you said something about providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| up to three months after their visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Now that can vary depending on their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| but the FACT portion of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| is really designed to capture people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| if you sent them to an outpatient service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| they might not be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| or they may need something more intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| but not quite meet the need of inpatient hospitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| They need something in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6972)|
| 1:56:12| And I appreciate you talking to me earlier today and Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| And I'll save the rest of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| because I know this meeting is going to run long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| I look forward to meeting with you all this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6987)|
| 1:56:27| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Next, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| On page seven of your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| you talked about the economic impact of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| or the economic cost of what it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| to have somebody in jail for a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| versus what it has, having somebody in the beehive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| On the reverse side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| do you have any data that talks about the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| or social impact of people after the fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| If they don't go through the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| what might it cost society in a greater scheme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| versus if they go through the beehive program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| what it might cost society in the greater umbrella of services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| I know that's a big data point to capture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| but I know that you guys think about that of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| this is all to do with the cost analysis of the beehive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Is it worth the investment on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| To save money societally on the back end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| Do you look at that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| All of our outcomes and data comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| through our quality and compliance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| So I will get with them to see all of the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| that they kind of point to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| and we can certainly have that ready for you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| But I will say, depending on what report you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| it's savings anywhere from EDs to inpatient hospitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| which are thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| Jail days for individuals who need psychotropic medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| and increased involvement in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7082)|

| 1:58:10| And then some research will capture quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| which is hard to price tag on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| But I can certainly pull that and have that ready for you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7096)|

| 1:58:31| some more discussion next week on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7113)|

| 1:59:29| Okay, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Now, as I said earlier, now is, in fact, usually when we have our face-to-face meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| if we're not done, we usually take a break here at about 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| So, what my recommendation is to my fellow commissioners is maybe put stop video or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| you know, turn off your video, turn off your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| You know, I'll take a 10, 12-minute break here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| Zach, if you, it's kind of like the movies, I guess, where you can post your intermission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7195)|
| 1:59:55| I don't know if you have that capability or not, but do not log off of the Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| We are not going to start a new meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| We're just going to take a break, and I'll see everybody in about 12 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7211)|
| 2:00:11| We'll go ahead and start the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Welcome back from our little recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| So, we just closed out on the Hall and Ross McNabb item, so, and that was approved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7217)|
| 2:00:25| sent forward with no recommendation to next week's meeting, which is going to be Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| So, Madam Clerk, what's the next item on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| We're on item number 38, which is Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| It's approving a formal internal service fund reserve policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7242)|
| 2:00:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7242)|
| 2:00:42| Can I get a motion on this one, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Skinmaker, and who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7252)|
| 2:00:52| The second was Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7254)|
| 2:00:54| That's the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| I'm going to go ahead and recognize Mr. Caldwell from the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Basically, what we're doing here is putting more, an additional policy in place that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| help with our rating agencies with movies and S&P as we go forward and expect, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| a downturn in revenue related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| So, what this does is just allows us to move any excess fund balance from those particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7283)|
| 2:01:34| balance sheets up front to the general fund, and it'll be in a committed state and can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| be spent for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| But it just gets it on the front of their financial statements so the agencies can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7306)|
| 2:01:46| And they also like when you put more controls in place and measure it, it shows that management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7306)|
| 2:01:53| is taking things serious and looking just to make us, I guess, more whole from a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| Okay, there may be some other questions, but I mean, my personal take, if I might weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| in on this one first, was that when I read through all of the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| that you had proposed for changes to the department, the way we allocate and do transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7332)|
| 2:02:20| it looked like, especially in light of our current situation, that in a way, you're sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| of ratifying or putting in writing a lot of the things that we probably would have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| And by doing that, also put in a way that more clearly communicates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| But they all struck me as things that a prudent business person would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| But now, it's in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| At least that was kind of my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| And I think that was what I mentioned when I called you about it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| Yeah, you're spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| And that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| And this is the first policy of two that we will bring, as I mentioned to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Next month, we will bring a contingency spending plan to have you all adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| We'll consider and hopefully adopt as it relates that we've already got basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| in principle that we put in place that we want to put it in writing, which helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| just to codify all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Any of the stuff, Ben, is this kind of consistent with what the GFOA has recommended as municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| finance departments across the country have been going through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| Yes, it's recommended guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| And we kind of took our policy from them and some others that we thought were good models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7408)|
| 2:03:38| And ultimately, it's just we have a general fund balance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| So it just kind of strengthens along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| We already have a debt service policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| So we just want to expand on what we've already got in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| OK, thank you, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| I noticed in the policy section three, it talks about the reserve levels of three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7438)|

| 2:04:06| There's been a lot of talk about the fund balance of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| And can you help me just understand what a normal three months of what that reserve level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| minimum would often look like dollar wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7459)|
| 2:04:19| So with internal service funds, it will vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| Like we have we have a vehicle service fund, which is operated by Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| So it's this level will be fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| But then on the other spectrum, you'll have our self-insured health insurance fund, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7474)|
| 2:04:43| self-insured health insurance fund, which we have about a 30 million dollar budget to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| So you just do three months of that and that can be six, eight, eight million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| And so we have about six or eight different vehicle service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| We have internal service funds from building maintenance, but you got about 11 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| dollar budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| And we also have like a mail room service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| So all these funds and basically what happens is we charge for these services and it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| be expensed to the county departments and the revenues moved in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| So all we're basically saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Guys, can you turn that off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7527)|

| 2:07:51| question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7671)|

| 2:07:59| I ain't, you know, I'm pro Second Amendment as anybody, but Mr. Law Director, does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| have any bearing on the laws that we follow or possibly could follow if it comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| a state or federal government in regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| Does this change anything if we adopt this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| It only just shows a policy position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| The current law, the Second Amendment, of course, the federal trumps everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| And the limitation on the state is totally about carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| And that's the only restriction that the state legislature has other than, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7714)|
| 2:08:41| you know, reckless endangerment and those type things that are criminal acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| And this is a policy decision made on the board by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| Any legal questions would be answered by the Second Amendment and would be answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| by the Tennessee Constitution, because we personally don't have any regulatory rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| at the county level to do anything with guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| When you say it's a policy decision, what policy does it create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| Whatever you all are saying that you want to do is to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| It's a statement of support to the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| It's more of a political statement than it is a legal statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7761)|
| 2:09:29| Let me demute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Mr. Law Director, I may have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| This sort of falls into, you know, almost in the charms area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| And I kind of may have answered this to be perfectly frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| This is something I was paying attention to months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| And a lot of COVID, until today came up, I really haven't put that much time into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| But one clarifying question on this one is, you know, and you just said that ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7793)|
| 2:10:00| everything is up to the feds and the state in terms of any actual policy that's meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| I guess my question was, you know, Commissioner Anders and I had worked together in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| in areas where you see orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| And often with orders of protection, you have folks who have been, their right to care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| firearm, especially when they're around the person that maybe filed the order of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| You know, I just, I wonder, you know, how does this apply in that case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| What if you've got somebody who's, say, a defense attorney for somebody who's got an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| order of protection, or if we try to send a sheriff's guy out to arrest somebody for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| breaking the order, and then they were to say, well, you use the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| I just, I wanted to make sure that we're not kind of throwing a bone to folks who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7846)|
| 2:10:53| wanting to use that as a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| That's the first thing that kind of went through my mind on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| The ranking order, of course, anything, a resolution is below an ordinance, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| Number two, the order of protection is statutory, and it falls under the criminal issues of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| the state, which they have total authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| And we, our resolutions or ordinances, unless they are totally verbatim in alignment, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| we don't have any jurisdiction over, would have no bearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| So the truth is, the Second Amendment will be a federal issue in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| The order of protections would be a state issue under state criminal law, and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| also fall under state civil law as it relates to civil type orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| So anytime a gun would be involved, it would be at the state level, and we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| jurisdiction at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| So even whatever we do as a resolution, you're basically saying that we're supporting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| federal law and we're supporting the state law as written, because there's nothing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| And then I actually, was it Larson or John, I'm not sure which one of you clicked your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| I'll go with Commissioner Jay first and then follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| All right, John, you're pointing him, but on my screen, he's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| So Commissioner Jay first, and then Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| I have, second questions I have are for the law department, but if you'll allow me, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| have a question for our sponsors of the bill, which could be Commissioner Daley or Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7955)|
| 2:12:43| It's a pretty basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| What problem does this solve for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| This is not a problem solver at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| It's nothing to do with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| It's nothing to do with the federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| This is just a statement that we in Knox County support the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| We raised our right hand and swore by the Constitution of the United States and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| state of Tennessee and the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| And part of this is that we support the Second Amendment and we, you know, since the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7987)|
| 2:13:15| crisis has come about, we don't hear as much, but we did, you know, we got the red flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| laws, we've got other laws, other states that are going beyond what really the Second Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| That's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| It does not, it does not cover any type of laws or whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| This is just a statement that says, I personally believe in the Second Amendment and that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8014)|
| 2:13:42| will defend the Second Amendment as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| And it's nothing besides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| This resolution has no teeth as far as protecting any law or overriding law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| This is just stating that I believe that the citizens of Knox, that we should support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8036)|
| 2:14:05| right to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Just to follow up on that, when we all took our oath of office, we swore by oath that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| we uphold the Constitution, the state of Tennessee laws and state of Tennessee Constitution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| the charter of Knox County, which includes everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| And in doing something like this, you know, why are we reaffirming one constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| amendment in our Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| Constitutional amendment, not all the constitutional amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| I mean, it's, we've all done this, all 11 of us took the same oath and we've all pledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| allegiance or pledged our oath to uphold all of those constitutional laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| And I just, you know, it seems an unnecessary use of our legislative time to then single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8089)|
| 2:14:56| out one of those, you know, 11 and move, you know, one of those and move on from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| And then it opens up, I'll go to my second question to continue, you know, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| And that's really for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| By doing this, does this open up Knox County to further liability, whether it be to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8109)|
| 2:15:17| with guns or something else, perhaps, you know, does it open us up to somebody filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| a lawsuit against Knox County saying, you know, any number of other things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8121)|
| 2:15:29| constitutional rights, does it say you're picking and choosing which ones you affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| and don't affirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8134)|
| 2:15:34| I mean, does it open us up to further lawsuits, which will cost time and will cost money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8134)|
| 2:15:44| Well, Commissioner, it's hard to speculate on what people will sue over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| I'm amazed almost every day at some things that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| I don't see that it gives you any more exposure on a policy decision any more than you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| already said, that I take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| And anything you do enhance or otherwise to that, you still have that pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8166)|
| 2:16:13| So I don't see as long as you're in, it's like being in alignment with the state on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8173)|
| 2:16:22| any mandate that you have 11th Amendment protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| So if you're in alignment with the federal government, you have protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| If you're in alignment with the Constitution, you have protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| If you're in alignment with the state Constitution and all, theirs is limited to carry, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| And basically, we don't vote on anything to do with guns anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| Under our power, we can only affirm what we've already done or what our limits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8205)|
| 2:16:52| Uh, so I don't see where we would have much exposure one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| under that we don't already have under the Second Amendment or under the state Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| Mr. Armstrong, I've, I've heard you say many times over the years that one commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| shouldn't act on items that tell or hinder future commissions, wouldn't this not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8228)|
| 2:17:16| All this commission is saying is that they support the Second Amendment and every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| that is sworn in is saying they support the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| So it's not in conflict with what you, what every commissioner is required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| So I don't know that it's any different than an oath of office, whereby you're upholding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| the Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| So this would be probably an exception, even, even if you were doing the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8257)|
| 2:17:45| Back to your point, you know, how many do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| There, you're, you're not holding any future commissioner to any standard that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| not already going to be held to, above your resolution is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| And just to clarify, you, you did say that federal and state laws supersede local laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| and, and we, this essentially has no legal teeth to it that isn't already, uh, directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8285)|
| 2:18:12| by the state or the federal level, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| This is just a personal policy statement on behalf of each individual commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Mr. Chairman, may I respond to the original question as a co-sponsor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| Go ahead, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| Yeah, I, you know, I think with all that's been discussed and the law director's answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| and so forth, the question is the legitimate question is, well, if it has no teeth, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| why aren't we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| Um, I think that there is a perception among a lot of folks, especially in our part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| the, of the world, our part of the country, that the second amendment is uniquely under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| attack, especially among the first 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| Um, you know, I, for instance, I'm not a, I'm not a, a, a gun enthusiast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8335)|
| 2:19:01| I'm not a gun collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| I'm not even a hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| You know, I don't have anything against it, but, but I don't have time and love football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| too much to be a hunter and, uh, but I'm a constitutionalist and I think that the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| amendment is so sacred, uh, that our founders put it second in, in, in, in the bill of rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8354)|
| 2:19:21| as they began to amend the constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| They didn't put it ninth or 10th or 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| They put it second because if you're going to have a free constitutional republic where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| individuals are free to speak their mind, worship as they please and own private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| then it is simply inherent that they have to have the right to protect themselves, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| they say and their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| And so I think in declaring a second amendment, a constitutional county or sanctuary county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| what are you going to call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| Um, it's a declaration that in Knox County, we do not welcome any mitigation of the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8392)|
| 2:20:01| amendment rights based on whatever ideological winds might be blowing in Washington at any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| And we do not welcome any federal regulations that would usurp second amendment rights of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| It's a declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| If you think it's an unnecessary declaration or one that you don't agree with, then obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| you wouldn't want to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| But that's that's the reason for it from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| Aaron, if I am permitted to just kind of go ahead, you guys are having a civil conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| And you asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| Commissioner Beeler responded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| And if you've got to follow up, that's that's that's, you know what, that's how we're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| So go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| And just looking at the resolution, I mean, it it clearly says Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| of Knox County will not authorize or appropriate government funds, resources, employees, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| contractors, buildings or offices for the purpose of enforcing or assisting in the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| of any element of such acts, laws, orders, mandates, rules or regulations that are fringe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| around the people to right and bear arms as described by the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| So let's say let's just play a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| Let's say something changes on a federal level with our with our laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| Any could be a constitutional amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Again, it could be a different law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Or let's say something changes on a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| This is essentially saying that, you know, we would not enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| You know, I guess it goes back to as described by the United Supreme Court or the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| Court of the Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| So, you know, I guess if those are changed, we would have to follow those laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8494)|
| 2:21:42| But it also sort of it mixes words and saying we're not going to authorize anybody to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| anything except if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| But that's that's exactly how we operate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| And that's what's so confusing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| If we have laws that say we must do X, Y and Z based on a federal or state level, we follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| those laws and we implement those laws and we put resources against those laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| So it essentially changes nothing about what we're currently operating under right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| And that's the part that's a little confusing as to why are we spending time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| reaffirming the thing that we do currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| We don't do that for the other one through seven articles or the one through twenty seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| So that I think that maybe we're talking in the same thing, but that's just confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| as to why to single this one out unless it is purely for a political gain or some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8547)|
| 2:22:33| of way to polarize factions of people unnecessarily, because we do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| OK, I'm not sure, Mr. Bailey, you've already weighed in, Mr. Jay, you had a follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| I'm going to move down the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| I know Mr. Schoonmaker had chimed in earlier and Mr. Buehler, I'm seeing that your blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| hand is still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| I'm not sure if you want to respond real quick there or then we can move on to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| So I would just like to respond and say, you know, with all due respect to my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| it's not for political gain to make a declaration to protect the Second Amendment rights of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8584)|
| 2:23:11| constituents that have asked us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| And the overwhelming majority of the emails I received on this have asked us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| And so that's my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| Commissioner Daley, as a sponsor, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8608)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| I agree with Commissioner Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| I agree with Commissioner Buehler that it's overwhelming support for for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| And, you know, if you don't if you don't want to support the resolution, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| If you want to support it, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| It's not it's it's not there for political gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| And, you know, I take exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| I'm not going I just that's not what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| This is about Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| Whether Winnos County as a commissioner, I speaking as I only I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8642)|
| 2:24:09| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| We could do a resolution to answer Commissioner Jay's and I don't really want a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| Yeah, we could do all all the amendments, all the Bill of Rights, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8656)|
| 2:24:22| you know, we confirm every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| But it seems like, as Commissioner Buehler has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| we are under attack on the two way on the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| And there's not much more that we can say that, you know, our founding fathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8671)|
| 2:24:38| thought long and hard and Commissioner Buehler is 100 percent correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| It was the second item under the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| And it's not going to change any laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| It's not going to affect anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| It's just saying that Carson Daly will vote yes to affirm the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| And that's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| We've got I'll let and I'm frankly, I'm not sure who weighed in first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| either Commissioner Gill or Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| But I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| I'm sorry, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8715)|
| 2:25:15| I'm sorry, John, you were the first ones in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| Sorry, I was mentally moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| So go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| And then we'll go Commissioner Schoonmaker, then Gill, then Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| Possibly maybe the two sponsors of the resolution would like to do just a quick recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8727)|
| 2:25:35| It's my understanding that this type of a resolution is passed in 58 of the 95 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8735)|
| 2:25:44| in Tennessee, and there may be some more current information to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| So basically, 875 of our colleagues across the state have already affirmed that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8749)|
| 2:25:56| support the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| So before next Tuesday night, maybe the sponsors would like to take the opportunity to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| get the current data of actually how many counties in Tennessee have have already signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8763)|
