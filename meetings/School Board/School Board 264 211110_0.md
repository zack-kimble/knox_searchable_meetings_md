| 0:11:27| We appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| We have a 25-page PowerPoint that we're going to go through very quickly, and we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| this in Shelby County already, and we got through in about 10 minutes, and what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| is just describe real briefly what the bill does, and if you have any questions, stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| us and we'll try to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| But before we get into just a quick background on CLASS, the organization we represent at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| the legislature, CLASS is a coalition of the four large urban school systems, was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| here in Knoxville in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| We represent both the administration and school board members as legislation is going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| And since we were here last time, there have been four legislative sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| The first was held in January as a special session to address learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| There were three bills that were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| Very quickly, the first bill we call the summer school bill, and that set up the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| for the summer school classes that were held for the first time this summer under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| new law to address learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| The second bill is the Hold Harmless bill on TCAP results for the 2020-2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=771)|
| 0:13:04| And the last bill that passed is a literacy bill that outlines how literacy is taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| from kindergarten through third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| And then in our regular session this year, there were a broad range of topics that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| addressed by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| We have a list here that will look through a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| There were several discussions around curriculum as it relates to gender, sexuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| We want to make sure that parents are aware of the information that students are receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| There is specific legislation to require student-athletes to participate in a sports team based on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| gender assigned at birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I think we've already seen some court challenges around that this year, so that's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| something we'll be watching to see if the legislature has to come back and take additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| action to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| There are some more flexibility around social-emotional learning, and then the STEM Advancement Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| There was a specific bill in place to prohibit Common Core designated curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Another bathroom requirement bill we've highlighted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| A particular topic of discussion this year was third grade retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| We all understand that kids who are not performing well in third grade are going to struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| as they move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| The Commissioner of Education and the Governor have spent a lot of time, energy, and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| in focusing on improving those third grade outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| A lot of those resources are tied toward retention for all students in third grades who are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| performing at grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| We know that sometimes there are reasons, and parents may have other wishes for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| own children, and the legislature has made it clear that they think that parents should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| be able to weigh in on those decisions for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| So this creates some flexibility for parents to weigh in around that retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=903)|
| 0:15:13| And then during the regular session, we had several bills related to vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| Public Chapter 369 creates some exemptions for vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=919)|
| 0:15:30| Several bills, such as Public Chapter 471, related to the Textbook Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| That sets up a waiver process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| And then Public Chapter 479, the last bill on that slide, requires all districts to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| an open enrollment period where students can apply to go to schools that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=944)|
| 0:15:53| zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| You all have the good fortune of already having a robust open enrollment plan, so we'll already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| be in compliance without a great deal of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Public Chapter 493 deletes any references and creates a specific prohibition on critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| race theory being taught in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| There was a specific component to change the way that charter school employees can participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| in group insurance plans to offer more flexibility to those charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| Then Public Chapter 490 creates a path by which schools transition out of the ASD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| The ASD, as you know, has returned most of the—or is in the process of returning schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| back to their original districts, and this clarifies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| Public Chapter 398 is another hold harmless bill, and this is related to the ADM loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| that almost every district experienced during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Last year there were about 30,000 fewer students who attended—who were counted in the ADM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| for the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| This bill held districts harmless as far as BEP distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| I will mention—we'll talk about this a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| There were some very strong feelings, and a lot of statements said that this was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| only year that the legislature was prepared to hold districts harmless in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1040)|
| 0:17:29| Public Chapter 589 allows per-pupil spending to follow the student when they are a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| at a residential mental health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1057)|
| 0:17:49| Public Chapter 96 specifically addresses the authority on who can make decisions to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and close a school during a public health emergency, and gives you all very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Public Chapter 452 requires that a student who requests privacy in a restroom based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1084)|

| 0:18:16| private restroom facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1096)|

| 0:18:24| gender of choice versus their gender assigned at birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1104)|
| 0:18:35| Public Chapter 513 is another vaccination bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| It is specific to the COVID-19 vaccination and prohibits mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1118)|
| 0:18:47| We'll talk about some other bills that were passed in the just-ended special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| also related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Public Chapter 519 requires districts to post your curriculum on the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1136)|
| 0:19:07| Public Chapter 161 clarifies some of the rules around reporting of child abuse to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| that if a child has a concern about a parent or guardian, that that parent or guardian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| is not notified without going through appropriate DCS protocols to offer additional protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1162)|

| 0:19:33| an appropriate disciplinary situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And then if we want to look at Public Chapter 211, creates flexibility around teacher licensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1175)|
| 0:19:44| to allow teachers to teach a subject for a short period of time if you don't have a licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| teacher for that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| There's a specific definition of teacher for the purposes of teacher raises each year in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Public Chapter 248 to make sure that those raises are first prioritized with people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1200)|

| 0:21:05| exam and it's a work ready exam that would give the student a certificate that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1265)|

| 0:21:31| be a part of this pilot and what they will do is identify a consultant to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| work with the school for three years to try to turn the school around, but that is a limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1299)|
| 0:21:48| time on that pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| It's also a voluntary program, so it will be principals who want to have this additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| intervention in their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1315)|

| 0:22:41| Public Chapter 310 streamlines the procurement process a little bit so that it allows you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1361)|

| 0:23:36| with no further incidents that the legislature talked very openly about how we all may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| made bad decisions in the past but have worked hard to turn our lives around and shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1421)|

| 0:24:10| I think the last slide we have dealing with the regular session is the budget slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| It is $120 million for teacher salaries, $70 million for BEP growth and you can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| rest of those numbers including the $250 million investment in the mental health trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| There was also in the first special session $86 million appropriated to help pay for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| of the requirements of the summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| And then I guess two weeks ago we were in the last special session, second special session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| of October and that slide has what we refer to as the COVID-19 omnibus bill and we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1495)|
| 0:25:04| you have heard a lot about this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| There has been a question whether or not, whether and when the governor would sign the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| He said this afternoon that he would sign the bill and indicated he would sign that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| That is important because every part of this bill becomes effective as soon as he signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I am sure you are familiar with a lot of the provisions that prohibit school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| from mandating COVID-19 vaccines and prohibits adverse action if a person refuses or does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| not have, does not receive the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| The next issue is mask mandates, prohibits mask mandates unless the governor has declared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| a state of emergency allowing mask mandates and also there has to be a 14 day rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| average of 1,000 per 100,000 residents in the county that is measured by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1561)|
| 0:26:12| And even if those things are in place, the mandate would have to be requested by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| school, by the school principal, to the district school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| If that is approved, the district would have to provide N-19 masks to persons, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| is everybody that would be coming into the school 12 years or older and similar masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| to the N-19 masks would have to be provided to anybody younger than 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| The part where a lot of people have been speculating may be challenged, there is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| allowance for an ADA opt-out and the way the bill is drafted, it may be in conflict with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| federal law, but those are the provisions around the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| The other part of the bill gives the commissioner of health sole authority to determine quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| guidelines and then the bill prohibits any use of public funds for enforcement of federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:25| COVID-19 related mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| I'll stop right there and see if there are any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| Again, it's our understanding the governor is going to sign that bill later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1657)|
| 0:27:45| The second big piece of legislation from our special session last week was Senate Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| 9009, which allows for the partisan election of school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| That will be determined by your local party chairs, that it allows both a partisan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| nonpartisan option, but your local Democrat and Republican parties will determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| or not they want to have a primary for each of your races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| Political parties will nominate those candidates based on the rules that they have in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| local party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Some may be an elected primary and some may be a closed election within active members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| of party leadership, depending on how your county is structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:30| Before we talk about issues that we're going to be watching in 2022, I want to give a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| update on the Education Savings Account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| That program is still funded in the state budget, the money is still in the base budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| It has not been spent for the two years that that bill has been in effect because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| challenge from Shelby and Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| The Supreme Court heard an oral argument in that lawsuit in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| We're still waiting for the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| So that is yet to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| So we want to share this list, I think there are two more slides after this one, of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| that we're going to be watching in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| First is the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| As you know, the governor has appointed several committees to take a look at redoing the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| K-12 funding formula, and all indications are that they are planning to file a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| in January or February after the work of those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| And we're watching, I think there are two or three more town halls, and I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| biggest question that's not been answered definitively is whether there will be a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| amount of new investment in K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We understand there's going to be a reconfiguration of the formula, but I guess we'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| wait and see when the governor submits his budget at the end of January to see exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| what's going to be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| We've already talked about ADM Hold Harmless and the bill that was passed back in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| that did hold districts harmless for ADM loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| It's our understanding from a meeting or some comments at a BP review committee a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| of weeks ago, there are even more than 30,000 students less in the system this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| So I'm not sure what the situation is in Knox County, but it looks like the students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| we lost have not come back and there are more students that have left the public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| We're not sure exactly what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| In our conversations with leadership, especially in the House, they have indicated that mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| health is going to be a big issue that they continue to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| One of the ways they have talked about possibly addressing that is funding more nurses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| That's something that we have pushed for for several years, so we hope that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| year that they finally lower those ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| One issue, I guess a combined issue, the issue of attendance was the subject of a day-long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| discussion summer study back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| So we expect that there to be legislation brought about chronic absenteeism and truancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| And truancy has been a subject of recent legislation, but there is concern that even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| before COVID that the instances of chronic absenteeism were too high across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| And that's an issue we learned in the summer study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| It's not necessarily something aimed at the urban districts, it's a problem all across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| And then after the new required summer school, we are hearing that there may be proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| for year-round school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Obviously that will cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| We think more than the $86 million that was appropriated for summer school this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| but that is something that we have heard from several legislators that they are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| in discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| Testing is a perennially hot topic at the legislature, and we feel like this year, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| the legislature having accommodated a lot of flexibility around testing, that it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| they will talk about quite intensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| We will still look at additional hold harmless penalties for teachers, students, classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| We'll look at a testing calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I think that part of the discussion of year-round school means that that testing window may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| look different next year because of where our calendar days might fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Testing time limits and paper and online testing are a hot topic that I know that it's much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| easier and faster to score results on an online test, but there are a number of legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| particularly in rural areas, who don't feel that that is appropriate for students just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| yet, that they don't necessarily have the online skills that they might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| So we anticipate a lot of discussion around that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| We also saw a lot of discussion last year around ACT in lieu of TINREADY, that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| already a nationally accredited test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Every student takes it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Maybe we could use that in place of TINREADY, as TINREADY has struggled with some implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| in the past, so we'll continue to look for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| We have to be certain that we are prepared to meet new additional federal standards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| average measurable objectives, and I think that there is a policy discussion around shifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| from standardized testing to progress monitoring to see how students grow throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| which certainly for younger children is something that I think we all would love to see more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| robust discussion around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| The legislature has strong feelings about TVOS, and we know that TVOS is important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| see to monitor growth in successful schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| It's important to see changes in schools that are struggling, so we will be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| to see how the legislature deals with looking at TVOS again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| On those last two issues, I'll mention real quickly, we have spent in the last 10 or 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| years, I've been involved with education policy, we spend a lot of time paying attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| what Florida does, and you may have seen a few weeks ago, Governor DeSantis proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| a shift away from standardized testing to progress monitoring and evaluation of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| and spoke very strongly against continuing standardized tests, so it will be interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| to see if that becomes a national conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| But that's the end of our presentation, I'd be glad to try to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| Sorry, we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Our presentation is very long, we try not to give you guys so much information all at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| once, but there's just been a lot this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| We will monitor the use of TANF funds in schools this year, that Tennessee has a large reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| of temporary assistance for needy families, and there are some specific school services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| that may fall under that umbrella, so we'll be watching as the legislature develops their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| The legislature has allocated a certain portion of those TANF dollars for grant programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| so we'll be watching to see if there's school services that fall underneath that umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Class size ratios are something that we're going to look at, the legislature has talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| quite a bit about flexibility around class sizes, A-F grading for school buildings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| a perennial topic of discussion here at the legislature that was postponed this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| because of all the hold harmless provisions for COVID, we anticipate that will be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| that will be discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Medicaid takeover is something that we feel will be a hot topic this year, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| have been a number of legislative leaders who have expressed concerns about individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| schools and school districts' COVID policies, and we anticipate them bringing some legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| to try and put more controls on some districts around that, so we'll be watching to see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| those fold out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| And we perennially list the last two because we know these have been issues in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| particularly, the portfolio model for teacher evaluation and required physical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| On required physical education, this is the first school year that that law that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| probably three years ago now has actually been in effect, and there were a lot of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| districts that woke up in June and realized they were going to have to hire a lot of PE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| teachers. That was not the assumption that was put forth whenever that bill was being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| passed. We know that you had that experience or you realized that a lot earlier than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| lot of other districts, but we expect some discussion on that because this is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| year that that's been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question on slide 15. It's Public Chapter 552, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| Tennessee Work Ready Opportunity Program. Did you say that there's an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| students to take a work ready test rather than the ACT, so the ACT that's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| required for all students to take, there's another option? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| This would be the second. If they were going to take the ACT for a second time, the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| test could be this work ready test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So they do still have to take the ACT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Still have to take the ACT one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to make sure everybody understands that while this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| is a lot of information, the bills that they follow for us each year, there are hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| of them, literally. And they follow those bills and look at all of the possible implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| for our large four school districts. And they meet with us with representatives from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| those large districts every Friday to find out if there are other implications that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| they are not aware of. And we all can discuss those and determine what our priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| to really let our legislators know how those bills can impact our school districts. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| the work that they're doing for us is really huge. I'm not sure we would ever be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| follow those hundreds of bills on our own. So it's really greatly appreciated. And thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| you for traveling all the way here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2348)|

| 0:39:19| as a service and I know the work that you put in, but I am curious for my own records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| what is the cost of your services to KCS? What do we pay you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| The cost of our annual fee, we charge each district $37,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And it's been that since we started working for you in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Does anyone else have any other questions? Okay. And thank you for coming and traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2386)|
| 0:39:59| and for that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=2399)|

| 0:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| And next we have Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Police Station County residents, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| Thank you, Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| I spoke to you guys last week, and some people said, you need to tell them that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| So here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| I want to say that I think you guys are being too hasty with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| The last time we hired a superintendent, we had an interim superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| who did a fine job of keeping things going while we did a careful search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| We have many fine staff within the administration who could be interim superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| while we took our time to do a careful search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| and I don't think it's really necessary to take the aggressive schedule that you guys have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| So that's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| You know, it's, I don't know, it's the old saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| You know, you decide or act in haste and you can regret at leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| So I would encourage you to think about whether you really need to do this, all this, this fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| I think that's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I guess I do want to tell you that the, no, that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| So that concludes public forum on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| I didn't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Patty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Could you talk to us a little bit about how the meeting schedule is expected to work during that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3280)|
| 0:54:49| I've heard from several classified employees who are concerned about that being at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| Are we expecting anyone who wants to be there to be there, or is it just a focus group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| What exactly are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Yes, so that was how we did ask that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| So this recommended schedule is for the idea of people to come, but anybody can attend any meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| So if someone can't make it to the 1.30, they can come to the 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| The same questions are going to be asked at all of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| It's just their recommendation was that they have it within those groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| because they usually have similar themes on what they want and what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| So it just makes it that much smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| But anybody can come to any meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Again, I just want to reiterate that she did request that board members only attend that first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| and not attend the other ones, but you're free to go to wherever you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| Can I ask about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| So they want us to come to the classified employee one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| No, we're going to the Betsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| Okay, I'm just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| I'm looking at these four meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Are there more meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Am I not seeing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Online, there's one that's at 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Yeah, there's one in the morning that they recommend we come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| and then the other ones would be geared towards those other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| But anybody is welcome to attend if they cannot make a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| What time is it in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| All the meetings will take place in the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| So the 11.30 through the 6 o'clock meetings, all of those are open to anybody that wants to attend them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| I mean, like the one that says 1.30, classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| any classified employees that want to come can come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| And for anybody, if people want to go to multiple ones, they can as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| These are, again, it's segmented out like that because she said that usually themes come out of the same like-minded people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| within the group, so it just made it easy to break it down like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| But people are welcome to come to all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Would it make more sense to switch the 1.30 and 3 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| do classified employees at 3 o'clock and central office supervisors and principals at 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| Because at least that would possibly, you know, classified employees at an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| at least may have an opportunity to attend one, but at 1.30 it's going to be really hard for them to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| Was there any thought from the committee as to why the schedule was in this order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| Ms. Baum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Actually, because I have worked in the system, I asked that question and I was concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| and Ms. Grissom said that actually this is when they normally do the classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| and it in the past has been the best attended of all of the meetings that were held that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| So I think she did bump it up maybe or drop it down 30 minutes one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| But her experience has been that the classified staff are the best attended meetings at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| And do we have a location on these meetings yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| So I have been in contact with Knox County and the public's work building on Baxter Avenue has a large space for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| so that they're willing to accommodate us and keep the building open longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| That way it's centrally located to all areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And I believe it's on a bus line, is that correct, too, so that way people can utilize that transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Is there plenty of parking, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Just a comment in reference to what you were talking about as far as classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| and when it would be best to get them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And this certainly is not meant to belittle anybody by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3542)|
| 0:59:13| but it's just human nature that I think if you had them come while they were basically on the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3553)|
| 0:59:23| rather than, you know, close to the time they were going to get off from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| well, they, you know, a lot of people would think, well, I'm tired from the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| I'm going to go on home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| There will be other people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| But I guess what I'm saying is that if you had it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| then you would get better attendance in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| Ms. Bam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Yeah, this might be a question for Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| With the classified employees, how are we working with the schools to be able to allow them to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| Is there a plan to be able to let that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| Because I'm sure that will come up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| No, there's not one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I just saw this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| But we'll make it available for folks to attend that want to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| We'll work that out so that there's no problem work-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| I'm concerned that the letter really doesn't make it clear what the process is at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| So it's the letter that's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| Okay, so what recommendations do you have to add in the language to make it clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I think I would start over because it just really says that it says when these things are taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| Can you tell us which one you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Forum invitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Yes, proposed forum invitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| It says when these are, but this one looks like this is just the community invitation from 6 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3665)|
| 1:01:15| And it's not really clear that they could come to one of those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| I think our staff is going to be very confused about when they are to be where if they want to give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| So if you go down to the second one that's on the list, it gives a sample invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| And I'm open to whatever recommendation, and I would like for us to make that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| So whatever you think to clean it up, let's clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| If we're going to get specific about it, the location is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| It also doesn't say that they could come to a different one if it was more convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| So if that could be cleared up, that would probably help quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| I agree that we need to be more specific about this is the suggested time because it will be more geared to those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| but they are welcome to come at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| And I guess for our employees, like classified employees, if they are going to have to get off work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| I feel like there need to be some instructions going out at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| I guess it's the 130 people that are the biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Central office, I guess, is a little bit different, probably worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| But especially for that 130 time, I think if we're going to put it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| there have to be instructions on how they would actually go about being able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| I'll accept those changes or those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Are we good there, Terri?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Should I state the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| Should I state the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3778)|
| 1:03:08| I move that we accept the proposed community meeting with the recommended changes in the invitations for the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3788)|
| 1:03:25| I have a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| Or Ms. Satterfield made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| And Ms. Henderson really needs to second it because she's been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| So she's okay with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Ms. Satterfield made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Ms. Bounds has seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| So are we done with discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| The first time Ms. Satterfield made the motion, Ms. Horn seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| Oh, I did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| I thought Ms. Henderson did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Ms. Satterfield made a motion to approve the recommended meeting schedule and Ms. Horn seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| So I need to accept these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| So, yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| I thought Ms. Satterfield, I mean Ms. Henderson did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| So sorry, my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Okay, so we have the motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| It's a friendly substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Friendly substitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| So sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Okay, so any discussion on the substitute motion to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Not really about that, but looking at the timeline, now, we'll attend these meetings, at least one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3870)|
| 1:04:43| and we're going to take that information as well as other information and opinions of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3883)|
| 1:04:54| and on December the 8th, we're going to use all that to adopt the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| I'm just recommending that we go to the 1130, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Ms. Thelen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| I would like to see some additional community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| However, I'm good with this schedule with TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| So I think under the second motion is where I would discuss some additional meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| but I just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Okay, so any more discussion on this motion by Ms. Satterfield and seconded by Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3938)|
| 1:05:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Yes, Mr. Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Just a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| If students want to participate in this discussion for a new superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| they would go to the 6 o'clock community forum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| If they want to participate in what TSBA has provided, they are open to go to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| They are open to go to whichever one they want to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| but the one that people do not follow within those categories, the public forum one is available for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| But, again, you're open to go to any one that you want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Is there any specific community input provided by TSBA that students can participate in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| One more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Is there any specific way that students can participate through this TSBA program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| There's a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| There's a survey or the meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| And then whatever Board Member Allman is going to present for after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| But within this system and in this process with TSBA, it's the public forum meeting for students and the survey as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| So we are voting on the community meeting schedule with the friendly amendment that you've made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| Ms. Horne has seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| I don't see anyone else with their microphones down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| The second motion I would like to present is that we approve the recommended timeline for the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Moved by Ms. Satterfield, seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| And any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| I would like to see our timeline expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| And I don't have a specific recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| But I would like to see basically instead of adopting the criteria on December 8th, I would like to see that moved out at least a month so that we can provide some time for additional community input and for student meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4057)|
| 1:07:54| I think our goal in looking for a good candidate shouldn't be put in this box of getting someone quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4074)|
| 1:08:06| I'm much more interested in getting someone who really wants to be here and someone we really want than someone who may be applying to be a superintendent wherever and they might take some other position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4086)|
| 1:08:20| If that's where they are, I don't think that's who we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| I think we want someone who wants to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| So I think stretching out this timeline would be very valuable to us in ensuring that we have what we're really looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4109)|
| 1:08:42| Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| I'm in favor of keeping the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| But I thought, help me out, Betsy and Ms. Satterfield, if we weren't going to possibly have other meetings just like towards 1st of January or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4130)|
| 1:09:06| Was I incorrect on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| I mean, I don't see pushing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I think other meetings can be put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| December 8th is just to adopt the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Yes, so December 8th is to adopt the criteria that is very standard, so to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| There's room for more candidates that she can then put on the brochure that goes out to the searches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| So during that time that the brochure is out there, we can have as many meetings as we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| So, like, the criteria is not dependent upon these other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| So the other meetings can be taking place without messing up the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| and that still gives us an indication of what the public wants in a superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| but it doesn't necessarily change the board's criteria or the criteria that comes in through the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4200)|
| 1:10:09| And I think that the additional information that we could potentially get after the 8th is information for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| to make sure that we're looking for those things in the candidates that are presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| So maybe schedule to do whoever or however schedules the meetings in January before the selection of candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4219)|
| 1:10:28| or even in December would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| Ms. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I don't see the stakeholder survey on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Is it starting tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| So that's why if we are changing this, we need to sit here and figure the timeline out for the rest of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| because the website goes live tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Now, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| I just wasn't sure because I wasn't really seeing it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| So the survey will start, and I do think, let me see, does it say on here when the survey starts and when it ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4253)|
| 1:11:02| If it doesn't, I think on this webpage, I think we need to be very specific of when the last date is for people to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4262)|
| 1:11:11| That would be my one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| And this is just a question on the process, and I feel like the three of y'all have talked to Tammy a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| So recruit quality candidates, and then early February it says select candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| Who selects the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| So say we have 100 people apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Who gets it down to the three, or how does that happen, getting it down to the three that we're actually interviewing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| Can y'all speak a little bit more to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| To my understanding, TSBA will bring us three final candidates that the board will then choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| So we won't have any sense of who else has applied besides those three people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| I mean, I think we can look through all of them, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| I mean, we can look through everybody's resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Well, yeah, I guess it's not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Everything's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Well, if I may, she said in the very first time we talked with her when she was on Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| she said that if there were candidates that a board member or a board wanted to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| that weren't in the top three, that we could review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Yeah, you can pull them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| But then how would we be able to move those to potential candidates for all of us to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| I'm kind of wondering, like, and this is going a little bit to what Ms. Owens has talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| and I'm also not trying to push the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| I mean, I actually do want us to move this along, but if we are having more community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| that are going to impact who we're looking for and what we're looking for in a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| that really only lets us look at those three people with those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Because really, it's really only the three that we're really going...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| Mr. DuPort, can you speak to that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Because I think we had a conversation about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Yeah, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| So, the board's in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I mean, even though you have this search firm helping you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| And this happened the last search, as a matter of fact, because there was a certain number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| and I forget whether it was three or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| But, I mean, you know, there were a certain number of finalists, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Yeah, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| I'm just talking pretty to this child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| But once those finalists were brought before the board, you know, one or more board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| decided, hey, we want to elevate, you know, another candidate up to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| That can be done easily, you know, and that just needs to be one board member asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| that be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| And then, you know, at that point, let's say it's five, or in this case it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| three, and you say you wanted a fourth or a fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| That's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| And then the entire board at that time is looking at, say, four or five instead of just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| I mean, I don't really have a problem with saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I just kind of want to understand it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Ms. Foreman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| I'm assuming if we wanted to, we could ask for the top five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| So, you know, we may want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| We may want to say we want to see the top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| So the recommendation for the three only is because we have those full days that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| be of the candidate going around and consuming staff and consuming school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| But we can absolutely do five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| And then we'll have five days of board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| So each candidate, if we do five, each candidate will then come and present to us, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| be five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| So that is a lot if we get five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I almost didn't even know if we could do, we get their top five recommendations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| then as a board, we make the decision which three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| To feel like we have a little bit more ownership of the three that move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| I like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| That might be, would make me feel a little bit better that it's a little broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| You know, there might not be, I've done some searches for other things before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| And I mean, sometimes you don't have five that really get to that top thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| But I think that, you know, I think it would be nice if there are five that are worth considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| that we're not having an outside group make that decision for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| And it could come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| And then we ideally come down to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| And honestly, my thought would be is if we, or as a group having trouble bringing it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| to three, we interview how many we think are really needing to interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| I mean, I don't want to limit us because of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| But I think have the objective of only doing three days of interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| But don't cut somebody out just because of a three-day limit would be kind of my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| That's just something I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Ms. Bounce, I don't know if you or Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I have that one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| But I have a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| And I think that's a good, I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| So just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I think that we should go forward with the timeline that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| I would not be opposed to additional community meetings in January because I think the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| that we're coming up with that we'll vote on in December is not going to vary tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| from the criteria that we had the last time we did a search because it's a very high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| you know, it's a pretty high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| So I think we're looking more from community members for additional comments on characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| and things that are more that we can certainly take into consideration as we look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| So I do think that if we want to schedule additional community meetings, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| that, you know, moving any later in December is going to benefit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| I mean, I think as we have, anytime we have community meetings, we have so few people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| that attend that maybe if there's, if there are additional people who want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| maybe it would be better to offer one in January because it's at a different time rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| than in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| And I think those were my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| And the other thing, too, that I just made a note of that, you know, TSVA is, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| we've hired them so that we can lean on their expertise in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| And if this is the time interims that they are used to working with them within, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| know, I think they've, that's probably tried and tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| So I think we need to trust their timelines and their intervals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| So I think those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Virginia, I'm glad you raised that point because we spent quite a bit of time addressing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| and one of, if you've ever done a search like that or even doing our student rep, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| you'll see a gap like you might have the first ten candidates are really close in scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| and then there's a drop off and then you, you know, wherever, or the top five be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| strong and then there's a natural break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| So we talked to Ms. Grissom about that and she was willing to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| looking at where those breaks occur and the quality of the candidates and certainly bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| five if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| She just said that typically it works better with a top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| But I think we could, and I think she indicated that that would be one of the things they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| So like to your point, if you had five, you're not going to knock one out just because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| asking for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| You know, if there were five that were really close in all of their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| I do think, I mean, and I've never done anything as high level as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| I mean, this obviously will be the most important search I ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| But I do not, because I think it gets very subjective at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| When you get those people that are at the top level and if we just say three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| So I do like having, I don't mind shooting for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| I just want the flexibility of sort of having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| If there are four that are just sort of very even, I don't think we should sort of knock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| one out because we're no inching further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Yeah, and that's what she indicated to us when we met with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| I just appreciate having that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| Just in reference to what was said there about, I don't really have a problem with the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| and you can have all the community meetings that you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| But remember, once you get into this December, the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4795)|
| 1:20:04| you're going to have trouble getting people to come, in my opinion, to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| It's going to be difficult any time you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| But it's more difficult then and, of course, I don't know if this would interfere with anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4815)|
| 1:20:24| that would genuinely want to come and express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| But on Tuesday nights, we'll have high school basketball games all across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| Now, we also have them on Friday, but we're not going to do it on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| You couldn't get anybody on Friday night, practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4841)|
| 1:20:49| I want clarification on a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| We're going to interview the candidates in mid-February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| We're going to select them in early and then interview them in mid-February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| and late February begin, what does that begin second phase of consideration mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Does that mean narrow it to, is that where we're going to narrow it down to a certain number or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| I don't know what that phrase means in reference to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| Yes, that's exactly what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| So that 23rd date is, these are the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Let's start doing the interview up to five, but those three days are during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| We will make that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| That's the time that the board votes on the other candidates, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Okay, and late February at that particular thing, we're going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| One candidate at a time, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Well, I mean, you said one candidate at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| We'll interview them all one at a time and then we'll follow that up with voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| So from my understanding, the 15th, 16th, and 17th is when we will interview them, ask all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| And then on the 23rd, that's when we'll have another meeting to make our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| And so that will be all the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| I guess the candidates could be here, but that will be our discussion on who we will move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| How would you like it to be read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Well, I mean, I just would like to see, I didn't look on that, what you all talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| but I didn't even know it was on there as far as the timeline to the, you know, that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4947)|
| 1:22:41| You said there were two things, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| And the online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| So you're wanting it to explicitly say board takes vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Well, just explain it a little bit more to the public, you know, as to what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| This, it looks really simplistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| It looks like we, you know, to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Now it's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Maybe it's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| So on the bullet point where it says begin Phase 2 of the consideration, clarify that on what that actually means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I mean, you sort of clarified it, but, you know, but do you think the average person in the public out here would understand if they saw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=4995)|
| 1:23:25| I think it should just say board vote on candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| Well, if that's what you're going to do, interview and then the following interviews vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| You know, we don't have to be real deceptive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| We want them to understand, I would hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| And one other thing that I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| It says early March offer contract, mid-March announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| What's that like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| You're going to give them a week to think it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Or how many days are you going to give it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Five days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| I think that's more of the conversation between the search formant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| I mean, we can make our own, but that's the conversation with the search form for the firm and then the candidate to decide when they want to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| I don't expect the candidate at this level to immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Why would it be between the firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| We're the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Yeah, so we can set the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| If you want to say you have to respond in five days, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| This is an opportunity for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| I just want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| And I think we should set the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| So let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Not the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| I mean, not the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| So what date would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| I mean, five days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Well, I would think five days you could decide whether you want a job or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| You want the job or you wouldn't apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Mr. McMillan, do you think it would be acceptable to vote on when we approve that candidate that we could decide when we want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5098)|
| 1:25:10| Could we do it at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| I'm just saying that it looks like it's been left out here kind of in the open, spacey, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| So that's what I would propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| That may just be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| And if it is, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| So Ms. Owen, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| I agree with Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| I would like to see actually on the website some explanation of what everything means so that there is some clarity for the public to understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5135)|
| 1:25:45| If we are not going to consider extending the timeline at all, I would like to see some kind of student forum prior to adopting criteria on December 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5145)|
| 1:25:59| And is that a student forum that you want the board to host, the search committee to host?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5159)|
| 1:26:13| How would you like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I don't think it could be either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| I don't think it matters whether we do it or whether TSBA does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| But I think our students deserve to have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| And so what I'm looking for in this discussion, board members, is if you have suggestions, also have, like, what do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| Because I'm open to whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| But if you can give me the definition, the finite date, what you want, we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5194)|
| 1:26:44| We can't make happen what I want to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| So since that can't happen, it sounds like we are not open to spreading out this calendar at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| So whatever kind of student forum can be put in before adopting the criteria, that's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| So committee members, if you would like to weigh in on what that looks like, because we have the public forum and also the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| So what would that look like from you all's perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Can I ask if this would be a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| I mean, I'm not trying to cut out any students, but I would think it's more of our high school students that are going to have more of an opinion than elementary and middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| I mean, that's my guess as to who we're really seeking out opinions from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| Not that I would want to keep a middle school or elementary school person from doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| Is there a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Because this is the one thing I think about the public forums that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| It's always hard for people to get there and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| But we've got kids at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Is there any way to incorporate at the high school level something at the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| I wonder if that's something that we can let our student rep lead possibly, because to give ownership of the role of that, and we work in tangent with that, and also whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5272)|
| 1:28:01| Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| And maybe with the community meetings that you're working on with KEF, is that maybe a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| Maybe KEF would be willing to help out with that as well, with the student forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| And Mr. Lettos is out there nodding, so that's a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| So, Mr. Raymond, how do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| Yeah, I think that would definitely be a very good idea, to have that direct student input, and let it be clear to those students that, hey, you have this place to provide your opinion and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| Because I do have concern where if you try to mix in what we have right now, in the community forum, where you're mixing students with adults, things like that, honestly, some students might be a little bit intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5310)|
| 1:28:40| They just don't want to speak out in that kind of setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| So it would be very good if we work out some kind of program, maybe at individual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| That would be, I think, probably the best way to get as much student input as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| If we could work something out like that, then that might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Yeah, I feel like we can work, and maybe you can work with Mr. Lettos at Knox Ed Foundation, and maybe come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5334)|
| 1:29:04| You know, I think that's a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| So, Ms. Thorne, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| And I just wanted to point out the importance of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Because TSBA, this is not going to, from my understanding, and you guys that spoke with her about this can correct me, but from my understanding, this is to gather information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5358)|
| 1:29:28| It's not a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| It's not a, I mean, it's just to gather comments and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| So the survey will be available tomorrow is what, November, whatever it is, 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| So until December 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| So that's, you know, people have all that length of time to put those comments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| And it's really, I mean, that's a very effective way of communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Because when you come and you're in person, yes, you'll hear what other people say, which is definitely an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| But those comments that are going to be in the survey are extremely valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| Going through the last search, that's what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| I remember the pages and pages and pages of comments and reading through those and doing what we're asking TSBA to do, which is to look for trends and similar, you know, ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5407)|
| 1:30:21| So I think that we need to, I just don't think we need to negate the importance of that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| We will get thousands of responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| We will get many, many more responses to the survey than we will ever get with people coming in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| So I just want everybody to understand how important this survey is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| I mean, this is going to be, this is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| And being there in person, your voice is not going to be heard any more than the surveys that we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5446)|
| 1:30:57| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| And speaking to that and back to Ms. Babb's point, then on this superintendent search timeline, which I'm fine with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| can we add there that survey will be sent out on such as, well, tomorrow, and then put the date when the superintendent survey closes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5466)|
| 1:31:17| Because I think that would be helpful to have on this timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I think, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| So in the, when I'm gathering, and so Carly will, there she goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| Hey, Carly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| So the input would be to clarify what this timeline means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| I'm also connecting Carly with Tammy Grissom to have more one-on-one communication so that she will be able to tell her directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| And so before it is live, because what I'm not wanting is that it goes live and we have to come back and change and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5502)|
| 1:31:49| So before it's live, please get all of your, what you need and how you want it, because once it's live, that's what we're rolling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| So Carly will clarify all of these components as much as possible so that it can be common language to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| That was suggested from Mr. Mike in Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| And then Raymond will take ownership of the student community, the student input conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5527)|
| 1:32:17| So we're leaving that to you, Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| One of them is very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| I know at the last meeting I had on the dates that we were going to do the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| And then tonight is, maybe we talked about it last week, but I didn't hear it last week, the date that we were actually going to do the voting, which is February 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| And I actually am getting on a plane that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| I didn't know if there's any way we could do it on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| I would really like to be a part of that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| That's just a personal request for me, if we could consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| I wouldn't have made my flight if I had known at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| So if we could consider that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| On the survey, can we just make sure it's offered in Spanish and translated in Spanish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| I just want to make sure that we are offering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| And then I guess this is maybe to Ms. Owens' comments, asking her, so do you feel like what we're talking about with the students makes you feel better about public meetings, or do you even want more public meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5590)|
| 1:33:23| I just want a little bit more clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| And then if we want more public meetings besides just the student ones we've talked about, I do think we need to give ownership to someone to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5605)|
| 1:33:34| Otherwise, it's just kind of out there and nobody will take ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| So just a little bit more specifics from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| The feeling that I'm getting from community members is that they want to feel that they have had an opportunity to give their input, and they want to do that in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5620)|
| 1:33:54| So that is where that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| I think my concern is having input prior to adopting the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| Because if we find out that there is something, some particular thing that is very important to students, but we don't find that out until after we've adopted that criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5647)|
| 1:34:18| sure, we can use that in narrowing our candidates, but we've not put it out as our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| So I think if we are looking for genuine input from the community, we need to get that prior to making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5665)|
| 1:34:44| So could we add a date in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| Well, I don't guess we can add a date before tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| But have that, I mean, before school breaks for the semester, have the student get together with and decide a time and a location and get the information out to the students to have that before the, well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5691)|
| 1:35:15| There's just a very small window there. December, I was looking after the 8th, but if Ms. Owen wants it before we adopt the criteria, it would have to almost be the first week of December or the last week in November for the student meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5715)|
| 1:35:33| Is that doable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| Mr. Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| I think if we can move fast enough, I think that is definitely doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| I guess my concern would be if we did move that fast, there is a possibility that some information might not get out there to where students know that this is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5742)|
| 1:35:51| So if they don't know about it, then they're not going to be able to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| So that would be one concern I would have if we did hold those meetings in November or beginning of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| But I think it's doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Okay, so if you look at the next item, the job description that we used the last time we did a search is listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| So my question is, when we adopt what we're going to adopt on December 8th, what exactly are we expecting to adopt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5773)|
| 1:36:24| Because this document has the job summary, the essential functions, the duties and responsibilities, which I wouldn't think any of those would be different than what we were looking for prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5784)|
| 1:36:39| I mean, there may be some tweak, but those are expectations of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| And then it lists education and experience requirements, which the last time we had this discussion, that was really the big thing, was the education and experience requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5805)|
| 1:36:55| Those were the things that we had some conversation around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| So in addition to this type document, what is it that we are expecting to approve on the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5820)|
| 1:37:09| So we probably would approve all of that same, unless there's a lot of information that says we want somebody with a higher education, like a terminal degree, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5829)|
| 1:37:21| Unless that's a robust information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Also on the 8th, she's coming to report out what she gathered from the community meetings and the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| So it's going to be a full report with the adoption criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| I don't imagine, unless somebody is really passionate about that, or we get a lot of input that says their criteria is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| Because our criteria is aligned with what the state requires, and it's also very vague to make sure that we are able to get as many candidates as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5859)|
| 1:37:50| Right. So I guess my question is, what do we expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| I'm not sure what else we're going to, how we would, because when you put an advertisement out to, you know, with a national firm, you're going to have this exact kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5873)|
| 1:38:07| So I'm just not sure what else we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| I think that we will get personal type characteristic comments from community members, and I think that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| We certainly want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| But I'm just asking for December 8th, for the purposes of TSBA, having something that they can then use to create a brochure, which, you know, that would include information about, you know, Knox County even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5901)|
| 1:38:36| But what, you know, what else would be in the documentation that TSBA is going to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| So do you understand my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Like, I'm just not sure that, I think what we want, we can continue to gather past that date in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5924)|
| 1:38:55| Yeah. I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| And I think that that will not push the student meeting, because I think that that's the whole end goal, is to be able to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| And it's got to be broad to get the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| So you can't get in the weeds that you want somebody with brown hair and blue eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| I mean, you've just got to do a general criteria, and then the meetings that follow up can become more personal characteristics of what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5953)|
| 1:39:25| So I agree with you. I think just leave it like it is and have those work with KEF and have those after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5965)|
| 1:39:34| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| And Ms. Warren, I agree that the job description may not change, but what you said about those feelings from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5977)|
| 1:39:48| if we are gathering that, but TSBA is making the selection, then there's a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| Because that gives us information that they don't have when they are looking at those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| And there's nowhere in here where we have an opportunity to share that information with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| It's my understanding that the only information that they are taking in for their selection of candidates is information that they gather up until December 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6009)|
| 1:40:20| So, you know, if they are not involved in any of that, sure, we can use that when we get down to those last few candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6020)|
| 1:40:29| but they can't use it in determining those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Well, I mean, I think that we can certainly give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| If they are selecting candidates on February 9th, if we've had meetings the month of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| that information can be compiled and shared with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Why don't we add that to the calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Yeah, let's just add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| I think we need to decide when we want to have any community meetings done by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| and by that date, which needs to be in enough time for TSBA to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| I mean, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| I think we want TSBA considering these same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| So I think we just need to look in the timeline and put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| Would that help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Yeah, I think that's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| I have a question about that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| So you're indicating that we host the community meeting as the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| KEF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| KEF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| So I also want us to also really think bigger and also have an opportunity to include the community on stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6081)|
| 1:41:31| And so community has the opportunity to organize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| and there's organizations out there that they can take the input and create their own meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| and say this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| I don't think that it should be us organizing because we add a layer of dynamics to situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| And so this could be under KEF, community meetings, if they agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| So I'm okay with that, but I don't think it should be our community meeting that we hold as board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| I think we need some clarity on how that information gets from that community meeting to us and to TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| So from the community meeting that we're putting in place after the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| Any community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| If other groups are holding meetings and that's the way we want that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| then what guarantees that their input goes anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| How do they get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| They need to know how to deliver that information to us or to TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| and there's nothing here to indicate when or how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| So she did share that she's willing to give email address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| and anybody can call and do what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| So that's something we can add on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| If you want to give your input, send it straight to Tammy Grissom from Tennessee School Board Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| Is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I'm looking for an answer, a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Well, sure, but they need some kind of timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I mean, we can't just tell community people, go have your meeting and let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| because that doesn't give them enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| So they need some kind of timeline for when and how to deliver that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| In reference to what you all were saying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| it's fine to get community input, and we should by all means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| but some people don't really want to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| They look to, we elected a school board, that's what you're elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| You approach it and find the best person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| As a collective group, you all find the best person, and we'll have to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6222)|
| 1:43:51| There's all sorts of different views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| and I hope we don't get so many different things that we start to conflict with certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6235)|
| 1:44:06| What I wanted to ask was, and I don't know that anybody could answer it necessarily at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6246)|
| 1:44:17| but when we're considering these candidates, anybody can apply no matter where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6257)|
| 1:44:28| And we're going to have, I guess, based on the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| we're going to have a little over 100 days at least between the time the person accepts the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6274)|
| 1:44:48| and the time they actually, Bob retires and they actually take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6288)|
| 1:44:58| Do we want to, or is it important that no matter where they're from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| that they understand East Tennessee values, or does that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| I think that's something you can put in the, so in the plan that we purchased with TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| she's going to be able to talk to each individual board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| and so if that's the desire of yours, that's something you can lift up for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| Well, it is of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| I don't care if they're from Alaska or wherever they're from, Minnesota or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6324)|
| 1:45:35| I would hope that if they don't know much about the values of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| Knoxville, and surrounding East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| that they would make every attempt to familiarize themselves with it during that brief period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6347)|
| 1:45:56| I think the taxpayers and the people, parents and stuff, would expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6356)|
| 1:46:07| I really believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| No matter what the kids and students, I should say, no matter what they think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| I don't know that they would disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| And I'm just saying that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| But I just don't want to get too many people, I mean, it's fine for everybody to have their say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6386)|
| 1:46:34| and we can have people speaking other languages and stuff in the surveys and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| but the bottom line is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| we are here to select the person who we think, as a collective group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6406)|
| 1:46:55| will do the best job to serve our kids in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I think I have two ideas that may alleviate this community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| I think one is having a deadline in the timeline for community input that's separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| so like all community input is due by whatever date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| On what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| January 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| And then KEF could produce a memo to the board and TSBA of the main community points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| So that way it wraps it up and it's cohesive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| If that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| Ms. Thorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| So question about the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Is the survey, are the survey results going directly, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| will they then go to TSBA for them to tabulate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| So then they're going to need those by, before that December 8th meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| Yeah, so the survey will close on December 2nd so that she can report back from what the community says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| So that could be a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| Do we want to extend the survey portion to that January 15th date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| I mean, I think that we have to, I think that for TSBA's purposes, it needs to close on December 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6490)|
| 1:48:19| So I think if we do anything else, it has to be in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| And so the meetings that, if we accept, if we go with what Board Member Henderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| the information that comes from those meetings will be used as our guide, as board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| to say this is what they're also continuing to tell us what we're looking for in candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| Yeah, like kind of secondary information, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| From the same survey, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| I mean, to, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| Just any other board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| I mean meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| Or any other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Meetings, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| Yeah, I think we need to keep our timeline for the survey and the community meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| And if we can, if there's a way to get the student meetings at the different schools, I mean, I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| Because, I mean, I don't think any of us want to not hear from the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| I think it's just logistically, and I do like the idea of doing it at the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| because I think it would really get the kids to show up versus all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| I mean, I have to say, the kids that are probably most opinionated and have the most thoughts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| are your active kids that are really busy after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| So, you know, I think if you can capture them while they're at school, I think that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| So, I think we need to keep the December 2nd thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| but I do think we all need to personally work at trying to encourage people to fill it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| putting it like on our social media, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| I would hope that all the schools, like our principals in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| I know they all send out memos to parents and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| I hope that all of our principals are encouraged to put the link for the survey in their messaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| because that's, I think, really how you're going to get out to the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| And, I mean, while I want to hear from community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| it's really parents that I think are going to care most and have the most opinions about their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| besides actual school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| I mean, I think staff will, and I think they're a community that we're able to easily communicate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| to get them to take the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| But I think we talked about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| If we put the information out there, people have ample time to get a survey done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Just giving them two more weeks to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| I don't think it's going to get the people that really care about taking it to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| I think it's just getting the information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| One other thing, and this is just kind of a minutiae thing, kind of on our timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| and this is probably a Carly Harrington thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| but if we can just put specific dates on it and then also check off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| or kind of change them to a different color or something as we have finished those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| that kind of thing, so that people realize that we have actually moved along in our timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| I think would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| Okay, restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I have all the friendly emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| State change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Well, I have it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| We'll all listen and see if you capture it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Hopefully I captured everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| Carly, I hope you took really good notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| I make a motion to approve the timeline with the additional recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Timeline clarification on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Additional student-focused input meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| And phase two consideration moved from February 23rd to February 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6684)|
| 1:51:33| And Ms. Babb, you had seconded the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| Did we need to add that January 15th deadline that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| So that was part of the timeline clarification on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| so all the additional notes and stuff will be on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| and I'll communicate with Carly on those dates and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| I will second the friendly amendment motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| Ms. Babb, is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6719)|
| 1:52:06| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| All right, Madam Chair, I have one more in this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| All right, so at the board retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| we talked about getting a board to have a superintendent evaluation done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| And so at our previous meetings we have voted for $11,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| but if we want to get the additional superintendent evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| this is a superintendent evaluation that TSBA will provide to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| We will need to increase that by $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| So I make the motion that we increase our payments to TSBA to $13,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| and any costs accrued by the candidates' visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| What was the last part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Costs accrued by the candidates' visits when they come into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6787)|
| 1:53:20| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| I would like to keep the evaluation process separate from the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| I feel like that just kind of muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| So I'd be happy to look at the expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| but I think it would be better to look at the evaluation separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| I can accept that, but I want to see if anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| I just know that that's what we discussed at the board retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| and I agree with that rationale as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| The only thing that I could think of is that it might be helpful for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| superintendent or the people that are candidates that are considered coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| to our system if they know kind of what they're going to be evaluated on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| So I don't think we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| I mean, it's not like we're going to be doing the superintendent search in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| the middle of the candidate search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| but I do think it is very helpful because we rushed really hard to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| get the other one done so that Superintendent Thomas would have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| information before accepting the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| So I think it's kind of crucial for them to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| I think that's how what that discussion centered around was the candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| knowing how that would be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Yeah, I just, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I think that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| I would be in favor of approving that $1,500 so that we can go ahead and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| that rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| And if we maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| maybe change the motion so that it's two different motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| but I definitely think we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I would be in favor of going forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| I agree that it would be helpful for the candidates to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| My concern is really that we haven't seen what kind of evaluation they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| And if it looks anything like our board self evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| that's concerning to me because that's so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| so vague and difficult to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| And if we're going to end up with something vague and difficult to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| with without knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I agree that it should be there before the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| the candidates should know how they're going to be evaluated in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| but I have concerns about the evaluations that I've seen from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6943)|
| 1:55:51| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| I spoke with Tammy Grissom today to ask her specifically about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| And she explained to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| she's been working with Rutherford County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| I think most recently on their evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| the way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| and I haven't seen it in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| but just in her explaining it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| there are three sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| The first one is basically getting feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| I don't know if it's in a form of a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| but some sort of feedback from school principals and central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| So something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| something in that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| The second part was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| I can't remember exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| but the third part I remember specifically was directly tied to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| So she explained it as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| basically a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| So she actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| they had taken Rutherford County's strategic plan and tied specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| initiatives for that year into the evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| So basically every year you're looking at what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| what will be the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| what will be the things that you are addressing this year from your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| strategic plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| So it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| it sounds very different than what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| The middle section I think is probably maybe along the same lines as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| ours would look like or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| or part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| I don't remember exactly what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| but that the third piece was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| was quite different than what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| So I don't know if that helps anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| so just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| this would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| approving this would permit TSBA to develop or work with us to develop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| superintendent evaluation model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| but that is something the board would still have to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| So if we did not like the end result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| you would still have a vote or say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| and whether that was approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Do we have a timeline for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| no timeline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| And I know what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| like we'll still have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| And I know a desire that was brought up at the board retreat was also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| include a 360 survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| So that will be something that we as a board can put into the evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| They're just giving us the framework for $1,500 because the framework that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| we have needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| we need a new framework in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| And so that's more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| but there's no timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| But I think if it's going to be included in something for our candidates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| then it needs some kind of timeline to be sure that we have it in time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Would you like to make a timeline recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| How would you like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| Tammy to give the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| that can be often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| I'd like Tammy to let us know when it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| I would think looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| at least by the beginning of February and really maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| because if we're going to have to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| I don't know if we're going to have to have a special called meeting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| it or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| but when you start looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| if you look at when they're selecting candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| we want them to be able to have something before they come in for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| And when you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| which is mid February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| that's where I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| I'm just concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| And maybe somebody needs to be in charge of talking to Tammy just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| what they are capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| Because to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| we almost need something to us in January to almost have only maybe even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| special called meeting about it to be able to have them be able to give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| to the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| I'm just trying to look at the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| I think from based on the fact that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| this is also something that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| they do regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| they're going to have a framework that they would customize for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| I wouldn't think that would be very time consuming for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| So I would think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| by early February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| just guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| it seems like they'd be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| That's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| that's the whole month of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| the whole month of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| it seems like that would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I just want us to keep in mind that board self evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| Cause that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Do we need to separate out the travel expenses and approve that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| You kind of added it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| but that's kind of a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| it was part of our motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| So Miss Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| would you like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| do you want to separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| do you want separate or do you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| The travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| I guess I was concerned if she was trying to move the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| evaluation out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| the travel expenses definitely goes with the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| that definitely fits with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| If it's more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| if we're moving a different motion for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| I really don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7251)|
| 2:01:00| So if there's no substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| I'll go with the motion that was presented earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| I move that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| purchase the superintendent evaluation tool at the cost of $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| and any additional travel costs for candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| So we have a motion by Miss Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| and I believe Miss Bounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| did you second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| So with no other discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| all in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7295)|
| 2:01:44| I'm 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| I discussion possible action on Knox County Board of Education policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| See one 21 director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| qualifications and selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| So motion by Miss Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| a second by Miss Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Do we have any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| Miss, Miss Warren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| what exactly would we be voting on just to accept like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| I guess we actually probably could remove it from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| could have been removed from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| if anybody had anything that they wanted to change and nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| it was just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| it was on there last week in case we did want to make any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| but no changes were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7342)|
| 2:02:30| So we don't even have to take an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| So moving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| Adam 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| Jay consideration of a resolution proposing a survey for potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7356)|

| 2:04:36| A concern last week was that parents will assume with a survey that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| will be implemented regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7480)|

| 2:05:14| thrown into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| This is a nonpartisan board and I ask that you find compromise in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7516)|
| 2:05:24| to help our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| Another concern was cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| As of November 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| there were 31 unfulfilled educational assistant positions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| This gives the board roughly $580,000 of unused salary to make program and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| programs available for the students interested in a hybrid or a high risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7541)|

| 2:05:49| Additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| the unused salary could be used as hiring incentives to fill some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| empty positions that are so desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7555)|

| 2:06:01| clearly going nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| send a well-researched proposal that gets all students back into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7564)|

| 2:06:12| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| please do this for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| This is what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| That concludes public forum for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7586)|

| 2:06:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7606)|

| 2:06:50| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| I just wanted to address a little bit more since there seems to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| little bit misunderstanding about this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| I know one question that I got last week was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| is this legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| I'm doing something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| is breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| And I just wanted to put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| The law department was kind enough to come up with a memo that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| circulated to everybody earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| And I just wanted to read the first couple sentences of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| The issue presented whether setting up alternative learning sites for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| virtual students with the medical condition that places them at higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| risk of complications from COVID-19 violates IDEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| ADA 504 or other related laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| So long as KCS provides an environment that is staffed appropriately and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| allows for an equal or greater number of students without disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| to utilize the alternative learning locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| which is all set up in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| at the end of the day we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| the judge has said we have a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| So we have in-person and we have virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| And he's saying we have this gap and his solution right now is to mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| When we need to be working on ways to fill that hole and fill that hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| for our 60,000 students right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| This is just asking for a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| It asks the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| who's interested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| It costs $0 from KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| It helps come up with a plan and it's something that we can bring back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| The law department has gone back multiple times to remove this order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| but the board has taken no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| We haven't brought any resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| We haven't tried to fix any of our programs to alleviate this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| Meanwhile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| other large districts that are more diverse are lifting their mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| Broward County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Florida is lifting theirs on November 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Hamilton County lifted theirs on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| So I'm just trying to find a solution to take back to the judge that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| help alleviate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| So our kids aren't in mass for at least the rest of the school year or into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7729)|

| 2:09:04| Henderson today and the communication from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| which was very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7748)|

| 2:09:28| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| the concern that I have is one that we'll have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| we would have to then look at if we decide we want to get forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| And that's what the speaker mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| the lack of educational assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| That's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| that's not good that we have all these vacancies because those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| actually the folks who would be doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| That's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| the funding would go to educational assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| which is what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| we are lacking already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| So that's my concern is how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| how that would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| But at the stage we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| what you're asking for is a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| which as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| cost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| I'm willing to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| I think that it'll be interesting to see what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| what we get back from that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| So I intend to support it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| I feel like it's very disingenuous and unfair to our parents for us as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| board to send out a survey for a program that we know cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7825)|
| 2:10:32| implemented in a timeline that would make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| It makes those parents think that this is something that can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| within this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| When we all know that there's no portable classroom that can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| suddenly go up and certainly not within the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| even looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| at the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| it's not in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| We need to figure out where that money's going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| but that's not even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| that's not even relevant because we're asking parents to tell us whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| they want to do something that we know we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| And that's just not fair to those parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| And I'd like to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Oaks again to tell us how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| what kind of timeline is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| anybody can tell us what kind of timeline would it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| Even for one portable classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| What would it take for us to determine the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| have that site cleared and put in that portable classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| What's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| what would be the timeline for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| The biggest issue that we're facing right now is the actual availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| of the building units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| We have two that are scheduled to be installed at Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| They were ordered in the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| They're not scheduled to arrive on site until the first week of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| And so the biggest issue that we have from a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| from a constraint is being able to get our hands on available buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| We don't have portable sitting right now that are not being used because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| that's what we were looking at was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| did we have ones that we could relocate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| There are none in the system that aren't being currently utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| So if we put out this survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| got all our survey results back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| came back to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| got Mr. McPherson to figure out where and how we're going to pay for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| and then ordered them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| we're looking at the end of the school year before we would even have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| buildings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| I believe that's true state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| So if this appeal in the sixth circuit fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| we're looking into next year being still amassed according to judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| So I don't think it's unreasonable to at least pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| I know you've referred to learning cottage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| but last week or last week after the board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| I talked to Mr. Oaks about the availability of space within some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| And there's not a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| but there is some space available in some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| So depending on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| depending on the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| if there were not a tremendous amount of people that indicated they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| we might could use that available space that's in the schools with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| separate entrances for these kids to be able to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| So I don't think we shut it down just because we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| my school had my district leads in the number of learning cottages in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| So I'm very familiar with how much they cost and how many there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| but I don't think we can just not do the survey because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Because like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| if the sixth circuit denies this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| then it could be spring of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| And we certainly would have time to get cottages in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| But in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| we might could utilize some of the space in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| according to Mr. Oaks and my conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| we may be talking about 20 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| I've talked to some experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| They're saying maybe 25 kids if it's 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| it's not doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| but it's worth trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| Haven't seen any other solutions come to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| Are you talking about moving all of those 25 children to one place from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| the whole County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| We're going to see what the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| this is just for a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| which costs nothing to see what information we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| And it's another tool that we can have in our tool belt to take back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| to show him that we are trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| And we see his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| the issues that he has with the program currently not being ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| and how we're trying to elevate that to make it ADA compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| according to his order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| This may be in the information and I may be forgetting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| The survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| does it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| it does include what school the student is zoned for or attends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Because I think that would be important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| So if it's not in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| let's make sure it's in there so that we know when we're getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| it can be an anonymous response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| but it definitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| we would need to know as far as zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| So I have a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| So is this a survey that would be going out to all students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| It would be going out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| So that way we can see who's medically fragile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| but it's also for everybody who is uncomfortable and wants to still be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| a mass situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| And we have to open it up according to law to everybody as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| So the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| the survey would be designed to gauge interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| and like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| you're looking for the medically fragile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| but because there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| there does have to be a general education component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| It certainly makes sense to open it up to see who would be actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| And we had talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| Dupler and I've had so many conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| tell me if I'm incorrect in my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| When we talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| it would give priority to those who are medically fragile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| since that is in Judge Greer's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| And then it would open up almost to a lottery system to those other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| equal amount of spots to the general education population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| it would be carried out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| but the thought is that it would at least be similar in some aspects to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| the voluntary preschool program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| which is carried out in the way that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| There's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| there's the special ed component and then the general ed component is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| more of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| more of the lottery due to the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8242)|
| 2:17:31| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| if the administration had a chance to consider where they would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| those education assistance from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| would they come from the zoned school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| What program would lose the assistance that we have to cover those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| I think what we'd need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8271)|
| 2:17:52| is to get the survey back and then make that determination once we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| how many people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| there's space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| High school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| maybe there's space at Holston middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| are you aware of additional space at any of our facilities other than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8286)|
| 2:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| But it just depends on how many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| we'll do whatever the board votes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| We'll make sure we implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| Will there be anything on the survey asking how far parents are willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| allow their students to travel to be able to be a part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8311)|
| 2:18:38| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| I think we could include that in the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8319)|
| 2:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Is there any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| And I'm fine with the survey in asking parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| I just would want to make sure that we are very careful in how it's worded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| because I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| if there's a large response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| it probably isn't going to be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| my big concerns from the staffing side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| because we are struggling to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| we have vacant positions now throughout the district that we're struggling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| So this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| that that's where my big concerns are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| I completely understand those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| And I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| it's kind of twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| It's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| can we do this if it is manageable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| it's a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| but it's also a tool to bring back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| whether it's Judge Greer or the appellate court of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| here's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Right now we're doing nothing and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| we don't really have anything to bring to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| So it's another piece of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| here's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| We heard you and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| we're trying to figure out a solution from the board and in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8406)|
| 2:20:12| I would just want to be very clear when the survey went out that it is just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| gauge interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| there might not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| we may not have the resources or even the staffing to do it so that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| weren't any expectations that it was going to happen because we sent out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| It should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| the message that this is to gauge interest for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8445)|
| 2:20:53| Ms. Henderson made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| And Ms. Horn seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| So we probably need to do a roll call vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| That's four yes votes, three no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| Ms. Satterfield, did you want to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Four yes votes, four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| So the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| It doesn't have to have a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| Oh, you have to have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| Sorry, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| It was a second of glimmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| Yeah, okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| So the motion fails, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| So we will move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8516)|
| 2:21:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| We have four people sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| First we have Jennifer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Jennifer Taylor, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Following Judge Greer's decision, I found myself at a protest for the first time in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| fighting for my rights as a parent and for the freedom of choice for my daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| There I met an amazing group of parents who want nothing more than to defend the freedoms outlined in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| We didn't know each other and were from all types of backgrounds, but none of that mattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| What mattered was our common goal, not anti-mask, but pro-freedom of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| That means both the freedom for your child to wear a mask as well as the freedom of my child to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| Every parent should be able to make that choice with their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| Unfortunately, there are some on the other side that don't feel the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| who believe that peaceful protests where we carry American flags and signs against mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| and walk our children to school shouldn't be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| who believe a group of parents and children who move to the side of the walkway to say the Pledge of Allegiance is intimidating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| who, when told by school resource officers we are doing nothing wrong, decide to find another way to attack and get rid of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| That attack came in social media, a place built for lies and bullying, a place that can destroy lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| As you all know, anything goes on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| One person can post a photo and say whatever they want about that photo, despite knowing what they're writing is a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| And others will take that story and run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| And that's just what happened last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| As a protest group, we all carry our phones and take videos during protests to document what we're doing for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| how our kids are treated when they enter the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| and the harmful actions of those on the other side which have yet to be reported in any news stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| In this instance, a photo was taken of a member of our group as he dropped off his child at Farragut Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| and was posted to Twitter by someone who knows he has a child at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| What do you think happened to that post?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Social media took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Someone responded calling him a pedophile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Then that got pushed along to others with comments just as outrageous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| to include someone posting a quote they received from a board member sitting here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| So not only are complete strangers who know nothing about this man commenting that he is a pedophile, a pervert, and a predator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8654)|
| 2:24:21| after he just dropped his child at school, but now we have a school board member weighing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| Well, that man, I happen to know personally that he has raised two beautiful, strong, intelligent, and independent girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| because he's been my husband for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| Do you think he deserved what happened to him on social media because he was fighting for their freedom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| Do you think our kids deserve to have their dad called a predator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| Do you think a board member should have weighed in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| This hatred and vitriol from the other side has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| We're not against those who choose to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| And despite lies in multiple news stories, we treat everyone who walks by us with respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| both masked and unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| But we won't be intimidated into stopping our fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| So to any media here tonight, who's more intimidating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| a group of concerned parents walking to school together with their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| or those on the other side who curse at us in front of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| give us the finger as they drive by and attack an innocent man on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| Next we have Hannah Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Hannah, you all have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8726)|
| 2:25:34| My name is Hannah Taylor, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| First, I would like to thank those of you on the school board who have fought for our rights in regards to masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| and tried to tonight pass programs that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| It is reassuring and inspiring to know that some of you are fighting for students and parents to make their own medical decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| and not have them forced on us by the government or a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| Currently, there are 62 active cases of COVID-19 among students and staff in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| That is just 0.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| In the United States, in the last two years, only 474 school-age children have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| Obviously, that is not a good number, but thankfully in Knox County there has been zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| Meanwhile, there is a bigger problem that has been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| Depression and anxiety in kids grew by 50% during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| There are over 2,000 suicides a year in the U.S. in kids under 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8786)|
| 2:26:31| And in 2020, the suicide attempts by teen girls increased by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| In 2020, the CDC director said that there has been another cost that we have seen, particularly in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8797)|
| 2:26:44| We are seeing, sadly, far greater suicides now than we are deaths from COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8804)|
| 2:26:50| I know from personal experience that isolation, segregation, masks, lost education, and threats of mandatory vaccines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8810)|
| 2:26:57| has hurt children far more than COVID has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| I've heard from teachers, principals, and from some school board members that you can't do anything about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| because you will be in contempt of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| To me, that's fancy for saying that you're afraid of consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| You can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| You can stand up and do what is right for the most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| History has made something clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| Change is not made by compliant people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| Thank God for Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Change is not made by weak people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Thank God for Abraham Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| We aren't asking you to stand up for something radical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| We are asking you to stand up for freedom, for the choice to wear a mask or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| I've heard so many times that it's just a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| It is government overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| And if we don't fight now, we are setting a precedent and making it easier for the government to continue to push us around in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| We have a good example right here in Knox County where Sheriff Tom Spangler wrote President Biden a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| refusing to comply with the enforcement of a vaccine mandate, telling him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| I will not comply with this unconstitutional order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| Sheriff Spangler defied the President of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| Surely you can defy a judge for the health and education of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| Will you stand up or will you make parents, teachers, and children like me do it for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8885)|
| 2:28:11| As Sheriff Spangler closed his letter, we are still the land of the free because of the brave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8891)|
| 2:28:16| Please be brave as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| Next we have William Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| William Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| William, you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| My name is William Taylor, and I'm here from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| I'm here tonight to expose some of the lies and show you what the media hasn't really showed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| You may have seen this photo posted on the Internet, the one my wife referred to a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| This is a picture of me that was posted on Twitter, and I'm not a social media person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| but this is what was posted by an activist parent who spoke at the board last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| Attached to that tweet, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| Why are we allowing this man to video children outside FMS student entrance while they walk into school at drop-off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8937)|
| 2:29:05| She claims, I don't have any students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| There's my two daughters right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| This picture was taken outside the school as we walked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| and this parent who claims that their children are so intimidated and can't be around these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| well, this parent is videoing us constantly out there with her child behind her the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8962)|
| 2:29:32| Her child is so intimidated that she spoke to the board last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| So we say the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8975)|
| 2:29:44| She posts this picture of us, according to her, blocking the entrances to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| Farragut Intermediate School in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| and she goes right up behind somebody to take a picture to make it look like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| Well, this is the actual picture of what it looks like when we were saying the Pledge of Allegiance out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| There's plenty of room for people to walk by, and people were clearly walking by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| But what you'll also see here is a picture out front of Farragut Intermediate with her once again taking video and picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| getting up in our face and taking pictures with her daughter, who does not go to Farragut Intermediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| who's so afraid and intimidated by everybody that she's parading through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| So the lie that she posted prompted a firestorm, as my wife mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| Here are some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| This is only a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Is this a pedophile you are allowing to video our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| Why hasn't this potential predator been identified and questioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| We may need federal help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| Can we give the students water guns filled with urine for, you know, self-defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| Arrest that pervert from taking pics of those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| And the poster, the original one that posted it, the parent activist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| she went on and liked every single one of those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| This is the one that's getting quoted in the newspaper, Knox News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| Lastly, someone, as my wife mentioned on the board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| had chimed in and weighed in, too, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| if someone can get a video of him and show exactly how long he's there, I can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9068)|
| 2:31:17| Well, Ms. Owen, here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| What something were you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| Mr. Dupler, since I've been called out, may I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| A board member is allowed to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9093)|
| 2:31:34| What we have been sent over and over are still pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| And we have parents claiming that there are different people there for extended periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9099)|
| 2:31:46| But we have nothing that shows that they are there for extended periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| We only have still pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| And still pictures don't show us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| And so I ask, if you can send us a video, we can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| Well, they haven't sent us a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| And so there is nothing to do because there's nothing that shows that you were there for any extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9126)|
| 2:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| That's comforting to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| I do appreciate that, although I wish you hadn't have weighed in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9141)|
| 2:32:22| Your time has exceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9142)|
