| 2:16:53| and the use, I believe, as already has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| is compatible with several of the adjacent parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| which are already zoned office or office professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=8221)|
