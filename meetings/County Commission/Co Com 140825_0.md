| 0:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| For what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| right now is my chapter behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| They are the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| stand behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| what foolish rules I may make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| or things we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| They do it without question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| and they give me their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| mindful but they do it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Also, I'd like to thank Mr. Jack Allman, who is my VP, who is not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| And I suspect has a lot to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Mr. Allman is fighting cancer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| And he's had a rebound with a little incident of falling when he was going through chemo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| And he has got fluid on the brain, and they're trying to get that drained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| But he's still in ICU. He's been there for nine days now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| And they're looking at doing more invasive surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| So if you would, please keep him in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| But once again, my chapter is what does it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Mr. Tomlin, before you go too far, we'll do a pledge in the meeting in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| And we'd be honored if you guys would lead that after we get done in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| I think we need to take a vote on that. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=2999)|

| 0:50:10| Okay, pardon me for moving down here for the next little bit of our recognitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| Today, this is the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=3016)|

| 1:16:16| and to help us guide us through that process of just knowing the difference in certain names on certain bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| made a huge difference in how we voted sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And so I do appreciate you digging into that, and we may put you on retainer after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| But thank you very much for your service, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4592)|
| 1:16:50| Lisa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I had to promise her no speeches to get her to come in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| She's not anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Thank you for coming, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| And thank you for those very kind words, those flattering words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Jill, you're fabulous with the way you put those things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| I'm so honored by what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| And as was in the resolution, I've been so honored and blessed by this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| First to be, of course, on the city council and a large member for an awful long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| before term limits came through, and term limits came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| So I left, and thinking my political career was over, but then got interested again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| and was, again, incredibly blessed to sit right there, I guess, where Jeff sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| and represent the 4th District and the 4B seat for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| And probably the greatest honor politically I've ever had is to be an at-large member here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| which took me to parts of this county I never even knew were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| I've been to Corridor once or twice on the way to House Mountain, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| But anyway, I'm a regular out there at Corridor and Gibbs and high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| and Danny and Concord and Cedar Bluff and South Dole and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| I love doing it. I really will miss it. I really will miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| And I'm so blessed, again, as was mentioned, to be joining Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| and continuing my service to the citizens of Knott's County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| So I thank, number one, the citizens of Knott's County for that honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| and number two, the great honor to sit there beside you men and many ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| And when we were 19, I enjoyed that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| And that was a great honor also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| And thank you to all the mayor's people and the staff and the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| who have been so responsive in returning my phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| so I could return other phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| Before the wives go anywhere, Amy had an idea to come up with a proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| for the support of the spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| And so I'm going to allow or hope that Amy will present these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| So if you'll read them into the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| This is Resolution R'.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| Proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| Okay, it's Resolution R-14-8-106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| It's honoring Janie Norman, Sharon Smith, Lisa Shouse, and Vivica Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4768)|
| 1:19:39| Whereas the Knott's County Commission recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| that behind most elected officials is a spouse who selflessly serves the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| out of the limelight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| And whereas the spouses of Commissioners Tony Norman, R. Larry Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| Mike Hammond, and Ed Shouse are no exception to this call to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| And whereas the many contributions and sacrifices of Janie Norman, Sharon Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4801)|
| 1:20:09| Vivica Hammond, and Lisa Shouse have been vital to the success and effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| of their spouses in representing the people of Knott's County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| And whereas the Commission desires to express their gratitude to Janie Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| Sharon Smith, Vivica Hammond, and Lisa Shouse for their behind-the-scenes service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| to the people of Knott's County over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knott's County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| The Knott's County Commission hereby honors and extends their heartfelt thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| to Janie Norman, Sharon Smith, Vivica Hammond, and Lisa Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| for the constant support they have given to their respective husbands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| while serving on the Knott's County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| in their unwavering and meaningful service to the citizens of Knott's County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Janie Norman, Sharon Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| Vivica Hammond, and Lisa Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| as provided by the Charter of Knott's County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| Thank you. I just wanted to say, actually, this was actually Mike Hammond's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| And I told him that I would make sure that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| So, and I wanted to thank Jill and the Law Director's Office for putting this resolution together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| honoring the spouses of our outgoing commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| It's not easy being a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| And I think it's twice as hard being the spouse of a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| And I'm really sorry that Viv couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| But I understand grandchildren come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| But these women, I've enjoyed getting to know them as much as I've enjoyed working with their husbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| And they have been, I know, a source of tremendous support to their spouses while they've served on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| And we would be completely remiss if we didn't take the opportunity today to single them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| and tell them how much we appreciate everything that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| to make sure that their husbands behave during meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| And that we all function as a body, I think, so well as a body because we have such good support at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4936)|
| 1:22:27| So thank you, ladies, very much for everything that you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| not only for your spouses but for the rest of the commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4951)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| I think we're done with the honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| We're going to take a recess, and if the four commissioners, there's four chairs over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| we're going to bring them up on stage, the four commissioners with their framed resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| and we're going to have a quick picture, and then we'll come back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| So if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Come on, grab a couple of chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=4988)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5018)|

| 1:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Mr. Chairman, today I thought I'd preach from the New Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5662)|
| 1:34:45| Pick up an offering, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| I'd like to ask Commissioner Norman if you'd please come join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| Commissioner Hammond, would you come join me, and Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5692)|
| 1:35:10| Commissioner Hammond, if you'll take a knee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| You know, Commissioners, I think all of us are blessed with a gift, what they tell us in the New Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5713)|
| 1:35:22| And Tony, I think that you have a gift, that you came from the school system and taught science classes that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5722)|
| 1:35:29| and very well respected from your colleagues and from the students that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| You were an excellent teacher, and you brought that over to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| And you talked about streams, and you talked about flooding, and you cared about the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| And you cared about our slope and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| I saw that as a gift that you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Commissioner Hammond, come here, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| You have a gift of leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| You, as Chairman, you did a great job as Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| Anything you've done, you've always done your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| You're always very well prepared, and you're going to do a great job with your next endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| So, thank you for the leadership that you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Commissioner Shouse, you know, guys, we're seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| We're graduating today, so that's how we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Ed, you have done a great job with the finances and looking over the finances for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5785)|
| 1:36:33| As a commissioner-at-large, you were the first commissioner-at-large, and, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| you wrote the book on how to be a commissioner-at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| You were at every event that you could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| You were very accessible out, and that gave you a good pulse on what the community needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5807)|
| 1:36:54| So, we thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| We thank you for numbers and the way that you worked with the budget and could ask the tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| It's like what Brad said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| But I just want to thank that these three gentlemen all have great gifts that you've given back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| Let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Our Father, we thank you for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| Lord, I'm thankful that born in the town that we're born, born and live in the city that we live in, it could be a lot worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5837)|
| 1:37:28| We are so blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| We have so many blessings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| We hope that we try to do better for Knox County as the rest of our colleagues, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| Lord, I want to thank all of our department heads, all of our office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| because they have the will of the citizens at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| So many times, as Commissioner Shouse has said, that we'll get phone calls, and we call department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| and they give us immediate response so we can get back to the constituents and tell them and try to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| and make life better for them, make this a better community, make this a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| Lord, we thank you for your love, sin, and your son that we, through this, can have eternal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you for our time as commissioners here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Today the pledge is going to be led by the Rolling Thunder Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| If you guys would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Mr. Chairman, what I'd like to do is take a moment of personal privilege to have the veterans come up with them on the front for the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5908)|
| 1:38:54| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| They're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| All veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5944)|
| 1:39:16| Okay, bear guards, remove covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5960)|
| 1:39:28| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=5975)|
| 1:40:02| All right, can I get a motion for the approval of the amendments to the previous meeting, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Any opposed? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| All right, on the amendments to the agenda, I have one announcement that's going to occur at the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| One of the zonings on Topside Road, what was the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| 6B-1403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| 6B-1403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| RZ, page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| That will be the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| It will be moved to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| I'm sorry, the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| 6B-1403, RZ, moved to November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| It's going to be the request of the applicant, so we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| There was some opposition that was going to show up tonight, so we can call them and have them come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| And also, Resolution 805 needs to be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| The contract has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| So 805 is pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| I'd like to add just a very brief discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I have some financial information I have received from the schools I'd like to share with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| What I'd like to do is to add a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| We don't have it written up yet because it's not pertinent until 906 on page 17 passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| It deals with the fire station at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| But I'll bring it forward then just so you know what it's going to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| It's really a non-binding resolution that says that if for any reason rural metro ever leaves that station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| because it's a single-use facility that knocks county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| We have no relationship with either rural metro or with the owner of the property at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| but it would just simply say that the county would make a best-faith effort to try to put another fire station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| But there's no need to even have that unless that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| We need to add 106, which was the spousal resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| So remember that in your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Whenever we enter a motion, that will be in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Dr. Briggs, is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Move that we add all that needs to be added and all that kind of good stuff and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| So what we're doing, just to clarify, 805 is coming off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| 106 has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| The zoning issue will be moved in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| I think that was it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| And an additional discussion item, finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6170)|

| 1:43:03| which extends from Bob Warner Road to Felty Drive, on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6193)|

| 1:43:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=6196)|

| 1:59:41| The vote is 6 for Jenkins, 2 for Danker, 1 for Dunham, 1 for Lee, and 1 for Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| Mr. Jenkins is the new judicial magistrate, or upon approval of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7186)|
| 1:59:54| And what I need to do is amend the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| The opening is earlier than expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| It says September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| I'd like to make a motion to make the appointment for effect of August 26th instead of September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7201)|
| 2:00:10| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| So Mr. Jenkins, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Mr. Jenkins, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7220)|
| 2:00:31| Mr. Jenkins, I think Mr. Book will take care of the process on getting sworn in and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| That means you've got to work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| I may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| The next item is on page 4, resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| Accepting India Ken Cannon's resignation from the Knox County Board of Education as the second district member effective August 18th, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7253)|
| 2:01:04| And appointing an individual to the Knox County Board of Education as the second district member until the November 2014 general election results are certified and the oath of office is administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7264)|
| 2:01:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| We'll do this process exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| We will take nominations from each district and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| If anybody doesn't get six, they'll fall off the nomination list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| We'll recast votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| So I'd like to start the nominations in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| And when I make my nomination, may I have a moment to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| I'm going to nominate Rick Staples for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| Rick had community support district wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| There were wonderful people who put their names in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| But it was clear to me getting feedback from the members residents of the second district that he was had more support than any other candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7325)|
| 2:02:20| Not only with within his own neighborhood, but across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| When I was speaking with people in the second district about this appointment and they didn't have anyone in particular in mind, I would ask them what they were looking for in their new representative for the next three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7345)|
| 2:02:41| And there were some themes that came through very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| One was that they were interested in someone who was familiar with the school system, but not necessarily of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7365)|
| 2:02:52| They wanted someone who could come in and look at it with fresh eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| I think and probably in light of the recent election, the feeling was that there were enough teachers now on the school board and that it would be good to have someone who was familiar with the schools, but not necessarily of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7375)|
| 2:03:14| When we were asking questions during our interview and I asked each candidate about their knowledge of issues that were specific to second district schools, only two of the candidates were able to give really good answers and Rick was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7394)|
| 2:03:31| The people of the second district want someone who is who is open minded, but able to hold their own in a debate, but still do so in a professional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7411)|
| 2:03:42| Someone who is able to ask tough questions and push until they get a clear answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| I think it's important to note that Emma and Laura, who both withdrew their applications earlier, have sent in emails supporting Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7428)|
| 2:04:01| Two of our candidates, Betty and Diana, have both withdrawn their names from consideration in order to put their support behind Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7441)|
| 2:04:10| I also think when talking to people within the second district, diversity is very important to people in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7450)|
| 2:04:21| There's a feeling that on the school board there are too few men and too little racial and ethnic diversity and of course Rick's appointment won't solve that problem, but it's a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7461)|
| 2:04:33| So I hope that the commission will respect the wishes of the second district as it was clear from all of the emails and phone calls and speaking with people just one on one as I would run into them at the grocery store and the gas station and the pickup line at school and things like that, that Rick was far and away the one with the most support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7473)|
| 2:04:59| There were three other candidates who pretty much tied for second, but it was a distant second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| And the other candidates received varying levels of support, but it was far and away obvious that the second district would like to have Rick Staples as their representative over the next three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7506)|
| 2:05:22| It was also important to members of the second district that this appointee not be interested in running in November and Rick is not planning to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7522)|
| 2:05:31| So that's important to note as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| So I feel like I'm doing, that I've done my due diligence and that I'm doing the best that I can representing my district by putting Rick's name in as the second district's nominee for this position as school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7536)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| Go back to district one and then we'll make our way around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Second, I'd also ask the chair if he'd allow me to say a few words because I apologize to all the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| I was out of town on business travel and was unable to be here last week, but that does not mean I wasn't actively engaged in a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7570)|
| 2:06:24| And as I, like Commissioner Burroughs, as I dug in and tried to do my due diligence in this matter, I had a few things stuck in with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7584)|
| 2:06:40| For those that know me, know that I'm an advocate for education. I'm very active as we can be in this educational process while trying to stay in my lane here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7600)|
| 2:06:53| I heard Commissioner Norman talk about, or read about him, some of his statements and I agreed wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| They didn't have to be a teacher, but I do think the candidate needs to have a teacher's heart, a teacher's point of view toward these pretty important votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7621)|
| 2:07:14| We don't make idle appointments and so we have some very worthy candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| And then also, again, as Commissioner Burroughs said, someone that's not necessarily interested in running for the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| although I'm not carte blanche in favor of that, that's not a requirement for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| In this particular case, I do think that's important. It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| I think citizens of the 2nd District will get a chance in November to do what they're empowered to do, and that is vote a member in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7657)|
| 2:07:48| But, you know, in my life I've run across a very few number of exceptional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| And Ms. Cannon is one of those exceptional people that I have known for way over half of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7676)|
| 2:08:06| And in terms of not just socially, but I've seen her active within the school system, within the community, within the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7686)|
| 2:08:15| And I know that she will do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| And sometimes doing a good job will mean a hands-off approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| Sometimes doing a good job will mean digging in very deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| And so I'm going to nominate Ms. Cannon for the interim appointment for the 2nd District seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7709)|
| 2:08:48| Commissioner McKenzie nominates Juanita Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| I'd like to take a moment to say a few things about Mr. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| I'd like to nominate Mr. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| I heard him at both the interview session at Gresham and, of course, at last week's workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7743)|
| 2:09:14| And I think Mr. Fugate brings a variety of qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| Of course, he's a businessman in the banking industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| He has a background in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| He has family and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| He has a fairly intimate familiarity with the issues of the school systems right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7766)|
| 2:09:33| He was clearly, to me, the person that could represent the district with all due respect to Ms. Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7773)|
| 2:09:44| and to the people of the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| I've talked to several, too, and I just think he's the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| So it's my honor to nominate John Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| Commissioner Norman nominates John Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| I'm not going to give a little speech or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| but I'd like to put the remainder of the names up for nomination if that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7805)|
| 2:10:15| Nominate everybody on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| Now, somebody pulled their name out this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Ms. Ray, Ms. Lane, and Ms. Kildare was off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| She was off before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| So is it really 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| Two more names, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| So Ms. Dorsey and Ms. Searle will be your last two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Yes, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| I think you can only nominate one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Let's do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7849)|

| 2:10:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| I'll just take one second also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| I didn't know any of these candidates very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| but I don't think we're going to make a bad choice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| I don't know who's going to win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| but I was very, very impressed with every one of the candidates that spoke before this commission last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| and I'm going to take a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| I just wanted everyone to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| Commissioner Briggs passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7875)|

| 2:11:17| Commissioner Anders passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Is Dinah Wright, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| She's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| If elected, would you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| She withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| Can she do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| She can nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| I was just impressed with the way you answered the questions at Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| You're a mother with children in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| You seemed to know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| You lived in the corporate world and know how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| and I was just really impressed with your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| They weren't the normal what we want to hear type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| I thought you were a fresh voice, so I'd like to place that nomination to Dinah Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7910)|
| 2:11:59| Commissioner Smith nominates Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7923)|

| 2:12:05| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| I'd like to say a word or two, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| I think we heard from some very, very capable people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| but I think that it is each of our duty to defer to what the people of the 2nd District want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7937)|
| 2:12:27| I know this is only for three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| and they're going to have a chance to elect a new person come election time in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| but based on that, I'm going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| Commissioner Brown passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7961)|

| 2:12:46| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| I'd like to nominate Jennifer Searle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| Jennifer has kids in the system, both high school and middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7971)|
| 2:12:58| I know she's very passionate about educational issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| and she's spoken to this commission a number of times over the past three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| maybe six years I've been sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| and I think she'll make a great school board member for this two-and-a-half month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Would anybody that passed choose to announce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| I'll nominate Ms. Dorsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| I'm going to get all of them on there one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| I don't know if she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Mr. Ormby nominates Ms. Dorsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| Before we vote, I would like to say that I'm very impressed with all of the people that put their name forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8019)|
| 2:13:46| and I want to thank you guys for doing that, Ms. Cannon, Ms. Dorsey, Mr. Fugate, Ms. Ray and Searle and Rick Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8026)|
| 2:13:54| Really a very talented applicant pool, and it's very hard to pick one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| and so I do appreciate you guys putting your names up for that because it's not simple to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| It's easy, but it's not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| So we'll start the vote in the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8047)|

| 2:17:52| Mr. Fugate has seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Mr. Staples has four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| Mr. Fugate is the appointed, or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| to be placed in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| So we'll go ahead and read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| I'm sorry, Commissioner McKenzie, you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| I'll wait for the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| OK, Mr. Fugate's name is added into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8297)|

| 2:18:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| You know, we did a lot of talk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| Good talk, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| A good conversation about how we've grown as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8315)|
| 2:18:43| I don't think this is a good vote in that spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| I think this is a political vote, and that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| I think this vote is beyond the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| is beyond the service of what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| and what we're trying to accomplish in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8341)|
| 2:19:07| And I know I'm stepping on toes, and I'll step on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| You can step on mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| But this is politics at its, you know, it's transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| But this is, we talk about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| We talk about, you know, we throw the stones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| where we throw the stones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| And we cross the hall, and you know, AJ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| build and make it come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| This is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| You know, this is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| Hopefully, and I'll say this, hopefully folks are listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| Hopefully, the people of North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| are seeing what's going on here, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| say we're not going to be a part of this in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| I'm just going to add to that by saying that I had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| wanted to point this out, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| that I've been forced to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| The one person who did not receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| who I did not receive any phone calls or emails in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| of from any member of, or any resident of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| was Mr. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| He had no support within the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| from any resident of the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| And Mr. Staples had overwhelming support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Sam's right, this is a political vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| I'm tremendously disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| This is what I've seen here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| with the appointment of both our judicial magistrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| as well as the appointment of our second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| new board of education member, is Black Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| That's exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| I am ashamed of this commission, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| after talking about how far we've come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| and how much better we are than we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| This is a tremendous disappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| And frankly, it's a slap in the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| to every resident of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| who have made their wishes clear about who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| they want representing them for the next three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| And I am tremendously disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| tremendously disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| This should not be about anyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| personal political agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| This should not be about the good old boys network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| This should not be about anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| other than who the second district wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| And I am tremendously disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| tremendously disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| It looked like, to me, in terms of what happened today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| this became kind of an issue between Mr. or the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| was between Mr. Fugate and Mr. Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| I thought Mr. Staples was a wonderful candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| In fact, I wish I could speak half as well as you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| and as well as you present yourself, Mr. Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| You're truly gifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| Ms. Broils castigated us at the workshop for the fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| I have no idea what the fix is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| And I do not have the slightest idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| what she's talking about, some kind of network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| I'm not involved in the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| If there is a network, I simply made my decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| based on what, on the information that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| through two interview sessions and through speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| to people in the district and speaking to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| outside the district who are attuned to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| That's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| I made the best decision I could and frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| I resent any kind of indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| that there's some kind of fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| That is absolutely wrong and rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| Tremendously disappointed would maybe be common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| what I have to say also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Amy, I can't call you to tell you who I'm gonna vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| and I have several people that are still standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| in the audience that are mad at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| because I wouldn't tell them who I was gonna vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| because I didn't know until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| To say that no one in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| wanted Mr. Fugate to be appointed to the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| on its face is false because he lives in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| and just as a couple of other candidates called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| he called me and I have talked to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| I've been to all of the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| I've been to the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I have not been hanging around the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| In fact, I didn't even know we were challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| to the cold water thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| because I've got more significant things taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| in my life right now than to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| that I'm in agreement with all of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| that work out of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| So maybe you might wanna look back at the recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| of what has happened so far today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| and take it in a different light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| and that if you wanna say it's political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| because I didn't agree with you, you can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| But if we want to say it's political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| because that's the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| well, that's just the way this particular vote fell out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| because people in the second district did call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| Yes, I wanna point out, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| that the dynamics of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| have greatly changed a lot, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| It now goes over the other side of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| You have a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| You look out in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| you got several people that are running for that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| that are on the north side of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| I voted for somebody that I thought had a fresh idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| and I was impressed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| I know Mr. Fugate, see him in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| worked with him in the community on several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| I voted for him, and Amy, he supported my opponent twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| gave money to my opponent twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| but I still felt that given the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| he would do a good job and do it from the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| from a business standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| and he's got an education background, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| This gentleman sitting out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| I was impressed with him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| Just like what we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| guys, we had some great, great people running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| I don't think there's a bad one in the bunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| but I just want to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| that the second district dynamics have changed quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8772)|
| 2:26:12| I wanted to explain my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| and why I voted the way that I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| and I think I expressed to everyone the night of the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| that I was extremely impressed with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| who had put themselves forward for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| and I believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| I think we had some really solid individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| and it's not easy to put your name out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| but I did not speak to anyone on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| about how I was going to vote or who I was going to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| I did get a couple of emails from different folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| from a variety of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| but I never spoke to anyone personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| about how I was going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| and most of you know that I don't do that anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| but my reason for voting for Mr. Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| was certainly not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| I voted for who I thought would do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| or the best job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| and I had considered all of the other candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| and their credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| and when I looked at Mr. Fugate's credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| the fact that he has a master's of education from ETSU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| his major is administration and supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| he has certification for superintendent of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| he has been a principal and a coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| in the Claiborne County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| the Hancock County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| his BS is from ETSU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| he has a major in secondary education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| certification in health and physical education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| but I also wanted to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| about the involvement in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| and when I heard all of the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| and they were all involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| but when I saw that Mr. Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| was involved with the Calvary Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| he has a Bible study fellowship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| he's a board member of the Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| he's on the Fountain City Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| and Professional Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| Beaver Book Country Club, Farm Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| and he's a volunteer at Knox Area Rescue Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| and it goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| He's very involved in the schools through Shannondale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| as a foundation member there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| That's why I voted the way I voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| and any notion that I voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| on anything that would be closely associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| with Black Wednesday, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| I mean, I voted for who I thought was the best candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| and there were good candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| and I'm not saying they weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| but I voted for the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| that I reviewed all of the resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| went to the forums, and I made my own decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| and so anyone who says that I colluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| with anyone on this body are not telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| I'd just like to say that I didn't come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| to this meeting today prepared to vote the way I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8907)|
| 2:28:35| but I respect each of you all's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| I respect the knowledge that you have of your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| and based on Ms. Brewer's address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| before she made the nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| that's when I changed my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| so I don't see anything even resembling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| in any way Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| Like I said, that wasn't my first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| I glanced back at my notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| and the very first thing that I had written down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| I forgot to say something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| Mr. Staples called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| and we personally spoke on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| I appreciate his conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| and I thought we had a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| I told him specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| I appreciate him putting his name out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| and taking advantage of an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| to work in his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| It just didn't turn out that way today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| but you're still a good guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8984)|
| 2:29:51| Yeah, I did not want to go so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| as to compare this with Black Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| because I don't think it gets anywhere near that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| but I do think we're entering a very dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9003)|
| 2:30:08| dangerous season and trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| Just to be blunt and blatant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| there are forces at play trying to be the puppet master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9016)|
| 2:30:22| within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| Do I think folks are talking to other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| No, but I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| who want to be the puppet masters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| and I do think the puppet masters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| were at play in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9031)|
| 2:30:39| I hope as we move forward into the next commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9039)|
| 2:30:48| the next generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| that we will continue to take steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| not only toward a more transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| continued more transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| We made significant strides in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| but I would also hope that this partisan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| I mean, you know, one thing I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| I'll say it now because he's probably elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| Commissioner Briggs and I said when we first came on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| you know, this, we're not about the D and the R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| and all that, we're about Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| but more and more we've trending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| toward this just wall building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| and there are some folks that are trying to build walls up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| and that's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| That's a shame, and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| and I'll tell you, they tried to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| in the first district, passed the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| unsuccessfully, this is an attempt to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| You guys have probably doomed that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| for the puppet masters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| so I would just ask us, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| going forward, let's be about building Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| You know, this isn't about a fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| this isn't about an argument, no one wants to fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| no one wants to argument, I don't, I really don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| but when I see things that are just flat out wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I'm not gonna sit here and hold my peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| This was wrong, and I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| that the puppet masters were at play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| in this particular vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| Mr. Chairman, votes have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| Yeah, but I'm gonna let Ms. Brule speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| and I'm gonna end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| Commissioner Brule, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Vote has not been taken, you need to call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| we have rights, unless you call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| Thank you, no, I didn't see any sunshine meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| and I'm not suggesting that anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| that there was any collusion behind closed doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| but I think what Sam said was exactly correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| and that's what we did see on Black Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| was people who wanted to be puppet masters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| pulling strings, and I think that's what we've seen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| I would ask each of you, if this were your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9185)|
| 2:33:14| would you want your fellow commissioners to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| and think that they know more about your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| than you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Or that they know best for the members of your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| than they know for themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9206)|
| 2:33:31| Now, there's no doubt in my mind who my district preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9211)|
| 2:33:38| And there's no doubt in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| who had the least amount of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| within the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| And yet, I think that's what we've seen on Black Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| and yet, this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| And as regards to Black Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| my reference to that is that was another day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| where wishes of particular districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| were not taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| because there were people behind the scenes pulling strings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| So I'm certainly not accusing anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| of breaking the sunshine law or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| but this is not good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9259)|
| 2:34:26| And frankly, this commission, up until this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| has had a very good track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| with making appointments and keeping political agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| personal political agendas out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| So again, I am very disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| that the wishes of the people in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| were not respected here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9296)|

| 2:34:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| I am supposed to announce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| congratulations, Mr. Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9310)|

| 2:35:14| and I'm supposed to announce that qualifying petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9314)|
| 2:35:18| are now available, since the position's been filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| at the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| and so that process has begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| Is that correct, Ms. Waldrecker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9331)|

| 2:35:41| for the Carnes Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| This is just a carryover from as they build the new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| we've got a main stay in the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| So this is kind of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9357)|

| 2:36:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9391)|

| 2:36:35| some indemnification issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| No money difference, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9397)|

| 2:37:59| directing the Knox County Finance Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9479)|

| 2:38:05| put a hold on implementing the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| garage monthly parking rate increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| affected January 1st, 2013 to $60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9490)|

| 2:38:20| And number two, requesting the city county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| PVA parking committee to reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| subject to Knoxville City Council's action of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| as recommended in the city county PVA parking committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| report dated May 18, 2010 to review the parking rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9511)|

| 2:38:49| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| We have to have a real motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| Need a motion on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| Motion to approve just for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Gotcha, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| All right, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| Yes, I'd like to propose a substitute motion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9544)|
| 2:39:08| in the fact, to the fact that we leave the parking fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| as it currently exists, it's $47.50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| That includes all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| and the rest of this goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| You're making a proposal to freeze the price currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| and then also to cancel the reconvening of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9576)|
| 2:39:42| What do you want, Mr. Senator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| Yeah, the part-time rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| All right, we have a motion and a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| Everybody's clear what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| We're voting on to freeze the payment, freeze the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| and also cancel the reconvening of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| Yes, for those that were not at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| just a word or two of explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Dale Smith, the director of PBA, was at a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| and we had a pretty long discussion on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| and it was felt by all that, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| that the increase was not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| Number two, to follow through with the rest of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| with a joint reconvening of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| is like getting special dispensation from the Pope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| and was not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| So that's the reason that we cut this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140825?start=9633)|
