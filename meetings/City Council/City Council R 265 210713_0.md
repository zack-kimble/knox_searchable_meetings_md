| 0:46:41| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Mr. Mullins, looking at the staff report, it looks like the maximum number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| for this property is 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| That would be correct for single family dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| One of the benefits of the new zoning ordinance, they didn't just apply density to property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| but they had different density levels for different types of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| In this one, it's 45 dwelling units for a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| It would be, I think, 30 duplex units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| But we're talking still in the same range of what was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| A slight increase in density with the RN3 than the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| The only issue is if you get to trying to do townhome developments, which would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| even more density than that, that's a special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| That would have to go back through the Planning Commission and potentially this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Director Cannon, just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| That maximum number of units, that's without any physical restraints from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| like needing sidewalks or right of way or drainage, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| The designer will shoot to get the maximum number of units, but what we are seeing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| and more is constraints, particularly related to detention and other stormwater features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| that may cause that number to be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| And that was my next question was just, I've heard from some of the neighbors about issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| obviously with traffic and the impact this development might have, but also with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| And so would part of your approval process for a final plan be that you're going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| at traffic as well as drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| At this road, we will be doing a speed study on it probably in the next few months anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| just to see how the traffic is behaving, for lack of a better way of phrasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| And anytime that we have a development like this, if we see that there's a potential traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| issue and or storm drainage issue, then we will require them to do additional study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| Probably in the Dean Hill area, we will want to see the impacts downstream to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| that the system can take what's coming at it, even with the detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| And the results of that study might even lessen what's going to be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| Potentially, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Or they could do some on-site preventions that throttle back, if you will, the storm drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| Well, and just in particular, I'd just ask that you look at the neighbors that live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Winchester Drive and think about their ability to get in and get out of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| as well as any water issues they've been having around surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Absolutely, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2973)|
| 0:49:42| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Is there a bus stop in proximity to the proposed development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| On Dean Hill, I don't believe so, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| Okay, that may be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| I can make the water go downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I'm not sure on the buses, but I'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| That's something I'm sure that you can look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| That would be something that I would encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| We'll be happy to, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| If there's no further discussion, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3015)|

| 0:53:55| We have attended any community events that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| We also have—we kind of had some mishaps because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| We have tried our best to do, you know, Zooms and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| We're back up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| We help them with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| We help them—not with housing, but help them with the applications, because those are hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| And that is a bigger barrier for youth 18 to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| It's hard for them to, you know, understand some of the stuff on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| And that is a big barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| There's not enough housing for single youths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| And that's one thing that we are coming here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| There's not enough housing for us whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| So, we're having trouble housing them and keeping them housed, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| roommate situations aren't the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| So, one-bedrooms are not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| We have—we go—if they have separate, you know, like Western Heights has, you know, community events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| we try to go and set up our own table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| We hand out flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| She's even started doing cups with our stuff on them so people can have them to hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| We did at least eight different flyers just to make everybody happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| to show them that we are colorful and we are a team when YAB is a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| And we are—we try to be in the community as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| We have been a part of the HUD pick count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| We—as I said, I'm K-position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| We started a Youth Action Board Facebook page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| We have—we try to keep jobs on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| We try to do—we have trouble finding, like, you know, they have trouble with laundry needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| so we try to find them free laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| We try to find them food pantries as much as possible, because food stamps, when you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| because they have to strive to make, you know, enough money to get into a one-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| and often those can cost very pricey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| So when they, you know, go to pay for it, so it's kind of iffy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3378)|
| 0:56:27| So we have created a Facebook page for any free things that we can for YAB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3387)|
| 0:56:41| No, you're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| So some of the—I'm going to talk really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| I'm a New Yorker, so we should be able to get through this pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Some of the things that the Youth Action Board has accomplished since 2018 was being a part of the pick count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| which is a HUD pick count that they do once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We are proud to say that we do a youth-specific pick count in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| We are part of the COC, and we have been a part of the COC since 2018 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| Like Michaela said, we do have a Facebook page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| On that Facebook page, it talks about all kinds of resources that our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| our homeless youth especially, can tap into and get resources in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| We have flyers on all the CAP buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| This is all the stuff that the YAB has done, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| We have flyers on the CAP buses that has a QR code that all they have to do is pick on the QR code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| It directs them to our Facebook page where they can find resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| This is the first time in our community that we have anything for homeless youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| So I think the Youth Action Board really deserves a round of applause for everything that they've done in the few years that we've been up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3464)|

| 0:57:59| We have a core of six to eight kids that show up twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3479)|

| 0:58:14| Some of them are still homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| They don't care about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| For that hour and a half, they are dealing with the issues to end youth homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| They don't want to see another youth out there for not even an hour on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Our kids rock it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210713?start=3505)|
