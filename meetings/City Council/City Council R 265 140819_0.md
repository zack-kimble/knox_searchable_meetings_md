| 0:10:34| Councilman Wallace. Well, yeah, thank you, Mayor and Jim. Thank you for getting my answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| today. It is going to be a mass poll and you're going to put there, right? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| I guess I was wondering why is there, the answer that came back from your staff was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| it's utilities are not going to be put underground on that. They're just going to be strung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| Is that a reason because of cost or just simplicity or? Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| The wires are already there. I mean, yet simplicity, it would be more, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| actually, it wouldn't help the looks any to put them underground for just this one application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| because the wires are already there. Okay. Sometimes we put up mass polls and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| string four polls around and put wires on and that becomes the most unsightly piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| of the whole project. Right. I didn't get out there. When that can be done, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| it ought to be done. In this particular case, the whole system was put in place as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=690)|

| 0:12:38| help that water flow better and keep it from stagnating. So I think everyone's excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| the City's doing this. Right, and we actually just put up four signs, I believe, around the lakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| because I think I got more emails and tweets and Facebook posts and phone calls about that topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| than anything of recent and so we did put up four signs and Jim, do you want to just kind of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| about the next steps on this briefly? Okay, well just just for clarification, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Engineering is supporting Parks and Recreation in this project. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| something that they've initiated and of course this contract is to start the repair work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=792)|
| 0:13:24| particularly on the dam, the water control structure, fix the leaks. It makes it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| to control, fill the lake up all the way essentially. Because it's a local icon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| it bothers all of us, staff and administration, that there is all this thick algae and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| other issues. We do have $250,000 budgeted for long-term repairs and we are also eager to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| started on it. Within the month, the lake will be drained and the fish relocated. The muck will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=834)|
| 0:14:02| removed and then we'll start working on the berm, the leaks in the dam, and the water control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| structure. By the end of October, we hope that the spring will start filling the lake up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=848)|
| 0:14:18| Like I said, the repair will enable higher water levels which should have by itself have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| positive effects on the algae. The next step, the city will hire an environmental engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| The RFQ for that engineer is already on the website, so that process is already going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| That person or that firm will put together basically an owner's manual for operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| for restocking fish, caring for the lake, choosing what the appropriate vegetation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| all that sort of stuff, how to control waterfowl populations, maybe whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=897)|
| 0:15:06| those experts think are the most effective way to manage the lake. And I'm hoping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| they have some new approaches that we haven't thought of. So this work was intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| scheduled for fall, September and October are statistically the driest months of the year, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| having a little less rain to fight will help the process progress, help the project progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=927)|
| 0:15:38| So thanks to the public for your patience. We are making progress. We are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=938)|
| 0:15:47| Help is on the way. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Jim. Does that answer all your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| questions? Yes. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis. Yeah, thanks, Mayor. Having grown up literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| one mile from Fountain City Lake, it'll take you to the woodshed out there, if you call it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| duck pond. To me, it's still the duck pond, but regardless, I just appreciate you. I've been warned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| never to use that by the late Mary Lou Horner. She would never let me say duck pond. And she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| interrupted me in front of about 200 people one time to remind me of that. But I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| including it in this year's budget, and I'm glad that it passed, and just really it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| it is an icon and something that's been near and dear to a lot of folks' hearts, not just in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| City. It is heart-shaped. There's a good story in behind that, but thank you, and I'm glad it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| got through the budget process. Thank you. I just want to throw one other thing. I know Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| Campin could speak on this eloquently, but when you're out there, don't feed the ducks bread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| They're special food, and what goes in a duck comes out in a worse fashion. So it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| for you to help by using the proper feed. Thank you. Any other words of advice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| I'm sure our environmentalists could tell us a whole lot. All right. What day did they plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| to start drawing the water down again? Jim, what day are we starting to drain it? Sometime in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| September? Well, we haven't got the contract yet, so we have to go through that process. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| isn't a hard schedule yet until we get the contract finalized. I'd be curious to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| comes out of there, because I think I've seen a softshell turtle in there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| and probably a snapper or two, so it'll be interesting to see them relocate those animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1047)|
| 0:17:36| All right. You're speechless. You could sell tickets, maybe, when we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| Okay. We have a motion and a second to approve this contract to fix Fountain City Lake to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1064)|

| 0:19:50| hybrid buses and maybe something that's either energy efficient or environmentally friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| but they are pretty expensive, $750,000 it looks like each, so tell us a little bit about these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| buses and where we intend to go with that program. Don Distler, Director of Transit, and we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1201)|

| 0:20:17| electric hybrid buses, and they allow us to have a fleet that's a little more environmentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| friendly, so the fuel efficiency of these is better than straight diesel vehicles. They'll help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1224)|
| 0:20:32| the environment, reduce the carbon footprint, things like this, so they're just better all around for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| our fleet and the city. Okay, I know at one time we tried fuels from like deep fryers and stuff, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1237)|

| 0:25:13| Councilman Della Vopi, I do want to say we do have one person who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| Yeah, I was going to say, since these titles are sort of mind-bending, I wonder if someone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| staff, maybe our council over there, could just say briefly what each one is when they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| because the voters are going to be asked to look at these and approve these or vote against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| and it might be healthy to try plain English for just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| This is sort of a housekeeping one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| This first one is the housekeeping one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Kathy A. Slangler, the attorney for the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| Kathy, would you mind explaining this first one, the housekeeping one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Sure, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| This is, as mentioned, largely a housekeeping measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| It does several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| For one, it corrects the definitions that are within the system of the terms member and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| to specifically include references to Division H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| That was just something that was missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| during the last referendum when Division H was added to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| It also adds some clarifying language to the provisions regarding a trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| just to clarify that the funds can be held by a custodian in addition to a trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1591)|
| 0:26:41| It adds some additional clarifying language regarding transfers between divisions within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| If, say, someone would move from a general government position to a uniformed position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| and transfer from Division G to C, then there are also additional provisions within Division H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1616)|
| 0:27:07| that are already addressed in the Division H part and in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| This also deals with military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| Under the Charter, as currently drafted, the military service provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| when someone has to take a leave of absence for military service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| required an individual to make contributions to the plan that they would have made had they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| continued in service during the time that they were absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| And what this does is bring it consistent with USERRA to provide that if, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| if someone comes back to work for the city and they do make the contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| then they have to receive credit for the time they were gone performing their military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| But it doesn't mandate that they make those contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| It's just something that they would have to do if they wanted credit for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And it adds some language regarding timing elections for individuals within Division G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1684)|
| 0:28:18| that are moving from, decide to move from G1 to G2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| It slightly changes the time that they have to make that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| And then finally, it allows adjustment of the interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| on any refund that a person may receive under the terms of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| It's currently set in the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| The refund interest rate is 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| What this does is it allows the city council, through the supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| to set some type of benchmark for that interest rate so that that could fluctuate as necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| but never to exceed 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| But it has a ceiling that you could get an actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| If I could ask one other question, this decision on transferring, not transferring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| but changing from, I guess, G1 to G2, there was a lawsuit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| Is this related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| This was added to make it easier on the administration to process those election requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| This is, as currently drafted, then individuals who make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| once they reach their 10 years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| they have to make it within three months before the July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| following their completion of 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| What this would do is just allow them three months before they hit their 10-year mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| so that the administration doesn't get a rash of people all at once to try to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and they can deal with it throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| But it's completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Looking at each person's service kind of 10-year anniversary or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| So, again, this was housekeeping of get things in order the way we do things now, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| Or ways to improve the current administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1815)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I had a question about military service, but you answered that question in your explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1828)|
| 0:30:28| Any other questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Mark, do you want to come up now and speak, or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1836)|
| 0:30:36| So Mark signed up for public, I mean for these various pension amendments, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1836)|
| 0:30:45| Mark, I'll go ahead and set the timers, you know, for our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame Drive, and I'm the president of the Fraternal Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| Councilman Dela Vope, I appreciate you asking for that plain language explanation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| And I think I've noticed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I remind the folks I represent at the police department and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| When a lot of these come out, there can be a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| People don't understand the plain language side of it or what the actual effect of these things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| And I know that can be probably frustrating to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I appreciate your patience in dealing with it, Council and Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| And I know it's frustrating because, one, I had to try and figure out what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| and then had to try and explain it to the folks that it affected or could potentially affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| I just wanted to say that I know I have, and I know the other employee reps have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| diligently on that, trying to understand that and let folks know what these mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| And I'm happy to say that most of the folks that I've explained stuff to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| what the Mayor's intentions are with these and actually what the effects are of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| So I'm here, I guess, to speak in support of the Mayor's amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and to ask you to support the Mayor's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| I know the first three really don't have major effects on any of the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| benefits that anyone would receive or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| And then I guess all of them really don't have major effects on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| The child beneficiary thing, I think folks didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| I think you had a lot of single folks that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| hey, I've got a kid and that's all I've got, you know, when I've worked and I paid into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| And so I'm not going to be able to leave what I put into it to my kid or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| We're able to answer a lot of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| And, you know, the employees that I ran into understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| And we're pleased that, you know, that resolved their questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| We also appreciate the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| We brought up a concern about, you know, letting the Pension Board have a little bit of input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| into the selection of the additional members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| And she was responsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| That was another thing that concerned employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| And, you know, there's always, I guess, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| they're heavily invested in something and they try to protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| They get concerned over amendments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| They don't understand the effect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I explained that to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Myself and Cameron Faddis spoke with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| She was receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I think that the Pension Board does a good job of managing the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| I think for the returns on investments and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| these guys dedicate time every month, serve on committees and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| So, I appreciate the Mayor's consideration in that area as far as allowing them to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| or those representatives to have some input into the selection of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| If you're able to support that, we'd greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| And I thank you for any consideration you give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2046)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2051)|
| 0:34:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2057)|
| 0:34:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| And that is so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923 of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| by amending Article 13 of said charter, entitled Pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| to permit the supplemental plan provisions, as reviewed by the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| and approved by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| plan provisions, as reviewed by the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| and approved by City Council, to authorize additional forms of benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| including benefits payable in whole or in part as a single sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Same request, if that lawyer would just help everyone understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| That lawyer, Kathy A. Slinger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| please explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2112)|
| 0:35:12| A knowledgeable attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| The short is this allows lump sum payments or other forms of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| That's the short version, I think, but if you want to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| It enables us to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| It enables you to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| It doesn't do anything on its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| other than allow City Council, through the supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| to set forth additional forms of benefit that are not currently specified in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| and it would open the door, if Council deemed appropriate at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| to permit lump sum distributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And that would be done sort of annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| under the supplemental plan time that comes in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| The supplemental plan is not approved annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| It is amended as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| and it is amended at least once every five years to comply with IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| But we would envision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| certainly, if Council approves the proposed ordinance and it goes on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| that the Pension Board would begin working on some potential proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| to the supplemental plan provisions to bring to City Council, perhaps in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| And, in effect, this buys additional time, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| to analyze each of the changes that might come forward, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| By requiring it to go through the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And it creates some flexibility for the City to respond more quickly than once every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| If it determined that changes were appropriate and additional forms of benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| would be in the best interest of the City and the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| then it could make those changes without having to wait for another referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And, again, as I think I mentioned at the Pension Workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| there are pros and cons to doing lump sum payments through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Some in the corporate sector have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Some advise not to because of the potential impact on the corpus of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| So all of that we need time to really review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and before the Pension Board would make recommendations that we would bring to Council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| But this just enables us to have that review and see if it's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| in fact, is something that will help the fund or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| But you think that'll be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| You're looking at that to be done every two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2266)|
| 0:37:46| The whole idea is if this decision is put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| is made as part of the Supplemental Plan Provision, then it could be done at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| At any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Okay, so it's coming from a recommendation from the Pension Board back to us to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| without having to go to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Any other questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2292)|
| 0:38:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| by amending Article 13 of said Charter entitled Pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| to permit the Supplemental Plan Provisions as reviewed by the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| and approved by City Council to allow members of Division G and H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| nearing their normal retirement age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| to irrevocably elect alternative methods for crediting earnings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| on the Division G individual accounts and Division H hypothetical accounts as applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Kathy, would you please explain that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Ms. Ashlinger's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| This, like the ordinance that was just approved, is simply an enabling ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| It deals with the interest that is credited to the hypothetical accounts in Division H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| and also the Division G1 individual accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Currently, under the terms of the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| then those accounts would be credited with whatever interest rate the fund itself earns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| whether that's 15% annually or it's negative 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| So it would take the gains and the losses of the fund, the complete fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| What this does is provide a little bit of protection to persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| who may be getting close to retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| who may be thinking that I don't necessarily want my hypothetical account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| or my G1 individual account tied to the fortunes of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| which is diversified across a broad spectrum of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| I want something a little safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| So this would allow City Council to set an alternative for those particular accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| perhaps tied to some standard benchmark, a bond fund, a money market fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| something of that nature, but to give those particular individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| some protection as they near their retirement date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| And if I could follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I would assume that before this issue is decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| not on the Charter change, but on the decision of what benchmark or whatever to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| that there would be analysis and reporting by the actuary and accountants or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| as to any costs and any downsides and those kinds of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Again, we're deferring to the supplemental plan to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| and see if changes would work better or differently than currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Yeah, so that could be elected one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| I mean, I guess I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Is this something that's, again, going to come back to us for the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| it's going to come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Right, again, this is just the enabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It gives us the option for Council to adopt something in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| if we bring a recommendation and y'all deem it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| We can get together on the wording and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Any other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Are y'all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2512)|
| 0:41:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| 12D is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| by amending Article 13 of said charter entitled Pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| to clarify the definition of the term beneficiary in Section 1360.1J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| and to provide that a member of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| electing optional retirement benefits pursuant to Section 1350.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| may designate as the member's beneficiary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| only the member's spouse or such other person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| as may be specified in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| as reviewed by the Pension Board and approved by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| She's doing such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| After you're doing a great job, explain away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| What this does is it essentially changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| who a member of the system can designate as a beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| For lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| For lifetime annuities only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| As opposed to a number of years, an annuity for like 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| One option would be, you know, to choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| you know, you want a life annuity for the rest of your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| but if you die before 10 years are up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| you know, the payments will continue to your beneficiary for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| That type of option is not covered by this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| It deals only with the beneficiaries of a joint and survivor annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| where a benefit is paid out over the lifetime of the member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| the retiree and that retiree's beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| This particular ordinance would limit the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| that could be designated as a beneficiary to the spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| or potentially additional classes of persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| that would be specified in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| as determined appropriate by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| So it would immediately take it to the spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| and then if council thought additional persons should also have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| you know, be able to be a beneficiary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| that could be added through the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And this particular provision is the one that caused a fair amount of press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| and information and misinformation and consternation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| in the last six months or something, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I think that would be fair, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Okay, and was there a discussion as to the persons or types of persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| that would be such other person approved by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| or simply defer that to the future to the supplemental plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and some detailed investigation or debate later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| This proposal would defer that to the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| for discussion later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Certainly there was discussion among the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| There's been discussion in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| I would say one of the things, one of the questions employees raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| was if you had a dependent, you know, adult child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| or, you know, somebody with lifelong disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| would that be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| And, you know, so there are some issues like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| that employees have asked us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| And so I think we would review those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| what kind of, if there are others that we might recommend or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| looking at the benefits that are available already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| for other, you know, for others than spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| like the lifetime, like the 10, 15 year benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| Anyway, we're going to look at what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| and see if they're sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| or whether there might be some categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| where we felt like it would be something for council to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| Right, and the reason I was asking that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| it's logical that that would take further airing and study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| I would guess some taxpayers would wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| is there some hidden message in there that they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| you know, and I guess what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| is that the beneficiary issue is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| People would want to explore at the very minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| that it really is actuarially neutral in terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| That was said late in the controversy of the baby beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| But that all will be taken up at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| someone proposes something to evaluate what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Right, what the, Councilman Saunders, you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Okay, what I want to say is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| in terms of the actuarially neutral position on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| what this addresses, what lifetime annuities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| what we're addressing here is the long-term investment risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Remember that any, you know, our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| all of the payments paid out in our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| up until when the stock market crashed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| everything was actuarially neutral, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| I mean, it's all actually, you know, we haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| we make decisions that are actuarially neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| There's still risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| But there's a long-term investment risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And so when you have, so what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| so something is actuarially neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| a payment to a child over the next 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| is actuarially neutral if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| you get the seven and three-eighths percent return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| throughout those 50 years, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| And so what this addresses is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| that there's also investment risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And that's what's really hurting us at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| the investment risk that we had as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| And that's why we have the unfunded pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| The reality is that people, very few of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| have the ability to name a child as a beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| Less than 1% actually do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| because most are not in a position financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| to take the reduced pension benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| that they would receive in order for their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| to have a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| And so it'll, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| well, this will impact very few of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| But it does, where employees have opted for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| or would have opted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| it does reduce our long-term risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Again, having been a single mom for 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I understand having only your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| as your beneficiaries, but we do have options for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| And I want that to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| If you are a single parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| or you have a child with special needs and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| there are other options, multiple options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| to take care of your family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| But this is to address the long-term investment risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| that a lifetime annuity provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| So the default will be that the spouse will be covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| but anything else, anybody else in the other circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| would have to go through a review by the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| and then by this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| before anybody else is able to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| for a lifetime annuity, any other category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| There are options like setting up a private trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| and dumping the money lump sum into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| by the individual himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| if they want to take care of family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| There's lots of options, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Would that be on a case-by-case basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| No, no, no, it wouldn't be case-by-case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| but it would be establishing rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| you know, the rules for what sort of categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Well, those rules then will come back before us at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| The default will be spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| but if any other categories are added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| then that would come back to council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| Did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| I mean, Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| So that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| would there be restrictions placed on the such other persons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| In other words, people could name a child if they so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Other than a spouse, if you wanted to name a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| In order to name a child, if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| then in order to name a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| you would have other, there are other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| other kinds of benefits that we offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| that are not lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Can you explain that, Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| You know, currently under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and even if this passes and the restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| ultimately is approved by the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| for joint and survivor annuities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| there are still distribution options available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| to members of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| where they can in fact designate a child as a beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| What this does is for the joint and survivor annuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| that lifetime benefit over the lives of the member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| and the spouse or other beneficiary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| if city council, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| a bond review by the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| determines that somebody other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| another classification of persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| in addition to a spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| should have that opportunity to name a lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| you know, could be a beneficiary to that lifetime benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| then that could be specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| So for example, if council decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| if there's a single parent with a handicapped child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| that that class of persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| should be able to receive a lifetime benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| then it could do that in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| But it's not open to just anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| if this ordinance should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| That decision ultimately be made by the pension board or by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| The decision would ultimately be made by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| We would anticipate that the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| would bring recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| but those provisions would be required to be specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| in the supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| which is approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| So council would get the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| And in effect, we're cutting back the beneficiary to a spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| until we change the supplemental plan to name other categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| That's it, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| But remember, anybody who's already retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| and has that, that doesn't impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| We're not changing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Okay, other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Basically, it does away with lifetime annuities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| for other than spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| It gives us the option to add other categories of beneficiaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| in the future if council deems it appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3167)|
| 0:52:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| So, order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| 12E is an ordinance to amend the charter of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| specifically chapter 412 of the private acts of 1923| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| of the General Assembly of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| by amending article 13 of said charter entitled pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| by amending section 1324 to be recommended, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| to be recommended by the members of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| and confirmed by city council who will be residents of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| with financial or accounting expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| but who shall not be employees of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| nor members of the city pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| to the qualified voters of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| for approval as provided in article 11 section 9 of the constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| Councilman Dallagopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| I would hope, I don't know whether we need to motion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| but I would hope that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Councilor Esslinger would tell us what this is about in plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| What this ordinance does is it increases the size of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| Currently there are seven members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| It is made up of four elected employee representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| and in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| we have the mayor and the finance director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| who serve by virtue of their appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| and then city council has the opportunity to designate a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| appoint a person to serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| What this does is it adds two additional positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| as proposed, then those additional persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| would be recommended by the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| to city council and would be approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| These particular members would need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| some particular accounting or investment experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| to bring some expertise to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| and also they could not be a city employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| a member of the system or related to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| that is a member of the system or is a city employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| So it brings some outside expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and the goal is to get some independence to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| I guess I would like, if I can Mayor, to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| you started out saying that you were going to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| review the potential candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| and recommend one or more to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| and then as I heard the speaker tell us earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| you sat down with the police and the fire folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| and talked about a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| which would basically add members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| recommended by the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| and then submitted by you to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| for evaluation or vetting or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| And I never quite got why they didn't like that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| at least originally, maybe that has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| in the last several weeks since our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| but I'd like to know a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| because that was a little bit of a shift in direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| Same idea of trying to get to independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| The question is, are people within the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| picking the so-called independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| and does that compromise their independence or otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| But hopefully you can address how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Yeah, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I did bring this charter amendment to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| recommending that two additional members be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| both who would be independent, not vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| not have any family or whatever connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| to represent the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| The city, first of all, I want to state again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| which I think council understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| but make sure the public understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| unlike many cities and many companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| our employees pay 6% of their salary into the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| A lot of places don't require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| So they have skin in the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| In addition, each year the city pays a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| which averages about, correct me if I'm wrong, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| but about three times that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| is what we put in from the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| In bad times like now where we've unfunded pension liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| we pay about six times as much as the employees pay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| So obviously this is a pension plan for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| It is something that employees care about deeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| because it is their future, it is their pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| and they have earned it and they have paid into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| So, but there's also some beliefs in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| and I share that belief that having a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| of independent folks who aren't vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| would also add some value, bring some expertise to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| It is important to know that anybody that serves on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| has a fiduciary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| to support the pension system as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Their job is to make it the strongest pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| to make sure that we have good investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| that we make good decisions in the administration of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| This is not to, this is not, and my, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| my purpose is not to do anything to harm the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| it's quite the opposite, is to try and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| that it is well run, that it's well managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| and that those of us who serve on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I serve as mayor, that we have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| to this additional expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| We do have folks that we pay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| we have, you know, investment managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| and our trustees and there's all these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| that we deal with who are the experts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| but they are also paid to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| and so the idea of having a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| of independent people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| who might have some additional expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| that we don't have, I think would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| and I think it also helps the public to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| that they have some representation there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| and so the, so that's why I recommended it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| as I mentioned at the workshop, this is a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| it's a change from the last 50 years of the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| and I think some of the members of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| who have served, have served well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| and managed the program well, have felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| that they would like to also have some input into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| and the, when the representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| of our employee groups came to meet with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| we have an excellent relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| they challenge me all the time, I push back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| but we try to come to some agreement on what's feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| how do we, how we, you know, support our workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| and at the same time make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| that are good overall for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| So when they came with a, with a compromise you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| asking that I consider allowing the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| to, which would include Councilman Saunders, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| myself and the four other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| to recommend the two independence representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3593)|
| 1:00:02| I thought that was a good compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I have no problem with that, I have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| in the pension board that they would do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| that they would take this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| that they would vet as I would if I do this myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| and that they would come up with some good recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| that you would feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| So I thought that it was a win-win for both of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| I think you all know that when you engage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| who have a stake in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| we do this all the time through public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| and a lot of decisions that we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| you engage people that have a stake in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| then ultimately you're more successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| you get more buy-in and you see less division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| and so I thought it was a good compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| so that's why I amended my original proposal to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| and that's why I asked you tonight to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| as it is presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you Mayor and I'd first like to really thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3653)|
| 1:01:02| the administration for bringing this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| as long with all five of these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| you know we made some major changes two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| really taking it head on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| we know there's a lot of legal restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| but to make these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| these changes I think should be applauded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| and I'm just glad to know that we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| looking to make the changes we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I think this proposal in particular is a very good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| I think the pension board does a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| managing the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I think they've hired great counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| the last couple years the funds have been growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| they're doing very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| I'm not an expert but in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| so I think they are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I think the problem is and I think what this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| addresses is just sort of the appearance to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| of what's going on and the reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| that all the members of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| are going to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| could be pension beneficiaries someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| and I think to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| they see that as a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| and so looking at this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| what it does is to add two members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| that don't have that conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| and it's really the intent of the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| seems to me to really provide the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| an independent voice on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| and that's clear to me because one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| they have to be residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| which means they're either directly or indirectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| property taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| and they can't be employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| or family of employees or pension members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| so those two requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| it just seems clear to me that the intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| is to have these two members be an independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| give taxpayers an independent voice on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| so then we come to the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| how should these two members be selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and to me, it just makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| that if the intent is to give taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| an independent voice on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| that those two members should be selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| by the taxpayers through the representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| rather than the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| which is majority employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| The mayor represents the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| council, we represent the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| so I think it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| that we're the ones to select those two new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| The employees have their representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| we don't take part in that selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| so I think it only makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| that the taxpayer representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| would be selected by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| and that the pension board would not play a part in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| The other reason I think that's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| I think the way it's proposed, it might work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| but I think having the mayor appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| the two new members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| it would just be a much cleaner process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| There could be an event where someone is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| from reading it, it looks like what would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| is there would be a nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| there would be a vote at the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Well, if that vote's, what if it's 5-2 or 4-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| then that person's gonna be nominated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| and it's gonna come before council on a 4-3 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Potentially, you're gonna have different members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| of the pension board lobbying council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| to vote one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| I think that could put us in a very difficult position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| it could be an ugly process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| For the person being debated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| that could be uncomfortable for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| whereas the mayor makes appointments regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| to a number of different bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Unless they're known criminals or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I think we usually give the mayor deference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| She's been elected by the people for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| So I think that's important of eliminating those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| You know, what if someone came up on a 4-3 vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| then council didn't approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Does the pension board then have to send up somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| There's no time frame for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| They could maybe not appoint anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| so that seat remains vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| And then to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| they may feel like they don't have their seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| So I think, you know, it's a great proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| I would like to make an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| to revert it to its original form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| as proposed by the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| that the two new members be appointed by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| and confirmed by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| rather than recommended by the members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| But I believe there hadn't been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| I first need a motion to approve the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Okay, now I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| to amend the ordinance to put it in its original form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| I guess it's the July 9th form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| where the two new members would be appointed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| rather than recommended by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| I would certainly appreciate a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3986)|
| 1:06:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| And thank you, Councilor Mysterio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I think you made some excellent points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| I think one of the most important ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| or the most important one that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| is that we continue to work on the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| as we promised that we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I think that's going to be the legacy of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| whether it be good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| But I think it's a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| and we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| And it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| I mean, there's very few things that will come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| that will be harder for us to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| than a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| And that's what we're elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| And if we have hard decisions to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| then we've got to step up and make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| And four, three votes, and one have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| And as long as it's a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| then I keep that at waist heavy on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| I think I want to support the measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| as presented by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| I think the train has left the station, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| I feel very comfortable that there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| two more civilian employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| civilian folks placed on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| And I think that that's a healthy thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| and I think we move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| So, you know, the thing that I like about this compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| is that we do coming, maybe not lockstep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| and I appreciate the comments that Mr. Taylor made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| And I think that it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| that we foster those relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| not only with our uniformed bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| but the non-uniformed bodies that work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I think it's a good step forward for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| in future negotiations and future pension negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| And I think it's very, very positive for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| to move forward with this in lockstep, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| with, I think, two, if not three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| but I think two of the employee groups are in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| And I think that it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| I've spent a lot of time negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| with elected officials in my professional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| And the one thing that I've always found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| is that generally compromise is a great foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| for good legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| And I think that's what the mayor has presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| is very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| And I think at the end of the day, we still get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| I don't know that her picking up the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| or he or whoever it might be picking up the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| is going to make this process any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| So I like the legislation as it's being brought forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| just because of the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| it has given our employee further assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| that we do want to work with them as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| And like the mayor says, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I haven't said in any of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| but I'm sure she can be tough and push back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| And I'm sure she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| And the employee groups as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| So I think it's a good way for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| I won't support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| And I hope that we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| with the original ordinances presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Just had a question about the length of term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| of if two new people are appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| what would their, there'd be time limited, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| They're limited to two full three year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| The term is for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Now, the two initial appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| one of them will be appointed for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| One of them will be appointed for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| So the terms are staggered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| So they don't come due at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| But after that, they will serve three year terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| and they will be term limited to two full three year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| And Councilman Starr, you mentioned that two new people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| they will be required to be residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| And on the board now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| of the rest of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| with the exception of the mayor, council representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| who else on that board is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| to be a resident of the city at the present time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| If anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| I think you serve by virtue of either your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So technically, the mayor and the councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| are always going to be residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| The finance director may not be by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| you know, it depends on where that person lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| And I guess the four employee reps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| they're there as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| So I don't know if any who's city residents or not, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4262)|
| 1:11:02| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4267)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| I do, too, applaud you for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| And I think some of that is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| due to some of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| that a number of us on council have had about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| and when we were going through the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| And I think it shows that you listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| and brought forth a very worthwhile recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Either way, I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| And I think it's what the citizens are asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| is to have representation on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Somebody that does have financial wherewithal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| and knowledge of pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| And it is a very much a specialty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| that most, if all of us, don't have that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| And that's what I'm looking to have on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Simply, when we get down to these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| we need advice from people that have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| worked on pension plans and been in pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| And I think it's a really key piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I like the way you presented it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| And I guess I want to go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I think that's in the highest and best for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| I think it's what the citizens are asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and what I hear the most about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| Either way, it's a win-win for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I think that's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| I think it's best that, I mean, I trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I think I trust your ability to pick those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| to know their skills and know their background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| You see the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| You've shown in just three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| your ability to pick the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| and to put upon your staff and to choose wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| You have a broader sense of who's in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| and who those people are that have that knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| more so than maybe anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| And I think it's that expertise that I want to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| My vote for the amendment is not try to put anybody on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| that would be detrimental to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| That's not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4376)|
| 1:12:56| And I state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| But the point is that you know those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| You know you have those contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| You've run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| You're going to run again for office and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| You know who these people are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| And you're in a really key position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| to hear and listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| So I mean, I can see why they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| a little bit hesitant to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| I don't think it's so great that it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| you're not going to appoint somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| that is going to bust that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| So I think it is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| The best, either way it's going to be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| but I think the best is for you to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| and then let us vet that out one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| one public opinion or one public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| And we get to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| And that's a pretty simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| And I trust your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| And I think overall that's the best going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| So I definitely support STAIRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4428)|
| 1:13:48| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Mark Taylor suggested and said straight out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| that the pension board's mandate is to manage the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| And that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| And just as the mayor said a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| whoever gets appointed by whatever method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| those appointees will help to manage the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| They're not there as a hostile presence at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| I hope that's not looked on that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| by any of the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I must say, as you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| either way we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| the voters win, the employees, in my opinion, win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| We strengthen the ability to manage our pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| And I hope we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| I must say, personally, I am more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| with you, the mayor, or any mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| presenting those suggested appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| At the same time, I mean, realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| with the mayor, whoever that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| and a representative of council on the pension fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| that, whoever those appointees are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| are gonna be known by the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| So they will certainly have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| to render an opinion, and I hope they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| And I suspect, knowing that body, that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| But I am more comfortable going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| to your original proposal and going forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| As you said, either way will get us there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| but I'm a little more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4527)|
| 1:15:27| I think that with what Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| has had to say and what Councilman Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| has had to say, that I don't need to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| But again, also, I have the utmost confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| in you as the mayor and future mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| to make that selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| And I know that the telephone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| that I've gotten in regard to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| the folks that have called me have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| that they really do like the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| that you put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| They feel like that's a much better representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| And so I, too, also support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| One clarifying remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| The mayor suggests an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| by whatever method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| It either comes from you or through the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| This body, the council, has the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| Now, we handle many appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| just like we did today with a couple of appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| and they're all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| This appointment probably, these appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| will probably get a little heavier vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| than some of those others, as they should, as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| This is a new venture, and this is extremely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| to the long-term health of that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| And if we, the pension board, keep that fund healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| then we protect our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| And that's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Councilman Della Voca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Good points made by everyone that's spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| on either side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| In my view, the language in that subpart two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| should read something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| members who shall be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| and I don't know whether it's recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| or proposed or appointed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| and you could even have comma in consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| with the pension board, comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| and confirmed by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| But I think, I'd be surprised if you came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| with any names without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| especially sitting on that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| without talking to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| So the idea is that it still would be a decision made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| by someone answerable to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| And you have that, you're standing on that high platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and you answer every day to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| And this body has a similar obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| I would be surprised to see any recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| come here that wasn't somehow discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| vetted, talked about at the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| That certainly wouldn't prohibit you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| as your member, ex officio or otherwise of that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| to discuss it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| But it would prevent the deadlock situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| that Marshall hypothesized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I mean, could we have a 4-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and now we have a real unusual situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Do we appoint someone or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| I think it's important that we pick the best people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| who can bring independent advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| And like you said, in their fiduciary capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| it has to be pro-health of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| So that said, I feel more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| and I think the taxpayers would feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| knowing that the people they elect or diselect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| as the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| are trying to get people in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| that will truly help the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| Its success is important to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Its success is important to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| And we wrestled a bit about the $24 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| we were throwing in the pot this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| It's a big chunk of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| So I think the independent voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| should be wisely selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| but I'd like to streamline it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| and see you propose, recommend, appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| or whatever the words are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| subject to approval or confirmation by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| And I would prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| I don't know if that's the original wording or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| but I think that two-step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| by public officials is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4759)|
| 1:19:19| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4761)|
| 1:19:21| Well, since the mayor is on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| anyway, the mayor is going to have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| in who those appointees could be or will be anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4768)|

| 1:19:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4782)|
| 1:19:42| I'm thinking perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Is it really independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| Well, I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4788)|

| 1:21:01| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Thank you, employees who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| We'll move on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| We'll now go toward the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| Do you want to talk about those next steps and what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4875)|
| 1:21:15| Sorry, we still have the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| And then after that, we'll go ahead once we talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| It's been two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Yeah, you'll have a second reading and then it will be published in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| And once it gets published in the newspaper for the charter amendment, it will go on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| November the 4th for election by the voters on November the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| And if they approve it in that election, then the charter will be thusly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| 60 days later or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| 60 days later by in effect, it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Although, Kathy, do you know the number of 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4916)|
| 1:21:56| And then it goes into effect and then we move forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Of course, two of these are simply enabling pieces of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| So to the extent that they are enabling pieces of legislation, they won't really have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| significant impact until you utilize that enabling power to change the supplemental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| plan provisions to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| And also, what will be on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| Will these exact words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| And thank you, Ms. Mitchell, for reading all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| Will this, does this get shortened to a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Yeah, there's a question that's on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| And the question is at the end of every one of these ordinances, the question that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| appear on the ballot is in all caps at the end of each of the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| And that's what the Election Commission puts on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Let's see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Still a little wordy, but I guess it's hard to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| Councilman Kerr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Well, that's what I wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| That's what I wondered, Mayor, is that it certainly helped to have the layman's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| And if we can make sure that what goes on the ballot is layman's terms, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| Well, it's what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| So we're just going to have to make sure people understand what this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| I think we need to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4988)|
| 1:23:08| Which we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| We will work at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| Twelve, if this ordinance is appropriated to sum $2,500 towards sponsorship of Iams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=4993)|

| 1:25:03| there are certain misunderstandings between the two countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140819?start=5103)|
