| 0:03:17| city and we just want to take a moment to recognize all that she did as the first African-American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| woman to win election to the Knoxville School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=204)|

| 0:03:33| recognition for her leadership, of course a teacher to many and a surrogate mom, adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| mom to many, many hundreds of people really in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=221)|

| 0:04:03| center for seniors in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| That's at 3109 Ocoee Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| The center is behind the library on Edgewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| The center recently underwent a $400,000 renovation and expansion and so tomorrow at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| we invite you all to be there for the ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Also this weekend, Legacy Park Foundation will have the first Outdoor Knoxfest this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| weekend that is part of their Outdoor Knoxville initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=271)|

| 0:04:41| avid adventurer, the weekend warrior, the novice outdoor enthusiast and everyone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| loves to get out and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| Councilman Starr, I don't think they're going to have whitewater rafting, but I'm sure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| do very well in that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=295)|

| 0:05:05| of information on how you can register and get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| And my final announcement is that I want to recognize, you know a lot of our council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| you see the work that they do here at the meetings, you see them at the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| meetings and business meetings and such, but they all do a lot of work behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| to get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| It's stuff that the public often doesn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| And tonight I'd just like to mention one of our council members who deserves a big pat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| on the back and that is our Vice Mayor Nick Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| He worked relentlessly, really, with officials from Riley Foods, Knox Heritage and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| key players to get the historic JFG sign ready to return to Knoxville as a landmark and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| watching it from my window go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| At Booms Day, somebody will get the chance to flip the switch and light up the JFG sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Vice Mayor Pavlis held talks with Riley and even visited them when he was down in New| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| Orleans on business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And he did that because he has such pride in South Knoxville and he knew what the landmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| meant to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| So Nick, I just wanted to thank you for your dedication to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| It's not only important to South Knoxville, but to all of Knoxville because it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| an icon in our, you know, just to Knoxville for, gosh, over 50 years and, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| just important that it came back and I'm just proud that it's in the first district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| it's for the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Thank you for the acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| I've got a list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I'd like to announce that this Thursday at 5.30 in this room that the golf committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| will be reconvening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| That's the first time that it's met, I think, in a couple of two or three years, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| golf courses at the city of Knoxville operate, are a park, if you will, and it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| that we see that they're operated properly, so I wanted to revive that committee, so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| have our inaugural meeting this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| On the 30th in this room, as well, beginning at 5.30, we'll have a workshop on crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| It's been a great subject of concern to this council, so I'm sure that will be a lively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| evening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| I also just wanted to make mention, too, of the urban wilderness, of the loop, the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| loop that opened a week ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| We had about 250 people at 2 o'clock on a Tuesday, and it was a sweltering Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| but it just really shows the support that this loop has meant to not only south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| but the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| It's been just a really great partnership, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| I mean, Legacy Parks, of course, has championed this 1,000 acres that we're preserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| IAMS, the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club folks, I mean, my hat goes off to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| I think they've put more sweat equity in this project than anybody, and just the TWRA for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| allowing us, first time in the state's history that they've allowed this type of a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Of course, the city and the county, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| It'll connect 10 parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=503)|

| 0:08:28| It also includes three Civil War forts and historic sites throughout south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| So, I mean, this is a legacy that will be here for our grandchildren's grandchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| It's just something that we can't turn back or stop this now, and it's going to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| put Knoxville on the map in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| We're already getting, we've had, I know of at least two pretty major events that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| had where we've had beds and heads, and, you know, it's an economic development tool, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| it certainly brands and highlights south Knoxville and the natural beauty, and it's two miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| So, I mean, how can this be wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| I mean, this is a really, really great asset to our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Along with that, we thought about having a promotion for the vendors in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| What it does, in essence, if you visit 15 of the 20 participating vendors and get stamped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| at their stores, and I would encourage you to go to uwaandtd.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| It's uwaandtd.com, and to download these sheets and to learn more about the promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=574)|
| 0:09:44| that's going on between now and August the 31st, we'll quit accepting the cards at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| but the lucky participant will win $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| They'll get a VIP package to the Boomsday where we're going to light the JFG sign that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| the mayor mentioned, and so that's a real good promotion for folks in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| and Knoxville to take advantage of, and I certainly hope that you'll go over into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| south to my district, 1st District, and help the merchants that are, you know, suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| through the bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| So with that, I believe that's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| First of all, I want to announce that the signed task force will not be meeting tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| So for those of you, hopefully you got an e-mail today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Unfortunately, I want to give our condolences to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| He's going to have to go out of town to a funeral, and so we're going to postpone the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| The other thing I'd like to do, Mayor, and I assume this is an appropriate time to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| this, but you have an individual who has worked for the city for over, or that I have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| that's worked for the city for over 36 years, and I didn't realize that tonight might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| her last council meeting, and so I would just like to recognize Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| I've known Anita since we were trying to figure this out, and I think it was 1976 when she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| was at the old city hall that we first met, and she was a secretary, and being an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| I walked in to review some plans, and that was the beginning of a long working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=676)|
| 0:11:25| As all of you who know Anita, it's been a smooth sailing relationship with Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| We've had our differences, but at the same time, we've always been able to work things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| I really feel that she's going to be sorely missed, and I would just like to really recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| her for all the good work that she's done for the city, and especially that she's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| individual mayor who really loves Knoxville, and she has shown this through all her endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| from working as a secretary on that front desk to being in charge of codes, and Anita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| I just want to say that I will certainly miss you, and I'll miss not only that smile, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| also those frowns you've given me from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| It's almost like having Pat Head Summit sitting in front of you sometimes, but anyway, Anita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| I just want to say thank you, and we appreciate all you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=735)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you for expressing the views, and the affection, and the appreciation of many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| us around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I just wanted to announce that the Public Facilities Naming Committee will meet September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| 6th at 530 in the main assembly room, so that's in 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| If you have anything, please get it to me or to Cindy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| That's the Public Facilities Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| It's September 6th at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I just wanted to mention that an issue came up last night at the Alice Bell Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| They were meeting to discuss with U.S. Cellular a new tower they're building over by the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| And it was not clear during the meeting, let me back up, I guess the issue was we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=798)|
| 0:13:28| our zoning ordinances that require companies to share these pole facilities so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| can have three, four actual transmitters on one pole and minimize the number of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| towers that have to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And it wasn't entirely clear at the meeting how well we enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| MPC is at least charged with reminding people to take a look at the opportunity to mount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| your transmitter on one of those existing poles, but we may want to take a peek at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| own zoning ordinances or enforcement tools to see if we can follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And I'm not sure exactly how we do that, whether Council could look at that for us or from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| But it was an interesting question because what we were told and have been told is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| this new 4G network kind of standard that's coming out is encouraging lots of companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| to get new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| And of course, we're all sort of participants in that because we all turn on these magic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| devices and use the cell towers and get the data and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| But if there is a way to be sure that we're minimizing the number of them proliferating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| we ought to take a look at our own codes and make sure we have everything in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| So I just throw that out as something for us to look at because it's an issue that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| growing and I think Mark said that he's getting a fair number of these applications coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| So just to sort of double check our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you, Councilman, for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| We do have in the Law Department an attorney, Angela Halver, who has a great deal of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| And it's a difficult area because you have the federal law working in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| the local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| And sometimes you'll discover that federal law in some ways trumps the local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| But you have to know how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| And they do work in conjunction with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| And she understands that pretty well and has been working very diligently to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| to date on what the latest changes in that situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And I know that she's in close communication with the folks at MPC with regard to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| And so we do want to stay on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| We recognize that co-location is certainly ideal and something that we strive for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| And I don't think folks will get through the process without at least knowing that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| what they should look to first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| One thing that you run into is the federal requirement that says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| And say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| So if they have a need, you can't say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| You can't leave them in a situation where they can't provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| And so the difficulty in proving that you can provide services in an alternate way can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| be somewhat problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| And is that an aspect of encouraging the co-location and making sure there's a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Or maybe our mapping system could help people find those co-locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| But I just thought it's worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| And a fascinating sidelight was during that meeting, someone's cell phone went off two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| or three times just because everyone's connected to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I mean, it's just the way we live these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| I have two more announcements that Councilman Grieve made me aware of or reminded me of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| First, tomorrow there's also another ribbon cutting at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| There is a new exhibit, the lions and the baboons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| And so tomorrow at 4.30, we'll be cutting the ribbon on wonderful new facilities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| we have at our top-notch zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| And also, we have in the audience a Boy Scout troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| That is Troop 246 from here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| They are sponsored by the Grace Lutheran Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| And I understand you're working on two merit badges, one on communications and the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| on citizenship in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| And hopefully what you'll see tonight will give you some, you'll learn something good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| about both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1053)|

| 0:19:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay, we have a motion and a second, and now Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Last time we voted, as you'll recall, to remove Sections 3 and 8 from this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1185)|
| 0:19:54| I would like to now, and I think all of us have received from the Mayor the suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| that we restore, if you will, Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| There was some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Certainly, I was confused, and apparently many others were confused by the Section 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| And I would like to recommend and move by amendment that we restore Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| And if anybody has any questions about Section 8, I understand Attorney Swanson has copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And besides, it's in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Could I help you clarify your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| I just want to clarify your motion a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| What you're suggesting, what you're moving to do is to restore to Section 8 the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| that was removed from Section 8 last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Section 8 is a really long section, and all of it was not removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| But what you're suggesting is that we restore to Section 8 only that language which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| removed from Section 8 last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Actually, that's set forth in 1381.7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| And we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Also, we do have some people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Do you want to go ahead and ask your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Mine's a minor thing, and I just wanted to say that, as I understood it the way it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| there was a Section A, which is still in here, 1381.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| It's no longer lettered A, but that would get the A, and we'll put the B back in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| so that it's restored to its original appearance and numbering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| It's just a technical...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Actually, we'll find all this language on our page, packet page 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Do you want to speak now or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| We also removed some language from Section 3, some similar language, and I was just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| if Mr. Mason could address what that language did, and having it removed, what effect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1307)|
| 0:21:58| had, and if you would recommend including that, as well as the language in Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| Please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| William Mason, 3560 Tlahee Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| Sections 3 and 8 were intended to serve the same purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| It's my view that restoring Section 8 is sufficient to provide the city with all of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1343)|
| 0:22:35| flexibility that's available, consistent with the Blackwell decision under state law, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| applicable federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| So not having the language in Section 3 basically has no effect, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| With 8 restored, not having 3 is entirely sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| We have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I see Mr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| You were just getting comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| We have some folks signed up to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| This is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Anita Cash, 160 Byrd Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1399)|
| 0:23:30| I'm here on behalf of the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I don't think I've ever come up here in front of you with nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I do want to thank Mayor O'Hara, Vice Mayor Pavlis, and the city administration, and each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| of you for working to get this question, get the plan developed, and get this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| out to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| If you'll recall two weeks ago, when I asked that language that you have the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| to put back in, my original suggestion was, if you don't want to take it out of both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| them, at least take it out of Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| But you voted then to take it out of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| I understand totally why you're putting it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I do think that this pension plan, while it is not what we have now, is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| It sure beats nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| It sure beats a 401k.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| And I just want to thank you all for your hard work, your many hours of work, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| to thank all of the employees who came to the many, many workshops that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And I ask you to support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1481)|

| 0:24:44| Joel Goucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1484)|

| 0:24:56| Pretty big shoes to follow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I just want to thank you guys for your work on this stuff, but I do want to just offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| one final note, as this, I'm sure, is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Just a cautionary advisement that none of these savings kick in for 25 more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| And it just appears to me that from the very beginning of the task forces, this thing has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| been rushed through, and I would ask that you just take a moment and think in your minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| that as we go and alter the pension plan for future employees for the city from here forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| any employees that are hired, it's not too late to pump the brakes just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| and make sure that we put a plan in place that everybody is completely happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| Good luck with that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| But something that we all have knowledge of and that we all feel comfortable with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| going forward that we can still recruit and retain the best employees for the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| feel like that we're not having this one-sided issue to really bring down the recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| of the employees for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| I do thank the mayor for all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| I know this was kind of dropped in your lap, and you did your diligence to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| we have something that is somewhat palatable, but it's not too late to pause and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| 25 years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| If we wait two more years to the next general election to get something on the ballot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| make sure that it's completely, all the T's crossed and the I's dotted, it's not too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| time to ask for two more years when we won't see savings for 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1620)|

| 0:27:17| I, like Anita, would like to take the time to thank you, Mayor Rojero and Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Pavlis and members of City Council for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| As I think we all know, there are parts of it and each of it that one or the other of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| us don't necessarily like or would like to see this way or that, but I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| I know a lot of hard work has went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| I know it's serious stuff that we're dealing with going forward, so we appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| effort you put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| On the language, I won't tell you that I wasn't entirely pleased to hear that it had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| removed on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I'm probably more comfortable that way, but if you're going to restore part of it, Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| 8 is more acceptable than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| I'd understand why going forward you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I don't think it's entirely necessary because I think the plan and the process we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| is going to be very adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I think you're going to see down the road that there was a lot of wisdom in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| this was designed, especially with the funding criteria that's matching from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| which should ensure its stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| I thank you all for that responsible leadership and I would urge you to support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1715)|

| 0:28:47| If I could take just a second, I want to thank Anita personally for representing the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| groups as well as the other groups up here when she spoke on all of our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| I certainly want to thank every member of Council, the Mayor, the Council's Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| I know this has been a hard, hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I feel like we've been fair and understanding in trying to hammer all this out as you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| Some of the language, as Mr. Taylor spoke, we weren't real happy with it but after speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| with some members of Council, we feel a little more comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| I know it's a hard decision to go forward and as Vice Mayor Pavlis said about the JFG sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| I'm certainly hoping that maybe these pensions come back around, not in 50 years but maybe 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| and we can flip a switch on that and get going again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| So on behalf of the firefighters...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Wish us luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I won't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| But I do want to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| I know it's a hard process and I'm glad to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| I would say I pulled my hair out but it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| I'm working on my arms now but thank you all and I'll adjourn with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Okay, we have a motion and a second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Are we ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| We're going to address the amendment and then the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| First it's on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| We are now back on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Councilman Dellivolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| I guess I want to say a few words here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| I know that we have not always agreed on the choice of the remedy that we've tackled on the issue of new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1842)|
| 0:30:52| but we've all worked very hard, I think, to take a look at it and all of the aspects of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| and it certainly has been, I think, a good process for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| We are beginning to look at the overall problem of pensions and the cost of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and I think that's a really healthy thing and I commend you and your administration for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| I have, in the past, voted against this hybrid plan because I thought two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| One, that it would be nice to have a choice on the ballot of this plan versus a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| and let the voters, the ultimate decision makers, pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| That's not going to happen and we now have a plan that, for better or worse, is certainly something better than was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1892)|
| 0:31:42| And I think the time for debate has passed us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| This is our chance to get this on the ballot and before the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and to sort of get them a chance to start changing the path we are headed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| So I am going to reluctantly support this tonight because I really do think the council has reached a conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1919)|
| 0:32:10| that we would like to give the voters a chance to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Like I said, it's not my favorite choice, but I think it is better than what's in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and I think we have to start moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And so with that said, I'm going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| We're glad to have your vote, even if it is reluctant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| I just want to say that, you know, again, philosophically, I disagree with the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| but I am encouraged that we're going to at least cease with the present pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| But, again, though, I still feel very uncomfortable with the fact that we're going to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| and we only have one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| But with all due respect to you, the mayor, and my fellow colleagues, I will not be voting in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| But I will be working diligently, and I hope that this is just not the end of the whole discussion of the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| I think we have a lot of work to do, and I'll certainly jump in and do my part on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| But thank you, mayor, and thank my colleagues for all the work that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Is that two noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And before we move on, I would just like to take a moment to also express my thanks to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2005)|
| 0:33:34| This has been something that for several months we have debated and talked about and worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| in numerous workshops, and Vice Mayor Pavlis and all of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| thank you for putting your head into this and having such a thorough dialogue about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| I want to thank my staff, particularly Bill Lyons, who really did the yeoman's work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| and, of course, working with our attorneys and members of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| the numerous city employees who were brought into this in different ways to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| And I really want to recognize the head of our employee groups, Anita Cash, Mark Taylor, and Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| You all are fabulous to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| You have well represented, and not everybody gets to see all the meetings we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and the dialogue, the debates, and the way you all really stood up for your membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| which I respect very much, and how we struggled with how to accomplish what really I set out early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2076)|
| 0:34:46| which was to reduce costs to the taxpayer, reduce the market risk that we faced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| and at the same time to remain to retain a package that is competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| so we can recruit and retain the best employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And we have the best employees now, and we don't want to lose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| So it's been tough, but thank you for the way you worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| You know, I think good leaders are realistic, and they analyze the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| and are willing to go back to their membership and tell them what's tough, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| tell them the tough things that people don't want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| That's what we all have to do as council members, as a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| We have to tell our friends and our constituents sometimes what they don't want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| and that means the reality of the situation and what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2133)|

| 0:36:47| So it's very important that we get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| We need the support of the media, of the public, of the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2209)|

| 0:42:49| I did get a letter and if Mr. Harb could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I just want to repeat what I asked him two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| We did receive a letter saying that the neighborhood was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| The neighborhood was also concerned that you all have not had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| to meet between the school and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| But I understand that it's not official yet with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| But you did send a letter saying that in the preliminary stages right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| that as far as the lighting goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| that the lighting will just be in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| more or less security lighting for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| And it's my understanding that as far as the signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| that you will follow the code requirement for signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| and that there will be signage on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| There will be a monument sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| but there will not be a high 50-foot pedestal sign along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2619)|

| 0:43:41| I just want to be on the record with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| I think we have addressed those concerns that Ms. Maurer had on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| And I also want to just repeat again that both the neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| has commended you for the work that you folks have done with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| and it's been a good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| And we hope it continues to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2636)|

| 0:44:05| But I just want to let you know how it was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| We appreciate the efforts of everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2649)|

| 0:44:14| and then it went on to MPC and got a great fellow in Mike Perceau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| He was just great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| And then it was Ms. Maurer and then Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| It was a totally nice effort, and we appreciate the efforts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2665)|

| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2930)|

| 0:49:00| Marcus Chady, 2841 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Sir, according to our rules, you can have up to three speakers for a total of five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you, Ms. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I'm the only speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I'm the architect representing the owner's interest, Richard Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| What we have is a site that is a flag lot that has a joint permanent easement that constrains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2959)|
| 0:49:28| a good portion of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| So, along with the irregular geometry of the lot and joint permanent easement, two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| that don't generally exist in the district, we feel we've got a hardship that makes meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| the strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| The mixed occupancy building has got primary use that the 34 paved spaces that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2987)|
| 0:49:57| to provide will adequately serve that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| There is a second infrequent use that may require some overflow parking, hence the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| for 108 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| We have a gravel surface lot on this same parcel, and although City Stormwater has advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| us that they're in the process of providing some allowances for parking on a surface other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| than a sealed surface, say concrete or asphalt, those revisions to the ordinance have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| yet taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| In our discussions with City Codes and Stormwater, we've arrived at the conclusion that to pave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| the additional area of the lot and thus increase stormwater runoff for such infrequent use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| just doesn't really match the intent of the ordinance, nor is it consistent with the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| infrequent use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Is that it, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| You have no other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Is there anybody here in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| I just wanted to ask Mark Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Mark, as I understand it, our zoning code requires paved spaces for these 108 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| and not just the 34 that they have at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| I'm going to hand it over to a mic that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| The required parking within a parking lot must have a sealed surface according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| So as the law currently exists, this does not meet that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Come back, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| You got to 108 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Go through the calculations how you got to 108 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| We'll let the architect answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| The infrequent use is an assembly use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| And with an assembly use under the zoning ordinance, the spaces required are one space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| per three occupants based on the occupant load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| And again, that's the infrequent use that jumps the requirement from about 24, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| it is, from 24 to 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So it's a pretty precipitous jump from what would typically be happening there relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| to the occasional parking that would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| And again, Mr. Della Volpe mentioned the distinction between a sealed surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| And that is the very reason that we are seeking this variance is because of that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3168)|
| 0:52:56| And you can't get cross-parking easements with your neighbors or to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| We have investigated off-site parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| The closest sealed surface parking lot that has excess parking, that's a key consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| when leasing parking from an adjacent property owner, is over 400 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| It's about 510 feet from the building it's intended to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| So there were some concerns from codes about whether it would be better to have the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| patrons parking on gravel or walking 510 feet to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| And we collectively determined that the route that would best serve the public would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| to just allow infrequent parking on gravel rather than having the patrons traveling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| additional distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| And infrequent, what do you mean by infrequent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Once a quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| What's your anticipated use of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| The fire marshal's office, along with codes, has dictated that we will use the space 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3235)|
| 0:54:06| to 12 times per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Where this infrequent use comes from is that the building has been vacant for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| And so it's a gradual process of bringing it back up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| This is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| If use is to become more frequent, then along with the parking, other improvements will be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I think you asked one of my questions is that when you talk about infrequent use of, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| five or six times, there's nothing to say, though, that it can't be 12 times, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| The fire marshal's office actually will control when these events are held as there's a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| for them to conduct a fire watch at these events, which have been held in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| The difference being that the events that were held in the past were, although in the same building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| a different owner on the building conducted the events without the proper permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| So what we're attempting to do is go through the proper channels of permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| certificate of occupancy, and working with the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| So the fire marshal's office requirement for the fire watch is the safeguard of the intensity of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| if you will, to limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Well, the other concern I have is I know there's a facility in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| and there's also a facility on the right where they have an easement through your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| to get to their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| And the concern that I have in terms of reducing the, I'm not concerned about the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| What I'm concerned about is the parking and the parking requirements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| I know I have several situations in my district where we have several businesses that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3352)|
| 0:56:02| to have a certain amount of parking, but there's not a lot of overlap parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| which is in different areas and they're taking up the different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| and there's really not enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So there again I have a real problem with reducing the parking requirements from what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| The other thing, Mark, I want to ask a question to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| Have we in our codes, do we approve the permeable parking materials that are out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| that allow drainage to go through them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Has that been allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Or is that Mr. Hagerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| As of right now, Jim Hagerman, City of Knoxville Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| as of now we're interpreting sealed surfaces to exclude any of the other surfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3405)|
| 0:56:54| any of the engineered surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| And a graveled lot does not, well, it's not an engineered surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3416)|
| 0:57:06| Right, but the new pavers that are coming out and the ones, those are not approved yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| The sealed surface ordinance would exclude their use as it's currently applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Something we might want to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| We are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Councilman Dalibolfi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| I just want to ask one other question to the gentleman at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| Without this variance, you can still operate the main activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| which you said you had enough parking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| This is just the special events addition requires the extra parking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| You can use your building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| For limited use, not for the intended use that the owner purchased the building anticipating to execute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3469)|
| 0:57:59| So what's the limited use that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| The building is of a particular size that if we were to hold smaller events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| and subdivide the building into three partitioned areas, then we could meet the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3491)|
| 0:58:21| However, in order to hold an event in the one space, the parking requirements increase considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| My question was you can still use the building for a purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| and you bought a building that has a zone that's acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| and the 34 spaces are adequate for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Any other questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I may have another speaker if I can still utilize one of the two available speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3528)|
| 0:58:58| If the building owner wishes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| This would take, according to our law director, according to our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| this would take you all amending your rules, saying that you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| I'll move to amend to hear another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| We have a motion and a second to amend the rules and hear another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Please come forward and state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| My name is Richard Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| I reside at 2418 Woodrow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| I own the property in front of the warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| and in the process of purchasing the property next door also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| The warehouse was purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I've worked on the deal for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| and it was purchased for a particular event that we've done for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| but the parking, like I said, we've had the events in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| and the parking has never really been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Knoxville-Harty-Davidson is a major sponsor of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| We've used their lot for years, which is just over the 400 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| It's at 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| They've got hundreds of parking spots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| My neighbors next door actually gave us a letter, said we could use their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| but then again it's not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| All my neighbors would like to see something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| This one particular area of Clinton Highway is not in very good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| The property next door could probably be condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| That's the reason I'm buying it, so we can clean up the area a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| But this warehouse is a very important part of what we had planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| and it is a stepping stone to get farther along with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| to try and fix up the whole area in that particular area of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| But like I say, I do own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| We have had the same use in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| and we've never had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| There's always parking available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I actually own two of the old city trolleys that we use to take people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| We do our best to make sure safety is a number one course of action for us with these events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| and with whatever we do on any properties I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Is there a motion to approve the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3674)|
| 1:01:23| Seeing no motion, then this appeal fails due to the lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3683)|
| 1:01:33| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| to North Shore Wine and Spirits relative to its application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3697)|

| 1:01:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| to the agreement with Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3716)|

| 1:02:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3735)|

| 1:02:22| to Mountain View Restorations, LLC for one parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| located at 223 East Anderson Avenue within the limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| pursuant to the Homemakers Program for a contract sales price of $10,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I wonder if we have Becky here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I understand that when we do this Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| we don't get much money for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| but the goal is to get a house restored back into active use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| which contributes to the health of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Is that kind of approach being used here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| And we have a right to move back in, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| if they don't do the job of restoring the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| They have 180 days to begin construction, and then if they do not finish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| it's included in the deed that the city can take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| So we're taking a vacant house and putting it back to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Yes, it's a vacant, very blighted house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| We've worked with this group before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| They restored a house on Cornelia and sold it for over $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| and their plan is to do the same with this property that's in pretty bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| I'm going to move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| It hasn't already been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I think we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into agreement number 120112| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| with the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| to upgrade signal timing along Kingston Pike from Cherokee Boulevard to Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I spoke to Jim briefly before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| but I understand that we are doing this both on Kingston Pike and on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| in the next item or so coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Can you tell us a bit about this traffic signaling improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| And, of course, I saw Cindy here from CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| and I know that when I watch those big buses go down the street and stop at every light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| it's like trying to stop a battleship that's burning gas and brakes and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| And so is this going to help us run traffic smoothly on our streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Is that what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Yes, this should improve the flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| It's actually pretty much routine maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| Most corridors should be updated every three to five years in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| because these are state highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| The state is doing the analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| and we're going to follow up and do the work of installing the basically programming in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| Do you upgrade the electronics in those silver boxes we see to the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| or do you just program them to run differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| We just program them to run differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Are you doing this in other areas other than Broadway and Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| This is the only active project right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Do you intend in the future to catch up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Yeah, well, we intend in the future to update some of the corridors that are ours rather than the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3933)|
| 1:05:43| We're not necessarily as up on it as we could be, but it should be routine operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3943)|
| 1:05:55| So is the goal, in essence, I'm stopped at a light, the light turns green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| if I do the lawful rate of speed I should be able to proceed down the boulevard without stopping every corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| That's the general idea, but, of course, you've got traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| It's easy to set your system up so that going in, say, north, everything's synchronized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| but then south will be completely out of synchronization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| So you've got to do some optimization and some compromises to get it flowing the best in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| You also, of course, have to take into account the side streets and how they fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| There's traffic building up on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Do we have the people in-house to do this, the actual programming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| The programming, yes, we have people in-house to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| We have people who can do the study also, but we don't have enough of them to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| So the state's doing that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| The state's doing that part for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4007)|

| 1:06:50| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| I'll just ask my question without editorializing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| But, Jim, I apologize for not being able to get a hold of you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| but could you just explain the process in terms of what we're looking at as far as how the study's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| In other words, is there going to be any public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| or are the citizens going to see certain things at street corners or lights or this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| Do you have any idea how that's going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| It's strictly a matter of sitting down in front of a computer, putting the traffic volumes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| I mean, we've already counted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| We know where they're coming from, they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| They model how to get the sequence to work the best, and then they go out and put it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| It isn't the kind of thing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| It's not on-the-ground work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| It's already been done and done by the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Yeah, there's no big changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| It's just a matter of making the flow better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4059)|

| 1:09:47| Is that the ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I'd say 20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4189)|

| 1:10:01| Like $2 million or $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| About $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| When it says operating assistance, is this for fuel or is this some other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| We can use it for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| As long as it's for operating the buses on the streets, you can use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I see the answer man is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4217)|

| 1:10:22| $800,000 in fuel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| I think you had some federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Just go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| I thought you had some federal money that actually gave you a fuel allowance or fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Fuel is totally an obligation of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Well, and this state operating assistance could be applied to use towards fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| unlike federal assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4242)|

| 1:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| We're going to call on Mr. Mark Hines and Mr. David Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| I believe they want to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Mark Hines, 123 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Sorry for any confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| The city has worked very hard with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I can finally announce that Urban Outfitters is coming to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Knoxville in the RF team building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| They gave us permission today finally to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Thank you very much for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| When will they be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Spring of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Take over the space January 7th officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| Councilman, were you already on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Let me go to Councilman Dellivolpi since I think your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| I noticed that there is work going on in the Arnstein building right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Is this in anticipation of the tenant or is this just general rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| what's going on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Yeah, they're both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| We've got Barbara and Maria Architects taking the second and third floor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| We're turning that space over to them in about two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| and then we have 20 apartments on the upper floors that will be open at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| end of the year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| So we're preparing all of those tenants to move in before we turn over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Urban Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| So this is a classic mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| You've got the retail on the lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| and then you've got an office space, and then you've got residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| This building is the old Max B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Arnstein building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| and it was a department store originally with office in the upper floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| And the great news about Urban Outfitters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| they're taking the ground floor and the entire basement of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| So it's 11,000 square feet, which would be a lot of retail for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| It's a good-looking building too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| We've worked hard to get it back to its original glory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| I would just, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Do you want Mayor Brown to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Oh, I was going to ask a question about the Urban Outfitters when they do set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| up about how many people do you think they would employ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Yeah, we actually asked that question to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| They will have 30 employees full-time plus six managers and 20 seasonal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| employees, so about 56 people throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I guess, number one, congratulate you all for being able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| I guess they're more of a regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| They're international.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Oh, they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| That's the one I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| I don't believe I'll fit their clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| I'm really glad they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| I don't either, but I've got three daughters who will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| But I'm glad that they're coming to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| That's a real plus for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| And to land something of that magnitude just, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| lends itself to what's going on in the renaissance in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| So that really helps folks that are in the accruing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| You know, that's one more feather in the cap, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| So it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| But I just wanted to clarify with, I guess, with Mr. Maness or Bill, I'm not sure which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| but there was a question about loan or a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| So the way I understand the funding in this, number one, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| this is money that was accrued from loans previous to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| I see the answer man coming, but for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Our senior director of finance, Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| The joy of math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Correction on the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| It's 800,000 gallons of fuel for cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| It is several million, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| In answer, the funding for this proposal comes from our UDAG fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| And what you're doing tonight is you're appropriating $250,000 from that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| to go to this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| The UDAG fund is basically considered kind of a legacy fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| UDAG was a program that was started in the late 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| I think it was 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| It ended in 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| But during that time, the city made at least one loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| and probably several in the early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| The proceeds that are built up in this fund are from a loan for the old city hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| And because this was a federal program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| and the proceeds become program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| but they're subject to the same restrictions that apply on the federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| So these funds are restricted as to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| The program was originally initiated to try to promote economic development in blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4553)|
| 1:16:02| It was designed to promote public-private partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| And one of the things that were allowed under the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| were economic development grants or loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| And, again, in a couple of weeks, there will be a formal loan coming before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| The loan proposal is what we refer to as a forgivable loan or deferred payment loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| If typically they're set up to last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| if the tenant stays there or the borrower has use of the property for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| then the loan is totally forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| And roughly forgiven at 20 percent per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| So one year, you know, if something were to happen at the end of one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| 80 percent would still be old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| At the end of two years, 60 percent and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| And then after five years, then the loan is totally forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| But this is money, I mean, obviously it's federal money, which is taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| that originally the seed money on this, but this money here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| this is accrued interest from previous deals that we've gotten the interest back on the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| So this is repayments of principal and interest on previous loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| And, again, I've been here a long time, but this even predates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| I think the loan was probably around 81, but I could be a year or so off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| Well, again, I just, you know, I think it's a great use of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| The taxpayer, we're not writing a check, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I mean, it's been a long time since the seed money was here, but this is accrued money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| And it couldn't be a better way to invest it in our downtown to have such a banner as this comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| And I applaud the effort and, you know, certainly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Jim, as long as you're there, I'm enjoying the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I understand the concept of a forgivable loan, and it steps down 20 percent each year over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| so it goes from 250 to 200 to 150 to 100 and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| This money right now is sitting in some type of an investment vehicle earning a very modest interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| because of the kinds of things we're allowed to invest in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| Very modest is probably optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| And these dollars, once gone, won't be available to lure the next great business into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| Is there any way that we can charge a modest interest rate of several percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| and generate new dollars on this declining balance so that we have dollars at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4720)|
| 1:18:48| to invest in another business attraction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| I do not believe that you would be prohibited from doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Typically, in the loan of this type, it is just treated as a straight grant or forgivable loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| and it just amortizes it over, you know, 20 percent per year is forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| Again, I don't think you're precluded from doing that, but that would be very atypical of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| I don't think we've ever done one like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| All right, and tonight all we're doing is moving dollars from one budget into the operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| so we can act on the actual proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| What you're proposing, what you're doing tonight is amending the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and appropriating the funds so that you can go ahead and act on an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| that will be coming before you in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| We're straightening out the accounting books, so to speak, to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Yes, this is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| And, Councilman Dellavopia, I will tell you this is similar to with our facade grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| They actually are forgivable loans, and we count them as forgivable loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| and so we have a precedent for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I was happy to forget the principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I was wondering if we could get some interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| That's all I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Before we take the vote, I just want to say I am so excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you, Mark Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you, David Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| I don't know how many months ago it was that you all came to us and talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| and we are so glad that you pulled it off, that we're able to be a participant in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| having the mixed-use development with the residential, the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| and the retail is going to really be a boost to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| in line with a lot of the efforts you all have taken on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| as well as other pioneering developers who have taken a risk downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| and I think it's appropriate that we are a partner in that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| So thank you for that, and I look forward to taking my granddaughter down to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4849)|

| 1:21:41| My name is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| I live at 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee, and I wanted to take the opportunity to thank each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4902)|
| 1:21:52| I first want to tell you that my decision to retire was not a spur of the moment decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| It was not reached out of anger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| It was not reached out of anything that I was asked or told to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| I did a lot of soul searching, a lot of praying, and a lot of talking to a lot of people whose opinions I respect very highly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4927)|
| 1:22:17| I have never been more sure of any decision I have ever made in my life except for my salvation and my decision to marry my soul mate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4937)|
| 1:22:28| I have enjoyed working with each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4948)|

| 1:22:42| the administrations of this city and the citizens of this city to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4962)|
| 1:22:50| That's discluding my role as the president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| I learned a long time ago that not everybody can be told yes, but I also learned a long time ago there is an easy way to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4977)|
| 1:23:10| I learned when I took this zoning inspector job that you can only please 50 percent of the people 50 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=4990)|
| 1:23:20| So people don't understand zoning, and it is not an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| It really is not an easy job, and I want to thank you for the opportunity that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| On a personal note regarding my presidency and leadership of the City Employees League, that as well has been my honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5012)|
| 1:23:42| Every decision I have made, almost without exception, has been for the betterment of all general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5022)|
| 1:23:52| and a lot of times all city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Too many times those people who are the least paid and the hardest worked go unthanked and unrecognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5035)|
| 1:24:05| And without exception, every time I have stepped before you, it has been my goal to make things better for them first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5045)|
| 1:24:16| the least haves, and the rest of us come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| And, again, I want to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| I want to thank you for the many, many years I've had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| I may be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I hope I'm not forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| And a lot of you did not get to know the real Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| That was probably to your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| But I do thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5079)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you, Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120821?start=5094)|
