| 2:57:56| But my house, I just soon have it as a brand new one, and it's 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10676)|
| 2:58:01| But we are overstepping our bounds here, like Commissioner Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| any way you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| I talked to the law director here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| and we're possibly opening ourself up to a lawsuit from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10689)|
| 2:58:15| Now, I know it sounds like I'm talking in circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| but I was trying to get an agreement out of both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| But I see no way that we can do anything except either vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10701)|
| 2:58:30| Commissioner McKinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| Let me, and I mean this in all sincerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10718)|
| 2:58:44| is that I'd like to apologize to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| I mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| We are way out of our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| We are discussing things in gory detail that we have no jurisdiction over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| and I think we're sending a false sense out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| not just to the audience present but the folks at home that are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| that we actually have say in these matters that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| And we really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| You elect your school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| That means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| And when that school board member goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| we appoint another school board member out of the general population within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10760)|
| 2:59:26| So for us to be sitting here having this discussion today, we're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10766)|
| 2:59:31| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| But there's just been a lot of things said that I feel strongly that I need to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10774)|
| 2:59:42| First of which is everyone's my district, my area, me, me, I, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10782)|
| 2:59:51| I look at the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| When the previous commissioner was passing out libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| there were new libraries, Carter, Powell, Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| Same with the senior citizens, South Knoxville, Carter Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| The first district got a rebuild or a renovated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| Same with school systems, our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| We got renovated schools out of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| I guess the Office of Civil Rights pushed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| Am I complaining? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| Because I've been in those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| The Senior Citizens Center at John T. O'Connor, which the county made a substantial donation to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10826)|
| 3:00:33| is second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| The East Knoxville Library, second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| It may not architecturally look as great as Powell, because that really is a nice facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| but as far as a library, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| But it was a reuse of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10845)|
| 3:00:48| So just crying new every time, I think it's short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| We have to look at what's best for the entirety of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| not just the constituents within our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10857)|
| 3:01:04| Asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| If I could have the environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| Dr. McIntyre, did you say he was here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| Could I ask you a couple of really, hopefully, simple things about some of the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10870)|
| 3:01:19| One in particular is the mold and indoor air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| What's the recognized process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| Well, one, how is it generated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| How do we get mold into our indoor surfaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10890)|
| 3:01:35| I'm Rob Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| I'm the environmental supervisor for the schools, 900 East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| The mold that you would get in a building is a result of moisture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| You can have high humidity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| You can have roof leaks, plumbing leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10908)|
| 3:01:51| That's how the mold would get in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| So once that mold is in, even if you take care of the moisture with HVAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| and seal up the leaks, you'll have to do something with that mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| Well, I mean, if it's like in the case of Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| I've been out there from like 2004 to 2006 in different capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:15| Partly I was out there when I was in consulting business with Mac Tech Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:25| And then when I came on board with the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| I was out there several times for mold out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| What we had out there was some surface mold, basically the result of high humidities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| dust accumulations that got in contact with moisture, and they were easily cleanable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10965)|
| 3:02:46| So there's no reoccurring source for the mold within Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10966)|
| 3:02:53| Well, mold spores are a normal component of indoor air and outdoor air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| I mean, they're ubiquitous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:00| We're breathing in 500 to 1,000 mold spores right now per cubic meter of air probably in this building alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10980)|
| 3:03:07| So, I mean, it comes in with the fresh air intake of, you know, when doors are open, when windows are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10987)|
| 3:03:16| It's carried in on kids' clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| So, I mean, it's ubiquitous in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11001)|
| 3:03:22| So I guess my bottom line on the mold is you, being an expert, very experienced within this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11002)|
| 3:03:32| feel that mold will not be a problem at Carter Elementary once we're done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11012)|
| 3:03:37| If this $5 million project was passed, or 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11017)|
| 3:03:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11021)|
| 3:03:42| If moisture issues are controlled, then we shouldn't have a mold problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11022)|
| 3:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| Commissioner McKenzie, I'd like to apologize to the school board, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| I think Ms. Roy has done a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11036)|
| 3:03:57| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| I want to apologize to them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11038)|
| 3:03:59| They're taking an undue beating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| You know, and then I've commented on this before, and I just feel the need to comment on this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11045)|
| 3:04:13| We keep comparing ourselves to Union County and Claiborne County, and I'm sure Mr. Lloyd does a great job with his company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11053)|
| 3:04:21| They've been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| But I'd also guarantee you, if you talk to the school board within Claiborne County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11063)|
| 3:04:30| they built pretty much two identical schools, that they would have liked more, that they're not happy with those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11070)|
| 3:04:39| Not from a constructability standpoint, let me be clear, but from what Dr. McIntyre is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11079)|
| 3:04:45| a facility that meets the need of a school system that wants to be a world class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11085)|
| 3:04:54| Please, please, I'll let you go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| I'm going to need some time to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| He'll call on you when it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| That meets the need of a world class school system, which we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| You can do that with a rebuild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| Again, walk into Austin East Magna High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| The facility is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| The capabilities within that school building are second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11116)|
| 3:05:23| And I would also think that I guarantee that folks at Claiborne County, as well as Cumberland Gap, would be very envious of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11123)|
| 3:05:32| So I think we're comparing apples to oranges, and I wish we quit doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:38| throwing out a number and saying that that's a cookie cutter approach to things, that really doesn't cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:46| Could I ask a question about Amherst Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| How much did it cost to build that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| Maybe David knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| You didn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11154)|
| 3:05:55| Roughly, really rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| If you'll give me a moment, I can tell you almost exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| And roughly how many students are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| Maybe Dr. McIntyre knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| Are we talking 500, 600, somewhere in there, or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| Amherst Elementary School was built for $13,000, or $13,235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11174)|
| 3:06:22| It was bid in May of 2003, opened in August of 2005 with an 800-student capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11182)|
| 3:06:30| So in terms of, you know, this was built a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| We know things don't go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| This facility we built was $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| I don't know what district that's in, but if you walk into that facility, you know, it looks like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| So for us to throw numbers out there, you know, David Collins does a good job of architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11204)|
| 3:06:52| and I'm sure he does some estimating, but I don't think he'll do it by the seat of his pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11212)|
| 3:07:00| So, again, when we throw numbers out there like that, they tend to stick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11220)|
| 3:07:04| and I think that's not a good thing for us to do because people walk away thinking all we need is additional $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11224)|
| 3:07:11| and we can build a brand-new elementary school, and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11231)|
| 3:07:15| If we rebuild or build on a separate site an elementary, it's going to cost way more than $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11235)|
| 3:07:21| way more than $5.6 million to meet the needs that we've set forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| So a couple of other things on the other parts, Dr. McIntyre, of the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11247)|
| 3:07:35| You know, Chihaui, a school within my district, which I'm sure some people are probably taking shots at, was built in 1928,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:44| and its last renovation was in 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| Does that school, how does that compare to Carter Elementary in terms of needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11269)|
| 3:07:58| Yeah, I'm not sure I want to, you know, make a direct comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| I think what we've tried to do, again, with the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| is to assess all of our facilities across Knox County schools, see what the needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11284)|
| 3:08:09| and then apply resources to make sure that we're able to provide a great learning environment for all of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11289)|
| 3:08:18| So Chihaui, when we talked about, you know, some of the priority projects with the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11298)|
| 3:08:24| it was a recognition that there are many, I guess what you call in the industry, deficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11304)|
| 3:08:30| but are really just things that need to be fixed and things that need to be upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| and things that need to be renovated at Chihaui.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| We talked about some of the systems, some of the infrastructure, flooring, accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11317)|
| 3:08:42| So I think there's just a recognition that there's a good bit of work to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| to make sure that that building continues to be a safe, healthy, inviting learning environment for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11326)|
| 3:08:52| Gresham is very similar, I think, in terms of kind of the reason that it's on the major projects docket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11332)|
| 3:08:59| is because there's a recognition that it has some substantial needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| in order to make sure we can maintain the building as a learning environment for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11349)|
| 3:09:10| Commissioner McKenzie, you know, going back to this, you know, I said I thought it would take about 15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11350)|
| 3:09:16| but I just want to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11356)|
| 3:09:17| Point of order, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| I want to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| Point of order, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| I believe Mr. McKenzie has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11362)|
| 3:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11363)|
| 3:09:26| I'd like to, you know, and I'm not going to go on and on with this, but I guess I will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11366)|
| 3:09:36| as Commissioner Brouwer has put it very well, the school board has a track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11376)|
| 3:09:40| There is a they have data points and they have hard data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11380)|
| 3:09:45| They plan this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| This is the number they put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| And according to Mr. Dillingham, they missed the mark one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| I think that goes a long way in my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Mr. Dillingham, if you don't care, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11402)|
| 3:10:09| I was kind of looking over the schematics that Mr. Collins provided, and we're seeing net gain of four classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11409)|
| 3:10:19| but we're eliminating two classrooms to build those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| We're eliminating the classroom that's going to now be the office or near the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11424)|
| 3:10:31| You're eliminating anything that's currently a classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| We are eliminating one classroom on the lower area that will become a part of the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11433)|
| 3:10:39| But then we're going to add the four on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| We'll add four on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11442)|
| 3:10:43| We will also reclaim one classroom that is currently used for music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:51| Music will be moving into the gymnasium area adjacent to the art room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11451)|
| 3:10:58| The new administrative office will be going downstairs where the current art room is located now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11458)|
| 3:11:05| The two classrooms that are now used as a media center will be reclaimed as classroom space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11465)|
| 3:11:14| So we're actually reclaiming six classroom spaces inside the existing structure now, plus the four additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:23| Are those six reclaims, are they the size of your desired classroom for a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11483)|
| 3:11:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| Are you getting rid of any portables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| I know you've got to move them for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| My concern is two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| I came in here on the fence with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11503)|
| 3:11:46| My concern is two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| I think we are testing our boundaries with the school board, with the law director's directive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| I think we're very close to crossing over the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| And number two, if we're going to do it, if we're going to do a renovation, I'd like to look at the cost of a new school versus renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11518)|
| 3:12:09| But if we're not going to get rid of all the existing portables and still be at the number of desired students that we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11529)|
| 3:12:18| are we going to add that 50 capacity and get rid of all six portables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| There are four modulars at the elementary school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| They will all be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| So that population will be moving inside the school, plus we will have four additional classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11552)|
| 3:12:39| which will increase capacity of the facility depending on what grade of classroom they are used, between 80 and 90 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11559)|
| 3:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| But we're not going to have, when we talk about gaining classroom space, we're not gaining the square footage per child that's ideal for learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11571)|
| 3:13:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| We're increasing what we have there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| Some classrooms are going to be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:07| If we max out our capacity, then our square foot per child will be at approximately 105 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11587)|
| 3:13:19| If we, for what they have right now, which is approximately 550 students, once we do the addition renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11599)|
| 3:13:26| we will increase the square footage of the elementary facility to 68,200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:34| So that will calculate to approximately 124 square feet per child based on current population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11614)|
| 3:13:42| And I spoke with Dr. McIntyre, and I think you'll be the expert to answer this question because it confuses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11622)|
| 3:13:48| And I don't believe that a government building should be the best looking building on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11628)|
| 3:13:54| I think we ought to build what we need and not have any extras on architecture, not have any extras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11634)|
| 3:13:59| I think they ought to be square, and I think they ought to be brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11642)|
| 3:14:03| Why do we-we've designed, that I can remember, West Valley's new, Hardin Valley Elementary's new, Amherst Elementary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11643)|
| 3:14:10| Why do we have to redesign one every time we build one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| That's probably a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Why do we have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| It's-the way I try to explain it is that we live in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:24| When we design a facility, we design it for the piece of property that we're building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| It would be easy if we had relatively flat land to do a prototypical design and recreate that each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11669)|
| 3:14:37| But, for instance, you take a look at Amherst Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| If you look at the design, there are actually three levels to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| It was built down the slope versus going in and creating a flat area to put it all on one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11684)|
| 3:14:51| Is Carter flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| Not exactly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| The existing is two levels now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| But it's-topographically, is it fairly flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| I'm not talking about the new property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| I'm talking about the current school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| The current school is-there is, again, two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11708)|
| 3:15:12| You have grade entrance on both levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| So we've got-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| It kind of-it has a hillside there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| Can't we modify a design instead of redesigning everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| Again, it depends on the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| We take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| We actually have the program standards that identify each individual component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:38| classroom size, administrative office size, cafeteria size, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11738)|
| 3:15:45| And we have it for populations of 400 up to 1,200 at the elementary school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11745)|
| 3:15:51| And so we take a-we use those basic components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11751)|
| 3:15:56| and have the architect put those together to try to adapt the actual design to the site that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11756)|
| 3:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11765)|
| 3:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| Mr. Chairman, can I just add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| You know, I think Mr. Andrews makes a very good point in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11774)|
| 3:16:19| you don't want to necessarily recreate the wheel every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| And I think Mr. Dillingham and I and others have talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11781)|
| 3:16:25| And I think we're open to some opportunities to perhaps look at as we look at the new Southwest Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11785)|
| 3:16:31| perhaps doing some sort of design competition or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11791)|
| 3:16:35| Again, we're doing our homework in terms of what the law allows and what the procurement regulations allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11795)|
| 3:16:40| But perhaps then we could be more open to some modification of existing designs or things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11800)|
| 3:16:47| It is site-specific, so a lot of the architectural fees that go along with designing new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11807)|
| 3:16:52| do come around that specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| But I do want to make sure the commission understands that we're looking to be cost-effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11815)|
| 3:17:00| and fiscally responsible in everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| So we are open to that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| In fact, it's an internal conversation we're already having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11830)|
| 3:17:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| Commissioner Andrews, my father, when he was on the commission, brought up that same point back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| Why can we not have a pullout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| We want an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| We go to the cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| We pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11844)|
| 3:17:25| We need a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11845)|
| 3:17:26| We pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11846)|
| 3:17:27| We need a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11847)|
| 3:17:28| We pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11848)|
| 3:17:29| Maybe make some modifications for the topography and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11849)|
| 3:17:34| But that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| First of all, I don't think I need anybody to apologize for what I've said tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11856)|
| 3:17:42| and I take offense to anybody that said that they need to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11862)|
| 3:17:53| This is the one time of year that this body gets to talk about what's happening within the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11873)|
| 3:18:01| We are the funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| It is our fiduciary's responsibility to know where that money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11883)|
| 3:18:09| Granted, once we turn that over, the school board gets to make the final decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11889)|
| 3:18:16| But right now, it's in our court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11896)|
| 3:18:22| But I guess I have a question to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11902)|
| 3:18:26| If we need $5 million or $6 million to build a new school and we build it out on another site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11906)|
| 3:18:37| we no longer have the $1.5 million to build the middle school gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11917)|
| 3:18:43| And that's something that you all as a community are going to have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| Because if it takes all of that money, we no longer have the money for the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11928)|
| 3:18:55| And I guess I would need to hear back from the community as to how they would feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11935)|
| 3:19:01| The middle school would have to continue to play in that old gym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11941)|
| 3:19:05| because we would be using every dollar available to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11945)|
| 3:19:10| And I can sit here and cast a vote one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11950)|
| 3:19:14| but it's the folks in that community that's going to have to live with that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11954)|
| 3:19:20| So I'd like to, you know, maybe not tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11960)|
| 3:19:24| but sometime, you know, if this substitute resolution passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11964)|
| 3:19:31| then try to let this body know how you would feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| That's probably something you may not have thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| So I'm ready to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| I see there's a couple other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| But I'm ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| You know, and Mr. Law Director, I'd like to talk to you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| It's been suggested that commission is overstepping its boundaries if we vote for this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=11995)|
| 3:20:02| Now, I have sat on this commission when we overstepped our boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| and it's not a comfortable position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| In your opinion, are we overstepping our boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| Commissioner, you have to make a distinction between the plan itself and the ultimate execution of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| Now, there's precious little law on this subject, but my understanding of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12019)|
| 3:20:24| my independent research, and that combined with the research that was conducted by the county's technical advisory service, CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12024)|
| 3:20:34| leads me to the definitive conclusion that the motion is legally sound, that once you give the school board the money, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12034)|
| 3:20:44| It can't come with purse strings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| You can't sit there and say, okay, we'll give you the money if you do A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| Once they get the money, they spend it how they see fit because that's what they're designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12049)|
| 3:20:54| But until that time the money is transferred, you, I believe, have the legal authority to say we're going to give you X amount of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12054)|
| 3:21:02| go forward with your plans, we're going to hold this back until further study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| and then decide whether or not you're going to ultimately give the school board that remaining amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12066)|
| 3:21:12| Because, again, this is an aspirational plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| And I believe also Mr. Troyer, looking at it from a fiscal and accounting standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| again within the confines of what's been published on this subject, which, again, is very little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12080)|
| 3:21:25| I believe he likewise will agree that you can withhold a portion of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12085)|
| 3:21:32| But, again, if you withhold that money and then give it to them, once again, it's theirs and they're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| So if you say, okay, we're holding back $2 million, let's talk about it in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12097)|
| 3:21:41| Okay, we're giving you the $2 million, are you going to spend it on the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12101)|
| 3:21:45| They don't have to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| They give us our money and we're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12108)|
| 3:21:49| I understand completely and I appreciate your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| I always have liked the advice of a good attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12112)|
| 3:21:56| If I want advice from a used car salesman, I'll take my own advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12116)|
| 3:22:03| Anyway, I feel comfortable voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| I do want to say that I have not told you all to talk to any particular person about building a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12125)|
| 3:22:13| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12133)|
| 3:22:14| All I've done is suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| All I've done is said that there's a citizen in our community who has built award-winning schools for less in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12136)|
| 3:22:24| That's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| It's your responsibility, Mr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| It's your responsibility, school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| I'm going to vote tonight to say I'm not happy with the plan as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12151)|
| 3:22:37| I'm going to vote tonight to say I'd like for you to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| Now, if next month we may be right back in the same space we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| but I would hope that you would take the 30 days to look at this plan, to look at the other possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12166)|
| 3:22:53| to look, tour some of these other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12173)|
| 3:22:56| And, Mr. McKenzie, if you'd like to take a trip, we can sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12176)|
| 3:23:01| I'm willing to drive up to Claiborne County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12184)|
| 3:23:05| You may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| But I'm willing to tour these other schools with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12186)|
| 3:23:10| And maybe, Mr. McIntyre, so we can have a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12190)|
| 3:23:13| I just think that now is a time, and this is not, we're looking at this as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12193)|
| 3:23:19| This is not a problem, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| This is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| This is an opportunity to get out of this box that we're stuck in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| It's an opportunity for us to communicate with each other, again, knowing that the school board has the ultimate responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12207)|
| 3:23:34| But it is an opportunity for us to attempt to influence them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12214)|
| 3:23:40| It's an opportunity for them to get out of the box and look at things another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12220)|
| 3:23:44| Because if there is a way to give this community a new school, I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12224)|
| 3:23:50| And I'm ready to vote, so I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| I need to ask a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| My light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12236)|
| 3:23:57| Well, he didn't get a second, so Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12237)|
| 3:24:03| Yes, Doug, would you mind coming up just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12243)|
| 3:24:09| Mr. McKenzie, I want to tell you right now, the school system builds top quality schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12249)|
| 3:24:13| They're way above the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Doug, Dogwood Elementary, how old is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12255)|
| 3:24:19| Approximately ten, maybe 11 years old, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:22| Who oversaw the construction of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12262)|
| 3:24:26| That was before my tenure on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| I believe it's PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12269)|
| 3:24:30| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| I think they had some oversight in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| I believe David Collins could probably relate to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| It was built in 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| I believe PVA oversaw the construction of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| Now, my understanding is this is what I'm wanting to tell you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| And I could be wrong, but I stand to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| It has been a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| There's moisture problems in it so bad the doors won't shut hardly and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| PVA handled that was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| And the school system wouldn't sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| So when we build a school, we have to be sure that it's built properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12304)|
| 3:25:09| And we can't just take these low bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| Now, I just don't believe, like I said, in Lumpy you can holler point of order or anything you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12311)|
| 3:25:18| that we can build a school for $5 million to the standards that Knox County builds their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12318)|
| 3:25:23| And like I said, I would be willing to go to $8 million, but we can't build it for $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| I said I thought it would take at least $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| Well, they just come up with Amherst $13 million down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| And, Doug, did that include buying the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12334)|
| 3:25:40| No, sir, that did not include property purchase, but it did include site development costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| Of course, I realize we own property up there, but we don't own anything like 24 acres, I'd say, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:52| Straw Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12352)|
| 3:25:53| I believe it's around the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| But we can't build a quality school that we desire for any $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12357)|
| 3:26:01| Now, let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:02| Go look at some of these million-dollar houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12362)|
| 3:26:05| Do you think that they stand to anything or two or three million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| Look anything like a school and we'll take the punishment that a school has and needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12368)|
| 3:26:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12373)|
| 3:26:14| We can't build a school for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12374)|
| 3:26:16| That's fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| I'm going to have to go with the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12384)|
| 3:26:25| Doug, let me ask about the Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12385)|
| 3:26:29| You said you gave a number a moment ago about what the proposed square feet is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12389)|
| 3:26:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| $55,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12399)|
| 3:26:40| The total, once we do an addition renovation, will be 68,200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12400)|
| 3:26:50| And it's 34 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| It's going to double?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12414)|
| 3:26:55| About 35,000, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12415)|
| 3:26:56| It's going to double?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| Well, you have to keep in mind that the existing middle school gymnasium now becomes a part of the elementary school square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12417)|
| 3:27:10| That really helps in classroom instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| It will include art room, music room, as well as the PE area, which is basically pretty much in line with our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12433)|
| 3:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12446)|
| 3:27:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| I kind of missed something a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| We were talking about when certain schools were renovated or what the point might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12453)|
| 3:27:40| And maybe this is back to who, Commissioner Broyles, who prepared this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12460)|
| 3:27:46| Where does this form come from that tells us when buildings were built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12466)|
| 3:27:50| I requested this from Indykin Cannon and from Dr. McIntyre over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| They emailed it at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12475)|
| 3:27:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12478)|
| 3:27:59| They emailed it to us today, this morning, and I opened it right before we came in for our meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12479)|
| 3:28:08| So maybe, Dr. McIntyre, can you tell us where you came up with this list, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12488)|
| 3:28:13| Mr. Chairman, the document was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| Let me ask a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| That way we'll get on through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| The Carter Elementary, it says like 1938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12499)|
| 3:28:24| How many rooms are still existing at Carter Elementary that were built in 1938?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12504)|
| 3:28:31| I don't know the answer to that question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| I can have Mr. Dillingham answer if he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| The document itself was prepared by our facilities department in a discussion with the school board several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12515)|
| 3:28:42| So it was a document that we had prepared, and Commissioner Broyles and others were interested in that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12522)|
| 3:28:51| So it was transmitted to all of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12531)|
| 3:28:54| Actually, at the top of the first page, it says updated August 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12534)|
| 3:29:00| Right, but how many rooms at Carter Elementary are of the 1938 vintage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12540)|
| 3:29:09| And does this mean that, for example, I'll just pick someone else off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12549)|
| 3:29:15| Austin East Magnet High was built in 1951.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12555)|
| 3:29:21| Are all the 1951 rooms still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12561)|
| 3:29:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| Then I want to compare it to, I'm just trying to get a feel for, like, Fountain City Elementary, it says 1931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12568)|
| 3:29:36| Are all the 1931s that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| You've got some flat tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12579)|
| 3:29:42| But you've got a bunch of flat tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| I'm beginning to see that, I wonder how many, when you say you're built, is that when they broke ground and built the first room there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12584)|
| 3:29:54| And are those rooms still there, or have they been in subsequent renovations, maybe like at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12594)|
| 3:30:01| I can tell you, Dave, that in the case of, like, Beaumont Magnet Elementary, it was built in 1936, and it was renovated in 1943, 1953, and 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12601)|
| 3:30:18| Right, and I can read that off the form also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| Is 1936 rooms, are they still all there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| Yes, and they're still being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| Okay, and that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| I think most of the renovations are, classrooms are added, additions are made, and so there are more classrooms added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12627)|
| 3:30:36| but most of the original classrooms and structure are still used and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12636)|
| 3:30:45| And I'll say that, you know, Beaumont, this past year, added two flat tops to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12645)|
| 3:30:52| So we also have outdoor classrooms now at Beaumont, but it was built in 1936 and has been renovated three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12652)|
| 3:31:01| Commissioner, the document was developed to simply answer the question, when were individual school facilities built and when were they renovated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12661)|
| 3:31:09| And so I'm not sure the document itself answers your questions about which sections of the building were renovated or which ones were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12669)|
| 3:31:16| or which rooms are original and which ones are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| It's simply an attempt to answer the question which has been asked by the school board and then subsequently by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12678)|
| 3:31:23| when were each of our school facilities built and when were they last renovated, or when were they renovated in their history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12683)|
| 3:31:29| Right, and I understand that, and I think you understand my question then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12689)|
| 3:31:33| The date that the school was established, is that the year built, and are the rooms that were built then still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12693)|
| 3:31:42| That was my question, and that's a question that's been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12702)|
| 3:31:45| Yes, they are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| Commissioner, the answer to the question of what does it mean when it says year built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12708)|
| 3:31:56| it simply means the year the school was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| In terms of are all of the rooms still existing that were built in the original construction in each of our facilities that are on that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12718)|
| 3:32:06| I can't answer that question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| That would require additional research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| I think Commissioner Broyles was trying to say that that might be the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| I said that in Beaumont's case, I know that a lot of the original classrooms are still used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12733)|
| 3:32:19| and a lot of the original facility is still being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12739)|
| 3:32:22| Beaumont is the only school that I know of that for certain I can't answer to the other 93 schools that are on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12742)|
| 3:32:31| I just know about Beaumont for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| Bonnie Kate and Moreland Heights both are still using their rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12753)|
| 3:32:38| Yes, and if you want to pull Fairgard now, it's built in 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12758)|
| 3:32:41| All of those 1916 spaces are still being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| I mean, they're built around the place, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| So I don't think we can give you a definitive answer, but I think it's an overwhelming percentage of these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| the year built, those structures are still being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12773)|
| 3:32:57| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12777)|
| 3:32:58| That was my question because I wanted to understand the form completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| The Carter Elementary comparison to the Austin East Magnet, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12782)|
| 3:33:08| when I look at Carter Elementary, built in 1938, renovated in 1948, 55, 60, and 63, or 83, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12788)|
| 3:33:23| The column is headed additions, renovations, and I don't know that anything was done to those in 1938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12803)|
| 3:33:32| And I think we've also heard earlier that, well, we've only had a $200,000 exploration of what might be needed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12812)|
| 3:33:44| and I added the word foundations to the list of things that we may be expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12824)|
| 3:33:51| The thing that has really happened to me in this discussion is that we went from trying to look and focus at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12831)|
| 3:34:01| and we're talking about everything else in Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12841)|
| 3:34:05| And while we're sitting here, my form for the actual additions and renovations to elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12845)|
| 3:34:15| has gone from $2,210,000 to $2,170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12855)|
| 3:34:25| The money that's going to be spent at Carter Elementary on the renovation has gone down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12865)|
| 3:34:36| because I'm working from a piece of paper that's 30 days old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12876)|
| 3:34:46| I'm at a loss is how we got away from discussing Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12886)|
| 3:34:52| and can everything that I named out a couple hours ago be performed on that location for $2,170,000 or $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12892)|
| 3:35:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| I think as far as the foundation goes, didn't you say, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12921)|
| 3:35:27| that the structural engineer has already been through and has signed off that the foundation is sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12927)|
| 3:35:38| Commissioner, what I said was that as part of the original preliminary design and conceptual design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12938)|
| 3:35:43| a structural engineer was part of that process with the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12943)|
| 3:35:46| Mr. Collins is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12946)|
| 3:35:47| Probably a better question for him, but my understanding is that a structural engineer did an assessment of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12947)|
| 3:35:53| and we believe the structure is sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| I understand that something has to happen for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12956)|
| 3:36:05| Absolutely something has to happen for Carter, but the reason I'm looking at the entire list of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12965)|
| 3:36:14| is because we aren't only responsible for only Carter and what Carter needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12974)|
| 3:36:19| We're responsible for what everyone in the county needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12979)|
| 3:36:25| Also, I want to reiterate that the school board is the one who decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12985)|
| 3:36:35| who makes the budget and sets the priorities based on their own experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:43| what they think is necessary and needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13003)|
| 3:36:49| I don't think that we should, and this is a term that you all love to use from time to time, micromanage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13009)|
| 3:37:01| The school board representatives have been elected from their communities to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13021)|
| 3:37:08| We are the funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| It is true that of the 94 schools on this list, which was prepared in August of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:20| over one quarter of those schools are as old or older than Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13040)|
| 3:37:27| that over 70% of them have been renovated at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:33| and 60% of those have had multiple renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13053)|
| 3:37:37| and that the school board has done 146 total renovations on school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13057)|
| 3:37:45| I've asked how many times they've had cost overruns once in Mr. Dillingham's tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13065)|
| 3:37:52| So I feel like the school board knows what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| and it's inappropriate for us to come in and attempt to micromanage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13076)|
| 3:38:01| I think we do need to have a better, more open dialogue with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13081)|
| 3:38:06| and I hope that we can do that all during the year, not just at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13086)|
| 3:38:11| But I am concerned, I'm very concerned about the precedent we may be setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13091)|
| 3:38:20| and the lawsuits we may be opening ourselves up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13100)|
| 3:38:26| by trying to second-guess all of the work that the school board has put into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13106)|
| 3:38:32| But there's not a single person here who doesn't want what's best for the children of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13112)|
| 3:38:41| And I understand that the Carter parents, their main concern are the children at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13121)|
| 3:38:47| and I understand and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| But our concern has to be for all of the children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13130)|
| 3:38:57| I'll make this very brief. I don't believe anybody else has their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13140)|
| 3:39:01| I didn't see them, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| I want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13145)|
| 3:39:08| The school board says what they need is $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13148)|
| 3:39:13| You've got to commend them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13153)|
| 3:39:16| They could ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13156)|
| 3:39:17| They say they can do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| There's not anyone up here, an architect, an engineer, a construction worker, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13160)|
| 3:39:25| But I want you to keep in mind now, I want you to keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13165)|
| 3:39:31| Miss Kincannon, of course I knew it and everybody here knows it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| but you need to keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| And the law director have told you we can give them any amount of money they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| We can give them $100 million for that school, but they can spend it the way they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13181)|
| 3:39:46| But what they're saying is to make that a nice school up there, all they need is $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13186)|
| 3:39:54| So why do we want to give them more money when they haven't asked for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13194)|
| 3:39:58| And then we can't tell them how to spend it if we give them more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| It doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13202)|
| 3:40:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13204)|
| 3:40:09| Just, again, for a little moment of refocus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13209)|
| 3:40:13| this is about Carter and the amount of money that we're spending at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13213)|
| 3:40:17| The precedent that's being set, I guess, if the school board's asking for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13217)|
| 3:40:25| and they're doing it in the form of saying where they're going to spend that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13225)|
| 3:40:29| and they're wanting us to approve it and raise it for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| if you have the expectation that we vote for their capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13233)|
| 3:40:39| and they go do something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13239)|
| 3:40:45| I do not see any precedent being set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13245)|
| 3:40:49| except for the fact we can't trust them to come and tell us what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| That's the purpose of the meeting tonight in the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| is for them to present where they are spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13258)|
| 3:41:02| and for us to agree and go get that money for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:08| If we want to turn around and say we can hold up whatever we're holding up, $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13268)|
| 3:41:17| that would have been spent on Carter, well, they may, according to your logic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13277)|
| 3:41:22| leave here tonight with the capital plan and go fix Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| and cut $5 million somewhere else because they have the authority to go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13286)|
| 3:41:31| I would submit to you they're breaking their bond of trust with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13291)|
| 3:41:36| that they've got to go do what they come in here and say they need this money to go do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13296)|
| 3:41:41| and we have to have that discussion with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| This is the one time a year we have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13304)|
| 3:41:47| The rest of the year we don't have any oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13307)|
| 3:41:51| We expect them, I expect them to do their best, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13311)|
| 3:41:55| I do not expect them to work miracles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| but I do expect them to be able to perform what they have purposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13318)|
| 3:42:05| and I raise the question that will 2.175 fix Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13325)|
| 3:42:15| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13335)|
| 3:42:18| That's the belief in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| It's the belief of three or four emails that I have from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13341)|
| 3:42:24| that I would think should have a fairly good handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13344)|
| 3:42:28| You see, we've knocked this from being a $5 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13348)|
| 3:42:33| to just slightly over $2 million, the part that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13353)|
| 3:42:39| So I'm through. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13359)|
| 3:42:47| I'll be very brief and then I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13367)|
| 3:42:52| This is kind of like deja vu because when we talk about establishing precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13372)|
| 3:42:57| the reason that we have a new high school in Knox County is because the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| down at Farragut High School got fed up and said we're tired of the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13381)|
| 3:43:06| We're tired of the fact that our kids are on top of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13386)|
| 3:43:10| There has to be something that we can do in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13390)|
| 3:43:13| The parents got together and started holding public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13393)|
| 3:43:16| The parents got together with the school board, the commission, and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13396)|
| 3:43:19| and said we can do better. What can we do? Let's make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| It was stressful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| I mean there were some tense moments between the school board and this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| I was there. I know. We were talking about building a high school for 1,100 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| And the school board said no, we can't do that. We need to go ahead and build it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| Well, we built it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| Next year, third year, Hardin Valley Academy is going to be coming close to capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| But we worked through it and we were able to sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13423)|
| 3:43:48| but my point is it started with the parents and the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13428)|
| 3:43:51| Same thing with Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| I told you the story of how they invited us down for lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| and how we had these students come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| It was the parents who came in and said we need improvements to this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13439)|
| 3:44:03| They were the driving force behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| They were the ones that went to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| Those were the ones that went to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| They brought us all together and we sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| We worked it out. Yes, it was tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| And yes, we had some disagreements, but we worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| And now Cedar Bluff has got a nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13456)|
| 3:44:19| I say to you, the reason we're here tonight is not because of the politicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13459)|
| 3:44:23| but because of the parents and the people in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13463)|
| 3:44:26| They're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13466)|
| 3:44:28| They 300 strong went to a meeting, 200 strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13468)|
| 3:44:31| They're saying we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13471)|
| 3:44:34| And so I'm saying let's give them that opportunity to sit down again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13474)|
| 3:44:38| with the school board and do what we did with the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| with Cedar Bluff and some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| Yes, there will be tense moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| I'm not afraid of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| This is what we're here for, is to vote on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| And yes, I'm not telling them how to spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| I'm saying let's go through this same process and let's try to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13491)|
| 3:44:55| And if we can, everybody is going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| And we'll sit here a year from now and say, yes, it was stressful, but we did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13502)|
| 3:45:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13505)|
| 3:45:11| We have a substitute motion on the floor to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| Mr. Chair, you have the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13515)|
| 3:45:18| Actually, we have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| It's been properly seconded, and we can't discuss it until we vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13520)|
| 3:45:25| We can turn down the call and then we'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| I just thought we ought to give respect to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| I understand, but that's as long as he has the rules that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13530)|
| 3:45:34| He was about to vote on the substitute motion, not the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| We're voting on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| No, we're going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| I didn't see any other lights, but we're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| Normally when there's no other lights, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| We're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| We're voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13550)|

| 3:47:38| just wanted to address one issue, and that is, you know, the question was, are we confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13658)|
| 3:47:44| that we can make the appropriate fixes for the dollars that we have budgeted for Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=13664)|
