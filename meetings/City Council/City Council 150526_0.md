| 0:01:51| had a great holiday weekend and enjoyed Memorial Day and of course remembered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| the whole purpose for Memorial Day. I was out at the Fountain City Day in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| Park as many of council members were and other elected officials. As always it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| a great crowd and our Councilman Dela Volpe was recognized by the Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| City group there and so we congratulate you, Councilman Dela Volpe. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=133)|
| 0:02:22| But something else that happened last week I do want to mention is that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| all know that one of our police officers was shot in the line of duty. Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Jimmy Wilson was leading the search for a fugitive at a hotel on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| This is of course what we all fear, this type of incident, and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| we train our officers every day to prepare them for something like this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| I asked Chief Roush if he would give us an update on how Officer Jimmy Wilson is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Thank you, Mayor, and of course I want to thank the community. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| some wonderful outreach from the community, everyone checking on Jimmy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| and giving them their support and their prayers. I talked to Jimmy today, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| saw him out at the range. He was out re-qualifying just to make sure that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| still got it. But he's doing good. He was cleared by medical today and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| he'll be back to work tomorrow, back on his regular post and back serving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| community. But Jim's doing really well and we thank everyone for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| concerns and their prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=208)|
| 0:03:37| All right, so looking out a few weeks, coming up on Wednesday, June 10th, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| have our annual business breakfast, which starts at 730 a.m. at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| This is an event that is put on every year by our purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Our purchasing agent, he and his staff host this and all the department heads and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| lot of city staff are there as well. What this does is give local businesses a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| preview of the goods and services that the City of Knoxville plans to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| during the coming year. So it's a great chance for both large and small vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| business people, to hear about upcoming city needs and projects that they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| be able to bid on or work with us on. Not everything goes to bid. Some of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| can be decided without a bid. So it's good to come in and to network to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| know what the goods and services are that we're looking for and to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| know the department heads so you can get yourself in front of them and we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| that you're out there and wanting to get the work. It also gives businesses a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| chance to network with each other as well and sometimes a small company can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| find a larger contractor to team up with as a subcontractor on a project. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| it's a very useful day. We usually have a pretty good turnout. This year we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| about 55 million dollars in city contracts coming up or city goods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| services that we'll be purchasing. So we want our local companies to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| compete for that and we like to hire local as much as we can. We don't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| exclusively but we like to encourage and also women and minority-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| veteran-owned businesses, we encourage all of them to come out and to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| know it and to be available to provide services. So again I'll spread the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| to any local business owners please that the event will be Wednesday, June 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| from 730 a.m. to 1130 a.m. at the Civic Coliseum. And I now would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| recognize, we have some special guests with us, State Representative Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Daniel is here along with members of the Testerman family I believe are here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| our State Senator Becky Duncan Massey and Representative Daniel is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| come on down the family, family members come on down. You all know that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| recognized Mayor Testerman before he passed with the the renaming of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| Tyson complex, tennis complex, to the Kyle Testerman tennis complex and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| Representative Daniel and Senator Massey are going to talk about a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| the state legislature also honored Mayor Testerman. Thank you, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Mayor. Senator Becky Massey and I are here tonight on behalf of the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| General Assembly. On April 22nd the General Assembly passed a resolution in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| honor of Kyle Testerman and that resolution is number 408. As you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| Kyle Testerman was a former City Council person and former mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| Knoxville and his accomplishments for many and of significant nature but if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| may, I know we're on a tight schedule, but if I may I'll just read a few parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| the resolution that was passed. Whereas Mr. Testerman, Mr. Testerman was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=411)|
| 0:07:00| born and raised in Knoxville where he lived for most of his life. A talented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| athlete, he was a member of the Knoxville High School 1951 state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| championship basketball team. He attended the University of Tennessee on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| basketball scholarship and finished his college experience on a tennis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| scholarship. Whereas Kyle Testerman's true athletic passion was for tennis and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| he co-founded the Knoxville Racquet Club and was instrumental in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| of the tennis course at Tyson Park. In his later years he was honored by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| city with the dedication and renaming of the facility as the Kyle C. Testerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Tennis Complex at Tyson Park. Whereas he was a business leader and lawyer but his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| greatest pride was being a dedicated public servant. From 1969 through 1971| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| Mr. Testerman served on the Knoxville City Council and in 1972 he became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| Knoxville's youngest elected mayor winning his first term at the age of 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| He was elected to a second term in 1984. Whereas Mr. Testerman felt his most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| significant accomplishment on a public office was the consolidation of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| and county public school systems. Also among his notice notable achievements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| are the rescue from closure and revitalization of the Knoxville Zoo. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=502)|

| 0:08:55| Assembly of the state of Tennessee, the Senate concurring, that we honor the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| memory of Kyle Copenhaver Testerman reflecting fondly upon his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| impeccable character and his stalwart commitment to living the examined life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| with courage and conviction. I have House Resolution number 408 that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| signed by Governor Haslam, Speaker Harwell, and Speaker Ramsey. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=560)|
| 0:09:29| present this to the family of Kyle Testerman. Here with us tonight are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=569)|

| 0:09:42| Janet Long Testerman-Crossley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=582)|
| 0:10:03| I just want to thank Senator Massey, Representative Daniel, for this distinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| honor. For Mayor O'Hara, for City Council, for all of you who helped pass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Tyson Park-Kyle Testerman Complex. It was really a remarkable day for him. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| very special as that was probably one of his last days that he really recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| and cherished. And I just want to thank all of you for that, for being an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| advocate for him and recognizing him as having such a love affair with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| of Knoxville. So, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. He would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| very proud. We appreciate all of y'all. Thank you very much. Members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=644)|

| 0:10:58| rock star for our dad. We appreciate that. And this is a great honor for our dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| and like my sister said, the dedication to Tyson Park was probably the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| thing he remembered and the last thing he was excited about. And I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| probably a week before that took place, every day he was telling everybody he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| was going to Tyson. He was ready to go. He was at the front door. So, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=682)|

| 0:16:22| timer going here. Hi, I'm Kim Trent, Executive Director of Knox Heritage. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| live at 516 Carter Road. There's a perverse appropriateness for me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| here tonight. We had today a huge example of why this ordinance is important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| the city. I received a text at about 1.30 that demolition had started on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Christenberry House. Unbeknownst to anyone in the community or at Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Heritage, I guess the person who gave me the permit is the one who knew and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| people who picked it up. This really shows that if there had been time to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| down and talk with the new owners, there were so many ways to save that house. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| many people who wanted to save it. We want them to build their dream house on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| the river and be a part of the community. They have no use for the house that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| faces the street that is what the community sees every day on one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| most beautiful streets in our city that we show off when people come to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| because of the historic character and the well-maintained buildings. So today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| really, for me, showed why this is so important. If we had had time to sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| we might have found a solution. We had 45 days to save the 500 block of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| and we managed to pull it off. And the city benefited, and building owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| benefited, the taxpayers benefited, and it's a vibrant part of our city. So these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| things are not impossible to achieve. All it takes is a little time and if in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| end we can't come to an agreement, they can still exercise their right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| demolish their property. But it is the most frustrating thing in the world to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| see a permanent act take place to solve a temporary problem. So I completely urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| you to vote for this ordinance and I don't know if it was a sign from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| somewhere today with a demolition of this incredible house that we can all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| see very clearly how important it is to the city going forward. And I invite you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| to read the citizen responses on our Facebook page. There are dozens and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| dozens and dozens, probably a few hundred by now, of people expressing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| regret over this and asking why could there not be another answer. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| encourage you to vote for this ordinance. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1124)|

| 0:20:39| could to ask Gwen Earl to come forward and talk just a moment about this. In my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1239)|

| 0:24:58| city would assume no additional response or expense rather. And so this is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| bring before you tonight. Your 3-1-1 program is regarded as the best in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| nation. Your call center here is, ours is excellent, and we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| align with that. So we are asking through CAC that we partner with 3-1-1. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| would open up our 2-1-1 services to the 865 area code, all nine counties. Happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| to take a question. Thank you, Ben. Councilman Dallavopi? Yeah, maybe you can just fill us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| How does CAC get involved in the actual operation of the call center? We've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| dealing with Russ Jensen and his crew, and they do a great job, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| and just want to know how they're doing and what their role is going to be. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| it's a great question. CAC will actually manage the collection of data. A call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| center is really only as good as your ability to respond with current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| information. You have to stay on top of it, and they have a part-time individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| that has been doing that work for us that would stay on in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| So they're doing it for the 2-1-1 part of it? They're going to do it for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| operation? Yes. And you collect the data, and what do you do with it? What does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| that base become? Well, it could actually help all of us. It could be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| ongoing community needs assessment. We could tell you, we aspire to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| tell you, that on a particular day, here's what people are needing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| here's where they reside, the nature of the need, and how they were ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| helped. It's a great demographic tool, and we'll get to that point. This is for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| one-year contract. You look for trends and activities that need to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Absolutely. Assessment beyond putting out the initial fire is broader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| It can ultimately be a real-time demographic understanding of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| where real need lies and how we respond as a community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you, Ben. All right, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered. 11C is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to award a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| total of $22,900 in Neighborhood Small Grants Program grants to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| community building activities planned by 12 neighborhood organizations in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| city. Move for approval. Second. Councilman Della Vopi. Yeah, I see that David Massey is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| and this is a great program. This enables communities to pull together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| their sweat equity and fundraising abilities and get things done, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| maybe you can tell us just a bit about the Neighborhood Grant Program, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| it really does help small community groups get good things done in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| neighborhoods. Thank you, Councilman David Massey, 400 Main Street. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| program that was originated many years ago by the East Tennessee Foundation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| beginning, I think, a little bit before 2009, before my time here, the city began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| supporting that program, and we did that when I came in. Mayor O'Hara was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| Director of Community Development, and we worked out a three-year situation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| the East Tennessee Foundation to fund their program, and then we suspended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| in 2012 in order to devote more attention to things like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Neighborhood Conference and our Leadership Training Program, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| really very proud now to bring that back, but now completely under the, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| work of the Office of Neighborhoods, and it is really a way for us to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| needs in neighborhood organizations. We try to combine this, not only doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| neighborhood improvement projects, but also building the capacity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| neighborhood organizations. The purposes of the program revolve around capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| building within neighborhoods and getting more people involved in community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| improvement projects, and so we're proud to bring it back. We actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| tonight with us, and I'm going to ask them to stand, approximately 18 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| from at least six of the 12 organizations, if you all would stand, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| are here with us tonight, so we really appreciate, we really appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1772)|
| 0:29:41| efforts that they have brought already to this, and that they will bring over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| the next year to these projects, and this, I think, is just the beginning. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| expect to announce later this summer another round of grant making under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| program, and also while I'm up here, I might also, for your next resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| thank Wayne Blasius of the East Tennessee Community Design Center, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| is going to be providing physical sponsorship services for a number of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| grantees, and we really appreciate the design center helping us on this. While| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| you're still there and you're talking about the design center, that really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| a help, because a lot of these neighborhood groups don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| formal 5013, you know, C3 or C4 designation, or they don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| wherewithal to keep up with that, and having them as a sponsor really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| helps these groups get the job done. I just think the number one thing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| this program is that you build communities when people get involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| hands-on projects, and I think it's a great thing for the city to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you very much. Thank you, David. Thanks to you and to Debbie and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| office, and thanks to all the neighborhood leaders who have applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| and are doing such great work in the neighborhoods. We appreciate you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| much. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11d is a resolution authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| the mayor to execute an agreement with East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| to act as fiscal sponsor for Neighborhood Small Grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| program recipients. Move to approve. Second. We have a motion and a second. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| ordered. 11e is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| behalf of the city of Knoxville necessary to purchase a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| sidewalk easement within certain real property located at 514| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| West Jackson Avenue from John L. Sanders and Brandon F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| Pace for $895 as part of the Jackson Avenue Streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Move to approve. Second. Councilman Gallivovi. Yeah, Jim Hagerman, could you tell us what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| this overall project is going to cost? This is a first phase, I guess, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| getting some of the land rights. Do you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| sense of the overall cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| It's going to be right at a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Okay, and how long is the the acquisition phase going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| We hope to start construction in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| so that includes acquisition and bidding the project out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| But this is the first of about 14 right-of-ways or easements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Closer to nine. I took a second look at it. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| so you'll be seeing more of this council for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| Great. Anything else on that? Okay, we have a motion and a second. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| ordered. 11f is a resolution acknowledging and expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1950)|

| 0:33:04| with an initial purchase of five buses in the first year at a cost not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| exceed $629,940. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| Councilman Dalibopi. I just want to thank Don and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| administration for looking at this way of sort of pooling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| resources so that we can save money in purchasing buses. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| we do it all the time and this is a great way to serve the rate payers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| and the riders at a minimal cost. I understand from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Don that we're buying five now and we have the right to buy others but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| we don't necessarily have the obligation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| buy others. It's our call. Is that correct, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Thank you. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11h is a resolution authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| the mayor to execute an agreement of sale to purchase property located at 1201| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| East Magnolia Avenue for a purchase price of $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Moved to approve. Second. Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Yeah, I hope David hasn't left yet. He's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| One of the things that I thought we ought to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| is the traffic calming. As I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I guess the first year budget, there's $20,000. It looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| mostly education and training and there has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| been talk for over a year about the need to sort of resume some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| speed bumps and circles and deterrence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| excessive speeding in neighborhoods. The budget and the actual plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| goes out another five years doesn't seem to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| much more than the $20,000 a year. Can you tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| what your cost experience was in the past in order to build the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| that these things do? Yeah, I don't know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| experience in the past. I know that some of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| has not all been spent. So there's a little bit, there's more than just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| $20,000 that would be available for traffic calming engineering if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| decide to go back and to do that. We're still looking at that. It is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| a decision that we have made. Jeff Branum, the Chief Traffic Engineer, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| have been meeting about it. There's a lot that goes into this. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| of the things that we're concerned about is that we don't want to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| and you know speed humps, which everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| wants. It's not something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| it can be very controversial. If we do it again, we want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| right. We don't want to just go in and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| speed humps in a neighborhood and then leave that neighborhood and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| somewhere else. It requires a lot of attention over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| This is something that's very difficult just the way subdivisions were developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| with a lot of parallel streets and so forth. You can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| speed humps on one street, but that just moves traffic to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| street. So it really requires a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| creativity and staff time. So I think we're at a point in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Office of Neighborhoods where we probably have that staff time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| but I don't know that that's true in engineering at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So we are still looking at that and we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| grappling with all of the things that would have to go into it. We absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| recognize how important it is and we also recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| it is something that requires all three elements. Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| meaning a lot of public education, engineering, and enforcement. We are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| the enforcement now and the KPD continues to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| on a rotating basis across the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| And Bill Cole with traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| continues to be available to go out to neighborhoods and talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| about the limited things that we can do now. And you had a series of meetings a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| year ago where you were inviting neighborhoods to come and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Is this about this resolution? What are you talking about? No, I was going to ask him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| about the 20,000. Are we talking? I hope we're talking. We're on 8, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| We're on 8. God help us. I thought I was on 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Well, since I've got them, let's just take one more minute. Let's go ahead and finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| since we've gotten this far. The question really is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| with $20,000, and I apologize, I thought we were on this item. I know you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| working on it. Do we need more money in the budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| you to actually implement more than the training and education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| I think if we get to the point where we are ready to take this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| to the administration to say we want to do this program, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| provide the administration with two or three different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| based primarily on cost, and we'll select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| which ones work. But do we have enough money in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| right now to get something going? If we were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| say start a pilot project, the answer to that is yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Okay, thank you. Sorry, Mayor. I thought we were on 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| Just ahead pretty quickly. Okay, we'll get to 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Okay, but we are on 11H, which is the purchase of East Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| the 1201 East Magnolia. I'm sticking with my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| We do have a motion and second, right? All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2307)|

| 0:39:50| dollars to construct the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Pedestrian slash Bicycle Bridge. So moved. Second. Councilman, I'll go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| Saunders first. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| This has been being, it's been batted around for several years as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| long before I got here and probably some of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Kind of flesh out where we are, if we can, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| So, Michelle, yeah, kind of flesh out where we are, kind of where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| with this, university participation, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| and the cost. I thought the cost was a bit lower than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| initially. Well, good evening, Mayor, members of Council and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Dawn Michelle Foster, Deputy Director, Office of Redevelopment. What we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| here tonight is we're applying for a grant application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| going through that process for construction of the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Pedestrian Bridge. Back in 2006, you all know, that was part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| of a public improvement project as part of the South Waterfront Vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Plan to provide connectivity. When Secretary Foxx was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| it was an honor to have him here earlier in the month to talk about public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| infrastructure and those funding dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| needing to be available. However, right before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| earlier in April, he announced the TIGER grant application process was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| opening. What we did as far as this public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| improvement, we looked at capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| projects on a large scale. The criteria is they're hard to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| You need to seek funding for these projects. You were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| talking earlier about the cost. Back in 2009, those dollars were estimated at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| $20 million. Now, when we go back and talk to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| design consultants, steel is costly, concrete is costly, man-hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| labor, all that involved in the construction of a pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| The scale and magnitude is estimated about $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| We thought this was a great project to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| move forward with. It's a very competitive grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Most of the grants that you see have to clear environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| processes. So what happened here, we had a grant back in 2009 to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| with environmental documentation and preliminary engineering. We cleared that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| hurdle back in September of 2014, got it into job completion in January of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| year. So in April, this announcement was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| for the TIGER grant. So we thought it was a great opportunity looking around at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| other large-scale projects and having an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| environmental hurdle jump. We thought it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| a great one to put through this competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Is the university participating in this? We have talked to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| university as a partnership. Like most, even the private developers, when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| ask about that site, that area there, they want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| what has the city moved forward on as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| the cost of the bridge. The university has said they will sign a letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| support for our grant proposal. Once you get, you know, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| we, like she said, we've been moving forward on it, right, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| environmentals and such. So it's kind of hard to go and negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| with landowners and the university until you've got the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| at least a significant amount of money on it. So what we're saying here is if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| can come up with 24 million dollars of a 30 million dollar bridge, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| we're starting to cook on this a little bit, you know, and then we make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| decision, do we move forward on it? And we're who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| are partners and what will they invest? But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| until you've got some money to at least, you know, a significant amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| then it's kind of hard to really negotiate exactly who will do what and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| how it'll be done. Yes, and that's our maximum amount that we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| However, USDOT would determine what amount that they would award and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| whatever that award amount is, that's a 20 percent local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| Thank you. Thanks, Don Michelle. Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Yeah, while you're there, Don Michelle, my concern from the outset on this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| I know we appropriated funds for the design work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| for some geotechnical work to decide whether that bank would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| that large bridge without special reinforcement due to the karst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| soils and whatnot, but when you come down to the bridge itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| it serves at least 50 percent, if not primarily UT. I mean, it goes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| the student housing on the south side over to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| basketball arena is and they were going to use, they were talking about using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| one of the ramp platforms for Thompson Bowling to do it, and it seems to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| the university has to be a big dollar player. Now, I heard the mayor say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| you got to get the grant before you can move forward, but this is something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| you know, I don't think the city taxpayers should be bearing the heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| load if, in fact, UT does not want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| money in this pot because they're the big winner on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| bridge. It isn't coming downtown. It isn't coming to a place that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| you know, residents can park. I mean, if you park improperly at UT, your car will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| be bye-bye. Yeah, and then again, this is only a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| process. We're going to understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| based on the funding amount that we'll receive. That helps us to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| talking to those private developers on the south side as well as talking to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Everybody has to bring something to the table. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| I appreciate the mayor's comments. I just want you to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| if UT is not going to be a player, I don't know if we're going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| with six million dollars. That's a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| and there are other priorities in this city, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Mayor Brown. Oh, yes, Donna Michelle. When you apply for a grant like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| roughly how long does it take to hear back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| from them? How long is that process? Well, right now, they don't have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| exact date, but we expect to hear something back in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Donna Michelle. So, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2740)|

| 0:45:55| I just want to adopt my comments and Dave Massey's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| to put it in the right place, and I apologize for miscueing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2759)|

| 0:46:14| talk again? Just one other point unrelated to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| calming, and that is, you know, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| important that the residents and taxpayers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| community members realize that this is a combination document. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2785)|

| 0:46:41| pretty much locks in the city in terms of the projects that it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| undertake on a capital level. Obviously there's a safety valve, and you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| always amend this document with the right type of super majorities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| whatnot, but it's both a sort of a, what, a funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| approval and a planning cycle thing looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2819)|

| 0:47:05| on the city's website. Thanks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150526?start=2825)|
