| 0:01:16| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I, over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| I never thought that we would see what's unfolding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| what seems, of course, a world away and in a faraway land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| but we have a lot of Ukrainian community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| of Ukrainian descent here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| and it amazes me on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| to watch history repeating itself in such a profound way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| So I wanted to take an opportunity tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| to invite Pastor Peter Fesuk to join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| from the Grace Christian Church and the Slavic community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| to give tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you so much for this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| to be with you guys today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| My name is Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| and I want to thank every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| for praying for Ukraine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| and helping with the situation in Ukraine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| My relatives, my ancestors, they're all Ukrainians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| My wife, Lena, her parents are currently in Ukraine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| and they're helping with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| It's horrible. It's scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| It's something that I could never dream of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| So I really want to thank everyone for your prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| and your support for the Ukrainian people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| I would like to read a small passage from the Holy Bible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| before we say a quick prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Jesus said this in Matthew chapter 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| Blessed are the poor in spirit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Years ago, Time magazine did a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| asking how many people are truly happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| and one-third of Americans said that they are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| I think in 2022, that percentage is definitely lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| But the question still stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| where can I find true happiness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| I mean, it's part of my DNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| part of everyone's DNA to find happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| And Jesus tells us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| blessed or joyful or happy are the poor in spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=208)|
| 0:03:37| Blessed, happy are those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| that recognize their need for God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| It's the opposite of being arrogant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| the opposite of being the person who doesn't need God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| a person who is self-reliant or self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| And even if we're in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| we still are looking for happiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| and that happiness can be found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| whenever we, as human beings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| find, recognize our need for God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| That brings us to humility, and we discover happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| May God help all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| to find that true happiness as human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| And in this prayer, let's pray for Ukraine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| and pray for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Lord Jesus, we thank you for this wonderful opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| to be in this building, to have this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| God bless Ukraine, bless the Ukrainian people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| bless them in this situation they found themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| It's a horrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Let them find happiness and peace in you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| only you can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| And also, God bless America, bless Tennessee, bless Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| and help us as human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| find happiness, find purpose of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| and that can be only in you, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you very much, sir, for those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=309)|

| 0:05:34| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=337)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=348)|

| 0:28:56| do not want to go against a rule that's been adopted by this body. However, since it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| been a fairly recent change and I don't think there was any intent to subvert the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| by these two folks, I will entertain a motion to suspend the rules and allow these two additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1747)|

| 0:30:48| the reason you're having, we're doing this for 2026 is because the Comptroller of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Treasury mandates that it be put in place in advance and all that. Kind of just give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1853)|

| 0:31:12| is this memorandum of understanding. Also, it's a county commission resolution signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| off on it to make sure that they lock us in doing it the right way. In other words, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| make rules and regulations we have to go by. No matter who the assessor is, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| do it by their rules and they let you know what those are. So they change from time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| time, but basically it's just the same, mostly just everything about market value. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| have statistics that we have to meet in every reappraisal and that'll be true in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=1903)|

| 0:34:31| The North Battalion continues every month to be the busiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| with 517 emergencies, and just to give you an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| that is 200 emergencies more than any other part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| Don't know why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| And the busiest times were between 6 and 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Last month we did experience a fire fatality in East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| in a trailer fire off Jones Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| We never like to report that kind of news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| but there were circumstances that led to the fatality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| that were beyond the fire department's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Through our partnership with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| we added three new educational videos to the YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| We had 58,000 views for the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| representing 4,000 hours of program time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| and logging 700 and right at 50,000 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| In addition, we also had some in-person events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| totaling 510 contacts, so total contacts via all the conduits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| was right at 59,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| The recruit class is almost complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| with the EMT portion of their academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| and the fire portion begins May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| We anticipate that becoming complete by the end of summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| and we are planning a fall Citizen's Fire Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| so you'll have the opportunity to attend that if you are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| On Wednesday, April 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| our fire department suffered a very heartbreaking loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| One of our own lost his battle with cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| and passed away early that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Richard Hormes was a 30-plus-year veteran of our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| most of those years spent in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| He loved South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Richard was also a 39-year veteran of the United States Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and the Army Reserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and they actually told me at his funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| that he begged them to let him re-up for two more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and they said, we're sorry, but we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Richard was a gentle giant that never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| never had a crossword to say to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| and his only family, aside from his sister,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| was his fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| He was one of the kindest, hardest-working individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| that ever walked the planet, we're sure of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| When he was diagnosed with cancer, he asked the training chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| sat in the room with all the chief officers, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| look, I'm going to go fall behind in my training hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| but you've got to tell me if there's a way I can keep him up from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| He was that good of a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| He never missed work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| In fact, every shift he was early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| He loved his job, he loved serving the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I could go on and on, but what I'm asking for you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| is to pray for your fire department, because we are struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and we are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Commissioner Daley made it to the funeral, and we appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| but it is a rough time getting over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| because he was that good, and we miss him already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| I don't see any questions, but very sorry for your loss, Captain Bagwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| and thank you, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| It's the presentation of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| by President Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Welcome, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Each of you has a copy of our latest edition of our Eco report that we do out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| so it's really great information in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| I also want to say that I have messed something up pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| For months now, I've been coming here and talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| how our labor force has been behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| and the fact that since the pandemic began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| one of the reasons we were struggling for our workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| because we just had people leave the labor force at a pretty substantial rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| Well, then we actually went back and looked at numbers, and that wasn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Between February 20, when we started really seeing the effects of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| through March of 22, our labor force is actually up over 8,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| So that's 8,000 people that are employed or unemployed within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| Let me make sure I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Our unemployment rate in that February 20 timeframe was 3.1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| in March, 2.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Which means now we have 1,500 people less unemployed in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| than we did before the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| even though we have 8,000 people more in the labor force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| This isn't a people leaving the labor force problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| it's that we have more jobs available than we have people to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| We have more people, we keep hearing from our employers, people don't want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| We had people not want to work before the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| people do not want to work now or can't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| The issue is we have more open positions than we have people to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| And so that's why a big part of our work now is going to be, we've got to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| We've got to grow the labor force here to be able to match all the jobs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| So, I'm happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Any questions for Mr. Odom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| With the number of businesses that are expanding, coming online, moving here, etc., etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2400)|
| 0:40:10| do you have any forecasting of what that gap is going to look like over the next 6 months or 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| I know we don't look too far out these days because it changes so often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| It's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| We're hearing businesses are doing a number of things to try to meet the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| whether it be raising compensation, looking in areas they haven't looked before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| like, for instance, previously incarcerated citizens, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Automation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| We had a conversation recently with a manufacturer out at Forks the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| He said he spent, let's see, $1.5 million to automate two processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| that eliminated the need for 13 jobs that he couldn't fill anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| He made back his money in 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| We're going to see more and more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Those kind of things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| So the need's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Are you and your team aligned with the trades academies we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| Pellissippi, UT, our educational centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| I know about a year ago we were talking about trying to align what they were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| the graduates that they were pulling out versus what our needs were in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| and trying to get those on more parallel tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| How is that effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| It's going great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| The issue's not so much the alignment anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| it's the pipeline of people going into them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| to be able to get the certifications and the training that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Any other questions from the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| As always, this brings us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Under our rules, we have two segments of public forum at our commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| The first segment comes after honorary resolutions and presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| and that's the segment we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| And that involves those speaking only on items specifically on our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| And then a general public forum takes place once we have worked through our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| So we do have one person who has signed up to speak on a particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| and that is Dylan Early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Mr. Early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Sir, if you will state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I'll have the clerks set the timer at five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and you may address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Dylan Early, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| And thank you, Mr. Chairman and the rest of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| for hearing me out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| I'm speaking on agenda item 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| which is the proposed lease agreement between Thunder Mountain Properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| and the county on Bowers Field in South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| And for those of you that are unaware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I am a candidate for Knox County Commission at Large C10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| but tonight I'm here not as a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| but as an outraged citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| I'm here before you today because it's finally happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| The children of South Knox and their opportunities to play recreational sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| have become a political bargaining chip for a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| that intends to try and run the county's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Now to the untrained eye, this proposed lease agreement appears harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| A lease agreement between the county and a landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| who says their only goal is to see kids play ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| In reality, however, a developer is holding these ball fields hostage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| for the purpose of exerting political pressure on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| and to avoid paying taxes on the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| It's a disgrace to me that this commission has favored developers so heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| that we've come to a point where they feel justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| in holding our children's most sacred institutions hostage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| for the purpose of exerting their own will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| And my question to the commission tonight is, when does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| What do we give up next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Our libraries? Our playgrounds? Our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| What are we willing to sacrifice next in this development fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| And at what point does this commission decide to stop bending the knee to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| and put the needs of Knox County first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| You see, I live in South Knox. I'm here to speak on behalf of South Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| because no one is listening to South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Bowers Field is a precious place to people like me and other people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| You see, our cousins, our children, our nieces, our nephews play ball at Bowers Field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| and the parents are all giving me the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| When does Thunder Mountain Properties get to decide they don't want to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| with this lease anymore after the 10 years is up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| What ball field is next? What institution is next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| The fact that this has become just another piece of negotiations for this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| is just another symptom of this disease that the county commission has created for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| But today you have the chance to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| You have the chance to vote against this resolution and demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| that the county be able to continue using the ball fields without any further payment or penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| Otherwise, I have a grave fear that the remainder of our children's institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| will continue to be used as political bargaining chips for developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you, Mr. Early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2703)|

| 0:45:34| which was relocated as part of Watt Road Interchange with I-40 in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2734)|

| 0:47:53| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2873)|

| 0:47:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| At the work session, I was asked a question about whether or not a party with a sibling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2879)|
| 0:48:15| who worked for the Sheriff's Department could serve as a Merit Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| I did not have my rules in front of me at that meeting and I gave you an answer that was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Rule 3.2D of the Merit Council rule states that a member of the Merit Council cannot serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2904)|
| 0:48:32| if they have members of the immediate family who are an employee of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| and that rule goes on to state that the term members of the immediate family includes siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| So I apologize for that error and I wanted to set that record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you for that, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I just wanted to check on the proceedings, how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Are we going to take nominations for the seat and vote on it and then come back and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| nominations for the alternative and then vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=2942)|

| 1:03:09| I have a motion to approve on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Now open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Mr. Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Is the counsel for the Barrett Council here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Is there a lawyer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Mr. Busler, I spoke with her yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I swear, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| All this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| I spoke with her either Friday or today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| I can't recall which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| I don't think she was planning to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| While I was getting it over, we talked about the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| about what we needed to do to keep the Barrett Council almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| intact like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And the only one thing that was lacking on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| she agreed or that party agreed with going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| with the 1974 ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| But the thing it did, it did not protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| the members of the Barrett Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| The ordinance that's before you has a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| that keeps the current members of the Barrett Council in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| for the remainder of their terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| and also has a new provision from the one that was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| introduced by Law Director Book in December that also states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| that the passage of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| will not affect any of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| or staff of the Knox County Barrett System Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| And the reason why I brought this before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| was that was the thing that was kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| of a sticking point about the members of the Barrett Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| So we added that amendment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| so that it would protect the members of that council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| or Barrett Council as it is now, through their terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Durick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| I would like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| that we postpone this for 30 days or until our May meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| just due to the fact that, yes, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Davis for the Council for the Merit System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| did, in fact, get that comparison with the 1974| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| and the current set of rules and regulations for the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| However, we just received it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I have not had time to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Also, with this being an addition to our agenda that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| was not already on there from our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| I would like time to also go through it, compare it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| do our homework, which we are supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| to be doing sitting in these seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| for the best of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| So substitute motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I have a substitute motion by Commissioner Durick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| to postpone this item until, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| going to say, the May 23rd Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| Commissioner Daley, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner Bussler, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| You do want your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| OK, it's off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Is there any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| All in favor of the substitute motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| We will hear this item in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Mr. Chairman, I just wondered if it might be wise to do a work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| session on this, since this is a big, big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| If we could maybe schedule a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| This would have been first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| so we would have time to do a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| But since, I agree, we need to look at it closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| But if we could look at the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| and is Ms. Davis still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| I'm sure if we asked her to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| I'm sure she would be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| OK, that would be a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Yes, Commissioner Daley, I'll actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| have a couple of pretty important items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| to talk about at the end of our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| on scheduling some work sessions and public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4049)|
| 1:07:29| So if we can agree on a date, we'll certainly get one set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| Madam Clerk, are we to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| OK, we have now reached the second segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| We have several individuals who have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| to speak on various items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| And I'm going to call them in the order that they signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| And you'll each be given up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| First, we have Caitlin Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| Good evening, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| If you will state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| you have up to five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| My name is Caitlin Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| As you are all aware, I am a mother of a six-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Alec has Down syndrome and other disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| that qualifies him for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| On September 24, 2021, a federal judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| put a temporary injunction stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| students and staff of Knox County had to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| The problem with this order was it blatantly discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| against children with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| who were unable to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| This discrimination was not rectified by the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| until he released a new order on October 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| So for 19 days, the school did, as the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| in his office instructed them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| and actively denied students their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| to free appropriate public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| and openly discriminated against children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| I have always been vocal about this abhorrent behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| and spoke at many school board meetings, protests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| on news and podcast interviews, and TikTok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I, along with many of your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I, along with many of your constituents from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| advocated for Tennessee Bill HB 9077 during special session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| to address the egregious behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| that the government was taking in the name of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4147)|

| 1:11:47| and admit what you did was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| or we can continue the way we have for the last eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| The choice is yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4312)|

| 1:11:56| I would also like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| that it's kind of disappointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| that an elected official chose and continues to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| not to show up to meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| where his constituents have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| to speak to him directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| This is not the first meeting he's chosen not to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| and I'm sure this won't be his last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I don't know if you want me to bring this to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| so I can give this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| or I can stop by his office tomorrow and give it to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| but he is officially served as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4340)|

| 1:12:33| you wanted to speak in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Ms. Williams, if you'll state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4356)|

| 1:12:39| you have up to five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4359)|

| 1:12:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Katrin Williams in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| He's gonna hand out something that I made for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| so you can review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| It's a quick card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| There's a QR code on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| and I will show you just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| I'm gonna scan it my own phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| It pulls up a Dropbox link to a video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| that I would encourage you to watch in your own time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| when you have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4387)|
| 1:13:07| but in the interest of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I'm not gonna play it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| I am excited, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| to have the opportunity to speak to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| and have my voice be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I am here to ask the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| to establish a citizen board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| which would review, advise, and consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| to any and all claims by the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| and Knox County Law Director of Sovereign Immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| I'll admit, I didn't know what sovereign immunity was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| a little over a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| I was, frankly, shocked to learn that this is a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| that exists still in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I admittedly understand generally why it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| why it's still here, and why it's used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| but it has gone far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and there are enough cases where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| in my case at least, it seems ridiculous, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| So I'm gonna give you a quick rundown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| of why I'm asking you to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4444)|

| 1:14:31| saw the person had their flashers on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| got out of the car, realized the car had overheated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| and suggested that he push her car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| into a nearby parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| which happened to be our apartment community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| In doing that, he pushed the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| without anyone in the car to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| It went down a hill and into our office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| resulting in more than $26,000 of damage to our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and totaled the woman's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| I did obtain the body camera footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| from a public records request, reviewed the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| I've watched it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I could probably quote most of it to you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| That's what you have to view from this QR code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| I did take some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| There is a full video I'd be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| to provide at anyone's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| but this is about six minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| of some of the best parts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| In the video, you can see that the officer did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| he knew that there was no one in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| when he started pushing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| and pushed the car with no one to control it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| lost control, and we have a bus to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| I wanna make a point, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| that I'm not here to bash our sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| I'm not here to say anything bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| about our law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| I have a tremendous amount of respect for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| and the good work that they do, otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| But, in cases where there's a mistake made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| and someone is harmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| you should do the right thing and own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| In this case, I did go to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| They directed me to risk management with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| I presented everything I had to risk management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| including the body camera footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| including my own security footage from my building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| the professional restoration company's estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| of more than $26,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| and my only reply that I have had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| after our investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Knox County is denying the liability claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| Nobody has contacted me other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Nobody's reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Nobody's explained why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| So, I did what the rest of us would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| if it was a person that had ran a car through our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| and I took it to the small claims court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| where I was shocked that Knox County Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| filed a motion to dismiss because of sovereign immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| So, not only did they not take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| for the damage, but also said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| you also can't sue me for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| I didn't know that was a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| so that was very surprising to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| He then filed a brief in support of sovereign immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| with lots and lots and lots of lines that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| in a lot of different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| the king can't be held accountable in his own court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| and to his own subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| So, I would like for you to review the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| if you have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| In the video, I want you to understand, as I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| most people in that video, if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| every officer that responded to the scene understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| that Knox County, an officer, made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| It was an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| It was an accident, but it was a bad accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| and they were gonna be on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| They said things like, you destroyed a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| Gray Coup, I can't believe you did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| George Gray Coup has now pushed a car through a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| and someone else says, another officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| the thing is, we were helping when someone suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| that's a large enough claim that needs to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| on a state report, and they replied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| we helped, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| And two supervisors were called to the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| and an admin was notified, end quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| by a lieutenant, because you were pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| It seems clear to me they knew they were on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| I don't know why they're not owning up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| but in this case, I think it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| for a board of citizens to decide if the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| gets to hide behind a claim of sovereign immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| instead of just saying, I'm the king and you can't sue me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| So, it's basically all I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I just wanted to set up kind of the instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Please do watch the video if you have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| and I'm going to let him come in now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you, Ms. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4726)|
| 1:18:46| Mr. Williams, if you'll state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| and county of residence, you also have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Yes, my name is Steve Williams, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| and many of y'all have known me for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| I've been around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| We've raised our family here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| We have built a business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| We've been in business in East Tennessee for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| in Knoxville since, I think, 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| Catron's my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| I want to go ahead and put that out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| She and my son pretty much run the business now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| and I was quite shocked to find out that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| and the Sheriff's Department were claiming sovereign immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| This is a concept that comes from 1765| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| before this country was ever even created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| I'm passing out the motion and the brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| from the Deputy Law Director, Myers Morton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| and I read the brief, and it's an excellent brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| He did an excellent job in describing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| and quotes in there that I pointed out and highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| The king cannot be sued, next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| because no court can have jurisdiction over him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| The king could do no wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| and the most important one that shocked me the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| a subject who deems himself wronged by the king| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| could petition the king for redress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| but could not sue the king without the king's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| I say, this goes against everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| we believe in in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| People are moving from all over this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| to live in Knox County because our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| is responsive to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Our government listens to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and there's no question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| nothing in the brief even talks about liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Did we do it, did we not, did we mess up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| did we do anything wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| It just says, go away, you can't sue us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| because we're the king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| And I just don't think in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| we need to live that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| I would object to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| and I hope most people would object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| So, everybody says, come with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| Don't come and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| And we have a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| and the proposal would be for Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| to establish a citizen-led review and consent board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| that where citizens have a say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| before Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| declares themselves immune from any and all responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| to its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| This would level the playing field for citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| because sovereign immunity when claimed by the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| cuts off any redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| It just says, the government is the king,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| there is no redress because we say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| And honestly, I just don't think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| how we want to live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| I don't think that's American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Nevertheless, we ask that Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| create a citizen review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| made up of one citizen from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| to advise and consent to any proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Knox County law director's claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| of sovereign immunity from liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| before the Knox County law director uses sovereign immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| as a defense in any motion, negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| filing claim, or damages against Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| or Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| And that's our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| We're forced to file in circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Knox County is denying any liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| I feel like, and this is my subjection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| being a businessman in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I think the county's forcing this in the circuit court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| to try to paperwork us to death and to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| I mean, I'm not gonna say who said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| but a county official said, a county officer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| if you go to circuit court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| it's gonna cost you a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| And that's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Citizens shouldn't be treated this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| We took it to Sessions Court because we felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| we could walk into Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| we could show the video, we could speak our piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| the county could speak its piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| the Sheriff's Department could speak its piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| we could sell it that day and y'all go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| still be friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Because we gotta learn to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| And no one from the Sheriff's Department, not one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| no one from Knox County government, not one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| has spoken to her, who's been in charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| and no one has come to our office and no one's spoken to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| And I just submit that that's not the way to behave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| and I'm asking the commission to try to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| You heard this lady before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| There's a problem going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I think it's time to step in and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| And I humbly submit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Commissioner Jay, your light's been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Did you have a question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| With your permission, I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| I know it's not traditional during a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| I'm reluctant to turn it into a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| but if you have clarifying questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I just, two clarifying questions, not a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Could you, sir, could you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| what are the total damages to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| for repair, the car, which you may or may not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| and any other filings or fees that you paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I have a pretty good estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| We have an estimate from a testament restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| about 26,200, 300 bucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| and the lady that owned the car was worth about $5,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| And any other fees or things that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| court filings, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Well, we haven't added any fees for herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| No, no, but have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Oh, yeah, we have court filings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Circuit court was, wow, almost 500 bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| And then we have Sessions Court filings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| and then, of course, that got dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| So we're probably 1,000 bucks into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| filing fees and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| We had to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Catron did a public records filing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| We had to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| To get the body cam and all the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| that the sheriff wouldn't release, we had to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| And have you repaired the building at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| We're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:46| We've ordered the parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| We have a subcontractor now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| and we did the temporary repair to emergency repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| to make sure everything was safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Mr. Moyers, could you help just explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| what sovereign immunity is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:06| Help us better understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Sovereign immunity is a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| It is something that is incorporated in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| I think there's been a real misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| about what it is and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Sovereign immunity is not something the county claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| It's not something the county invokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| It's not a defense that the county raises as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| What it is, is the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| has basically incorporated into a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| called the Governmental Tort Liability Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| how and for what local governments can be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| This is completely the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And the state legislature has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| that local governments, counties, and cities as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| can only be sued in the circuit court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| for the district where the county lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| That's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| And it creates subject matter jurisdiction for the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| So even if the county said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| okay, we'll agree to be sued in Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| the Sessions judge would not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| subject matter jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| because the Tennessee legislature has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| that the county can only be sued in circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| That's not our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| That's the legislature's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| The Governmental Tort Liability Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| talks about defenses the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| It talks about limits of liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| that the county is subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| That's all controlled in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| It's not controlled here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| And so initially what happened in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| was this case was filed in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Mr. Morton filed a motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| because the Sessions Court simply does not have jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| to hear these matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| where they involve liability of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Now, I can't comment on the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| of this particular lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| because the case is in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| It wouldn't be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| And frankly, I don't know all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| But we are not immune from liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| for acts of negligence by our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| if that's what happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| We get sued every day by people who claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| that employees of Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| have damaged them in some way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Those cases are uniformly brought in circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| No jury is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| It's bench trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| That, again, these are decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| that are made by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| As recently as the 1960s or 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| it actually was impossible to sue local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| But the state Supreme Court said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| that's not gonna apply anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| And that's when the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| created the Governmental Liability Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Even today, the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| cannot be sued in our local courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| If you have a claim against the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| say these are state troopers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| instead of Knox County Sheriff's Department officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| If you filed an action in Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| they'd file a motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| If you filed an action in circuit court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| they'd file a motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| Because if you're going to take an action against the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| you have to go to the Tennessee State Claims Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Again, the theory that underlies that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| the reason that the county is not like your company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| if one of your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| is the concept of sovereign immunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| which yes, goes back hundreds of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| But it's not something that we sit around and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| oh, let's invoke sovereign immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| How you can sue the county is governed by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| And that's really what this was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And I'm sorry, we've had to have this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| and I would love to be perfectly happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| to have this discussion with you any time you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| But I just don't want you to have the wrong idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| that we're invoking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| This is just straight up statutory law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Well, I guess I got it from the brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| the motion, the footnote at the very bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| It says those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| And that's the underlying theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| that goes way, way back as to why you can't sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| But it's not, we're not invoking the theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| This is not a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| I guess, something that is created by judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| This is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| And I could show you the statute, be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| It says that jurisdiction for actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| under the Governmental Tort Liability Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| which is the only way you get negligence liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| against a county, have to be brought in the circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| And there's liability limits that are, fortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| in your case, way above the damages that you suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| But there are rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| And those rules are set in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| They're not set by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| They're not discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| We can't waive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| They're the law, and everybody has to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| But what could have been waived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| and this is what's so disappointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| there's no reason to force a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| small business person, to file a circuit court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| when no one will even sit and talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and have a conversation about what happened and who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| I mean, I can spend 10, 20, $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| going through circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| And it makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| I understand your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| But we, like you, have to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| the Tennessee state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| And so do the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| And if a judge does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| subject matter jurisdiction over a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| any judgment they render is invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| No, I'm not, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| I get that 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| I guess what I'm saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| why do we have to go to circuit court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| when we have convincing video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| I think, Mr. Williams, I think your point is well taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| and I actually just received a text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| from a friend of this effect, and I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| You should not have to sue the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Correct, that's my point, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| In this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5462)|
| 1:31:02| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| I know Mr. Moyers would be glad to meet with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| as well as any of us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Mr. Moyers has always been a straight up guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| all those years I've known him, I'd love to meet with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Okay, can I ask a quick follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:15| Because some of the language in the motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| filed by the Deputy Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| and the brief in support of sovereign immunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| which, this is not my training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| so I've been learning all of this as I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| It did specifically say that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| the king cannot be sued without his consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Is there a case in which the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| can consent to a session suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| I really can't put it any plainer than that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| The state legislature has told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| this is how you go about suing the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| That is a question of subject matter jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| As I said before, this gets very lawyerly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| You cannot consent to subject matter jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| And so, if a judge does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| subject matter jurisdiction over a matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| he has no authority to rule on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| So, that's why we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| It's not in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| The legislature has decreed this and we have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| But we could have a discussion about settling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Thank you, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| David Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Is David Garrett here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Mr. Garrett, if you will state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| David Garrett, Jr., Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| I've lived in Knox County about 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| The past four years I've lived in the NSKIPP community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| One bedroom, 500 square foot apartment, $435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| This year it's become $1,007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| because a company called PW Investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| bought our building from private owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| One in five houses or apartment communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| are owned by corporations now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| kind of unlike the one before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And it's just gotten sick to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| it's getting hard to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| I can't meet the move out date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| so a friend's taking me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| All my neighbor's rents have increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| anywhere from $840 to over $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| And contact the state, Briggs has not said anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| Gloria Johnson has not said anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Like to see if the county can try to get the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| to do something about rent control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| because it's getting out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Like the guy from the Chamber of Commerce said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| there's too many jobs, not enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| But there's nowhere for the people to move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| And basically we do have a bunch of out-of-towners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| moving in, that's making it difficult too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| But there's not enough houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| or not enough apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| And I'd like to see the county try to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| with the state about rent control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| if the county can't do anything itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Jason Bailey is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| Jason had to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Ernie, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| He went to the wrestling match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| And no one knows where Jonathan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5670)|
| 1:34:30| Okay, all right, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I guess that brings us then to Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| Hello, Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| Hi, Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| I'm gonna read you an excerpt from an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| I sent to the Secretary of State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| and the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| I would like to inform you that I have violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| TCA code 27115B when I voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| in the Knox County Republican primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| on April 13th, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I invite you to charge me with this crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| So that was not something I was aware was a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| before I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| As soon as I found out about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| I notified the proper authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I was a little nervous to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| because clearly I violated the Tennessee code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| And I emailed the people that could enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| I haven't received a reply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| haven't received a phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| a knock on the door, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| And so it started to get me to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| where else am I seeing in our society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| where people just openly commit crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| and it just goes under the radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| Maybe not the radar, but certainly goes unpunished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| And I think to board of education meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| where they're dismissing what seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| legitimate complaints against them themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| I see the Sheriff's office openly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| just simply saying they're not going to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| a lawfully implemented mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| at the beginning of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I'm seeing developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| and Lord knows we need some affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| based on everything we just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I'm seeing developers doing blatant acts of vandalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| not for the sake of defacing the communities they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| just being inconsiderate of the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| that they're moving into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And all of that is going simply with no enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| to the laws that they're breaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| So I started looking at the Knox County Sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| inmate population to see what laws are we enforcing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| And there are some people that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| in the Knox County Detention Facility, don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| But I see a ton of people in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| that are charged with nothing more than trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| And I can only guess that they need some very intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| very immediate mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| I read stories in the news about women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| calling the Knox County Sheriff's Department for assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| because their domestic partner is physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| and emotionally abusing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| And when the cops get there, they arrest these women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| because they are not citizens because of their nationality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| And the pastor's prayer really, really struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| that we need to start refocusing on the least among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5853)|
| 1:37:43| We need to start saying to the wealthy and the powerful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| hey, you have to play the roles too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| And we have to start looking at the poor and the voiceless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| and saying, okay, they've committed a nominal crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| but that's probably systematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| of the society in which they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| And what I'm seeing at the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| what I'm seeing on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| what I'm seeing in the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| is that we are creating a caste system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| where if you have money and you have power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| you can get away with stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| I am objectively rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| I'm not a multimillionaire, but I live in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| I have a very nice house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| My kids go to a great school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| and I just got away with a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| pending somebody from here doing something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| But there's homeless people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| that are getting arrested and being charged with felonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| for sleeping outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| And the political divisiveness that we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| in these legislative bodies is perpetuating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| And I don't think that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| I know that doesn't accord with my faith system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| I assume it doesn't accord with your faith system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| Most of us consider Jesus Christ as the model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| in which we should live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| And we all would readily accept that Jesus Christ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| would be in that lower caste system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| So what I, as a military veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| I've seen a lot of different leadership styles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| and the only one that's absolutely proven to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| is to lead by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| And that's what I'm asking you as a body to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| is to step up and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| I am not going to give in to the wealthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| and powerful request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| I'm going to consider the people that they are affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| I'm going to give voice to the voiceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| I am going to give grace to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I appreciate your time and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Thank you, Mr. Brea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| This concludes our second segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| I believe that brings us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| Does it not, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I just want to follow up with Mr. Brett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| is that your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Because as I hear you speak, my spirit is riled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| because a year ago at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| that's when all the sheriff officers lined up the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| for protesters that were majority black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| And it still brings me a lot of emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| of how humanity is selfish as hell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6023)|
| 1:40:33| When I sat and watched all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| who were against the mass yelling at us who were white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| I will always bring this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| because I feel like it's my spiritual conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| to always bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| I have a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| And it seems like it's a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| around merit council, insurer's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| I pray for the complete disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| And for the simple fact, we voted for two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| in the merit council, and one of them is really close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| to our law director too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| when we had a qualified person of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| And I need to say that because we need something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| to change ASAP or we ain't gonna make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Two things, we've got some scouts down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| I guess they didn't have anything to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Must be citizenship in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Well, you get done, come on up if you got any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Mark your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6105)|
| 1:41:45| May 10th is Farm Day, and it's at Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| All commissioners are invited to stop by between nine and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| just to see what's going on at Farm Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Number one, number one in the state is agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| followed by tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| The agricultural is still keen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| So May 10th at Chihuahua Park, nine to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| It was talked about having a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| about the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| We can actually discuss a date for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| after I get with Drew to see when this room is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| or the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| But I did want to talk briefly about the budget season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| and the process for approving the budget for FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| We do, of course, have a regular work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| scheduled on May 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| It was my intent to hold the first public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| on the budget on that night, on May 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| But of course, I think we would want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| at least a second public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| One or both of those to hear from department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| also give the public an opportunity to have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| And I want to look at the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| of a special called meeting sometime in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| week to 10 days of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| I'll send out some dates in the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| and you guys can let me know which ones work best for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-business?start=6197)|
