| 2:37:22| was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| last year, very due diligent in terms of our if approved, our website, where we've gained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| public information. We've also received letters of intent from over 75 families who have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| filled out letters of intent for Knoxville Prep. And I can tell you, looking at the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| of those families, they're coming from all over Knoxville, everyone in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| Each district represented here has at least one student who has filled out a letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| interest. So they're coming from all over and we really can't control who applies. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| control our marketing, where we really tailor and market to the underrepresented students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9472)|
| 2:38:00| and families. For example, at Chattanooga Prep, and we'll do this for Knoxville Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| too, we have translators that go to our community meetings in the event that Spanish speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| families need help filling out the application. So in terms of a target of leaving in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| attendance zone, it's not really feasible for us to have, filter those students when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| we have to be open for all Knox County kids. Okay. Then based on that, how can you, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9499)|
| 2:38:31| can you achieve your goal of reaching those students who are potentially in a poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| situation or underachieving? How do you ensure that if it's just wide open? Sure. And a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9518)|
| 2:38:46| example is Chattanooga Prep. I don't know if you're familiar with the Chattanooga region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| but we're in Highland Park. We have students that come from all over Hamilton County. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| same will be in Knox County, but the only thing we can control in that is, is how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| market and who we're marketing to. So we will be very strategic in our marketing community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| events that we have, application events that we have to ensure that our applications and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9546)|
| 2:39:11| our marketing is geared towards those that are underrepresented, under economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9551)|
| 2:39:18| performing, that look for choice in their education. Okay. So along that same line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9558)|
| 2:39:26| when we're looking at the area where you're beginning, we're looking between two fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9566)|
| 2:39:34| high income neighborhoods, high housing values. If we're looking at Old North Knox, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9574)|
| 2:39:43| a neighborhood that has had quite a lot of improvement over years, as has Fourth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| Gill. So it concerns me that right in the center there is, doesn't seem to be the target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9588)|
| 2:39:56| demographic. But also, if we are going to add a choice, I'm concerned about why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9596)|
| 2:40:04| adding it within 1.6 miles of Emerald, within a short distance of Beaumont Magnet, within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9604)|
| 2:40:13| a short distance of Illinan STEM Academy. Why there, where we already have similar choices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| Sure. Great question, and I'm happy to answer. So very similar in Chattanooga, Highland Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| very few of our students live within the neighborhood of our school. Again, they come from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| If you look at the houses around Chattanooga Prep, they're $400,000, $500,000. The area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| is really developed. The same will be true here in Knoxville, to where we use buses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9636)|
| 2:40:43| bus stops. Any of our students that need transportation throughout Knox County, we're going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| that. For example, at Chattanooga Prep, we go all the way up to Hickson, Ottawa, to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| students in. And also, in terms of other charters being nearby, in Chattanooga, all the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9653)|
| 2:41:00| schools are within four blocks of each other, so we really don't overlap with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9660)|
| 2:41:05| We actually help each other. Just the other day, I received a call from a charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9665)|

| 2:41:15| teachers that applied for our positions that we might share with them, and we did. So charters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| being together can actually work together for the betterment of the community. And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| enough students that are looking for choice, enough families to serve, that all schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9684)|
| 2:41:31| will benefit from. I will also add, we have high school. Emeril goes to 8th grade currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| at the moment, so that's something we've talked to them about, about potentially supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| their 8th grade students having a choice going on into high school. So we would collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| with all schools, not just charter schools, but all schools, and how we can best support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| families and ensure that we're not overstepping. We're not here to cause harm. We're here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9707)|
| 2:41:54| parents have called us, community members have called us, to rise to the occasion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9714)|

| 2:42:05| I just have a couple more questions, and they're pretty quick. Someone, I don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9725)|

| 2:42:20| the 20s. Have there been any ACTs taken to date, or is that a future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| We have. How many of you all have taken your ACT? I know Tao had to have his ACT to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| accepted into Brown. Our school goal is a 21. Right now with sophomores, our average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9751)|

| 2:42:53| are exposed. ACT is about exposure, just like anything else. The younger you learn to swim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| the better swimmer you're going to be. The earlier you get to know the ACT, the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9780)|
| 2:43:04| you're going to do on the ACT. Our 6th graders, 7th graders, 8th graders especially, are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9784)|
| 2:43:10| excited to take the ACT every year. They take selfies with the ACT test. They're a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9790)|

| 2:43:41| I'll come back to it. Did you say that in Hamilton County there was already an all-girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9821)|
| 2:43:47| school before this one, and was it a Hamilton County school? There is an all-girls public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9827)|

| 2:44:33| an offering that was only for boys and not having something else. So in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| we don't have an all-girls school of any kind right now. So beginning an all-boys school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9878)|
| 2:44:45| on day one, we will have something for boys that we do not have for girls. So when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| Title IX challenge happens, and I think we all know that it will, when that Title IX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9891)|

| 2:45:29| single-gender models, offer single-gender models for kids. So at this time, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| not be in a Title IX violation according to our legal counsel. And we're going to abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| by what the law says and resort to Mr. McCarty on our legal representation. I would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9940)|
| 2:45:48| with Tennessee law. Absolutely, Tennessee law says that we can have single-sex schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| That's not really the issue. My question is really the disparity when we create a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9953)|
| 2:46:01| that is only boys, because there are federal guidelines that we have to offer the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9961)|
| 2:46:09| for girls, just like if we have a baseball facility and a softball facility, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| to be comparable. So if we have a boys' school and nothing, then that seems to me like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| would be an issue beyond Tennessee law saying, hey, it's okay. Because yeah, it's okay to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| have single-sex schools, but federal law tells us that it's not okay to have something for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9987)|
| 2:46:36| boys and not for girls. We've been advised by our legal counsel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=9996)|

| 2:47:08| exceptional results. And if the community demands an all-girls school, we would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| to present that to you all after the boys' school is established, if that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10032)|
| 2:47:19| the community desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| Thank you. And I think what you said just now is actually what I'm getting at. You would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| be in line with the law, but as the authorizer, we may not be in line with the federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| So I think that is something we need to explore at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| Thank you. Just to tap in on the marketing, just a statement. I understand that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10066)|
| 2:47:53| have engaged Akerman PR. And I really, again, appreciate all of your answers today via email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| that were very last minute and very prompt. But certainly when they reached out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| and I asked only a few of the questions that I asked you today, I was called combative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| So that was not exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| But to go on to my question, how would you all handle it if a student applies to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10093)|
| 2:48:20| school, is a boy, but was assigned a female at birth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| We would follow the current law. As I said, we've consulted with our attorney on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10104)|
| 2:48:30| question. We would follow the current law and consider every case-by-case as it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| So would you admit that student or would that be something that would disqualify them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| We would take it case-by-case for our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| And even the opposite way? Let's say you have a boy who's assigned male at birth, decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10127)|
| 2:48:54| to transition or identify as a female. That's just a case-by-case situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| We would take it case-by-case as it comes to us, in accordance with our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| Has your legal counsel made any statements on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| He has, and I will be glad to forward you the exact stance he has on that in recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10147)|
| 2:49:15| to us. I know he sent it to Mr. Blair, but I will be more than happy to send it and provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10155)|
| 2:49:20| it to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| Yeah, that would be great, because I think that that could ping off of some of the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| of us as an authorizer, what goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| You'll have it in your inbox by 12 o'clock tonight, if not sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| Again, I appreciate your promptness. And I have two more short questions. So I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| that your principal or proposed principal is not from Knoxville, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| That's correct, he's not from Knoxville, but our proposed assistant principal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| Okay, who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10188)|
| 2:49:49| Brian Mann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| And how did you choose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| He is an exceptional teacher and leader at Chattanooga Pro. He was actually a Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| teacher of the year two years ago. I would invite you to our school to see his classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| He's one of our founding teachers. You'll see a lot of excitement and joy in his class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| and he's going through a leadership program and has signed up to do our residency leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| program a full year before the school launches. So we did interviews, we looked at qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10211)|
| 2:50:18| for both the proposed principal and assistant principal, and out of the ten candidates we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| interviewed, both Chattanooga Prep leadership, but also our local advisory board met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10223)|
| 2:50:28| them, parents met with them, they had metrics, they had role plays, they had to do a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| extensive process and commit to a year of development through Relay Graduate School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| of Education and commit to move here to Knoxville. That's how the two proposed leaders were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| But the main thing was based on their academic results, because we know that the academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10246)|
| 2:50:50| outcomes of our students are our number one priority, and both our proposed leaders have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| a tremendous track history of providing excellent academic results for students. If you asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10254)|
| 2:51:01| any of our students here who their favorite teachers are and leaders are at Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| Prep, probably above me, it will be Mr. Mann and Mr. Howard. And we're putting our finest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10265)|
| 2:51:11| in Knoxville because we want to meet those expectations, we want to ensure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| held accountable, and we're going to put our best feet forward here for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| and families here in Knoxville. And we believe our success at Chattanooga Prep can only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| replicated through taking folks within that know our model, know our vision, know our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| mission, have those results to be able to go out and expand, just like a business would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10291)|
| 2:51:37| Like Starbucks, when they expand, they take their best talent and put them in the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10297)|
| 2:51:41| city, and that's what we're doing, because we want our Starbucks coffee in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| to taste the exact same way as in Chattanooga. And for that, it's our academic outcomes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10305)|
| 2:51:51| results we get for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| Last question, I promise. So Representative Sam McKenzie, who's come and spoke to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| he made a statement that I think we've all read, and I'm curious if you have reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| out to him, or if you've had any meetings with him, or if you plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| We have reached out to Representative McKenzie and would invite him and anyone else in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| community, on the board, leadership positions of any area of Knoxville to Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10333)|
| 2:52:20| to see. I know members of our board and leadership has reached out to Representative McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| to meet as well. I'm willing to meet with Representative McKenzie. We have the utmost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| respect for him and his leadership and the things he's done in Nashville to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| his constituents. So we'd love the opportunity to meet with he or any members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10351)|
| 2:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| All right. Mr. DuPort, did you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to echo what Mr. Scott's saying in that I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| correspondence with their counsel, Chris McCarty, and I know Chris pretty well, like Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10371)|
| 2:52:58| and he did send me some language, you know, around Title IX. There is an exception under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10378)|
| 2:53:05| Title IX. It's under 34 CFR 106, if anybody wants to look at that. And, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10385)|
| 2:53:13| language is in the report from the charter school application team. So you can email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10393)|
| 2:53:21| if you want to, but it's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| I'll have it in your inbox by noon tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| Thank you. These guys are looking really hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| I owe them dinner. Any suggestions, we can go on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| Ms. Owen, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll be very short. Since Ms. Byke mentioned being combative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| I just wanted to let you know that this is our normal questioning. This is more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10418)|
| 2:53:43| usual. It's actually probably a little light. So just for you to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| And I will say, please continue the questions. If you have questions past this meeting, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| email me, call me. I'll send out my phone number, my cell number. Please, please reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10433)|
| 2:53:59| out with any additional questions. I'm more than happy to answer them and appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| this opportunity. It's been an honor to meet everyone, be here in Knoxville, and hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| community members and have the potential opportunity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| All right. So any more questions, discussion, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10456)|
| 2:54:23| Okay. So moving on to public forum. But before I do, like I said, we have several of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10463)|
| 2:54:33| young men from Knox Prep here to speak. And of course, I am assuming they are not Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10473)|
| 2:54:38| County residents. So without strong objection, my recommendation would be to let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10478)|
| 2:54:47| They have sat here patiently through this whole meeting, unless someone is strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| We'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10500)|
| 2:55:01| Can we also let them go? Yeah. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10505)|
| 2:55:06| You're done with that second? Okay. So we will make a motion to let our students from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10506)|
| 2:55:14| Knox Prep speak at the beginning of public forum. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10514)|
| 2:55:21| Chattanooga Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| Chattanooga Prep. I'm sorry. It's been a long night. A motion and a second. So all in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10522)|
| 2:55:29| say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| Any opposed? Okay. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| First, we have Aaron Webb. Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| Hello. Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| Obviously, I'm not a student from Chattanooga Prep. However, if I could just take just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| couple of minutes to address this group, I would appreciate it. I am a board member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| Chattanooga Prep today, and I will be part of the leadership team of the Prep public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| school system, should you vote to allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| Mr. Watson asked me a question earlier about my why. Why am I a part of Chattanooga Prep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10559)|

| 2:57:43| is because I see myself in these young men. I see what potential they have. And you asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10663)|
| 2:57:48| a question about the white saviorism. Here's what I would say to that. Color should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10668)|

| 2:58:26| the decision down the road. So that's all I have to say. And thank you for allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10706)|

| 2:59:09| all that. This school offers me an opportunity. Like Mrs. Scott bragged about me, I got accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10749)|

| 3:00:14| the opportunity by opening KnoxPrep, that would be the same feeling as I did when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10814)|

| 3:00:58| to score a three. But because of the school giving me confidence to push a little harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| I scored a five on it. And I hope to score a four or a five on AP U.S., since that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10863)|
| 3:01:10| not my best subject ever. But I hope we can continue that over to Knox and give kids here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10870)|
| 3:01:20| an opportunity like they gave us at Chattanooga. And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=10880)|

| 3:07:58| So me being at Chatt Prep, it helped me a lot, because at my other school, my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11278)|
| 3:08:04| really didn't care about me or helped me a lot on my rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11284)|
| 3:08:08| And when I came to Chatt Prep, it helped me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| And I started doing better in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| And I went to tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| I had a mentor who actually cared about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| And I started getting all my work done and improving in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11299)|
| 3:08:23| And I even had some administrators to help me while I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| And they keep pushing me to be the best that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| So now I work for the school, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11311)|
| 3:08:35| I be there at all the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| I help set up for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| And I absolutely love the teachers, love the employees, love my classmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11319)|
| 3:08:45| And they help me be the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| And every time when I'm done, I always have people to come and talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| And they help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| And they help me in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| Because not like every school in Chattanooga, they don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| They don't show as much love that Chatt Prep do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| So I think if we created a school in Knoxville, it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11346)|
| 3:09:12| And they would actually show love to people in Chattanooga, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11352)|
| 3:09:16| and throughout the whole country of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11356)|
| 3:09:20| And that's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11363)|
| 3:09:24| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| I think, did I get to all of y'all who wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| I think that covered everybody on the list, but I just wanted to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| Well, thank you, boys, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| I know this is your spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| and this is how you chose to spend your spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| So thank you so much for being here and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| And hopefully you enjoy the rest of your night and get some dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| So we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| I'll start back up to the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| David Krebs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| Just say your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| David Krebs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| I live at 2661 Sherrod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| I'm a KCS science teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| I'm up here to share my experience as a charter school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| I've taught in New York and Georgia and Atlanta as a charter school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11414)|
| 3:10:20| Prior to stepping up here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| I also called two friends that still work at charter schools to see how it was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11422)|
| 3:10:28| In my experience as a teacher, what stands out in terms of a good school are three pillars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11428)|
| 3:10:35| culture, community involvement, and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| Something that has been lacking at all of the four schools that I have a connection to is consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11438)|
| 3:10:47| And I guess in addition to those three pillars, there's a fourth, and that's experienced teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11447)|
| 3:10:52| And those two things, consistency and experienced teachers, are not very prevalent at the schools I have experience in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11452)|
| 3:11:00| That's my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11460)|
| 3:11:05| In addition to this, some of the things that I found challenging in my experience was the lack of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11465)|
| 3:11:14| It seems like this culture or this charter school rollout seems like an experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11474)|
| 3:11:23| And so the facilities that I have worked at at a charter school, one was an old Atlanta public school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11483)|
| 3:11:30| The other one was a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| And so this facility lacked a science classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| It was carpeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11496)|
| 3:11:37| The students had physical education in the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| Among other things I've experienced is a level of disorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11504)|
| 3:11:50| I like to take my students out of the classroom, and I found that in Atlanta specifically, the administration was new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11510)|
| 3:11:57| and they didn't know the protocols for what I needed paperwork-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11517)|
| 3:12:01| And so a lot of that fell onto myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| And I'm all for teacher autonomy, but I find at KCS I'm provided that teacher autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11524)|
| 3:12:10| And I don't think I'm alone when I say that I value procedure and some bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11530)|
| 3:12:18| There needs to be some organized steps to take these journeys and adventures that pertain to education pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11538)|
| 3:12:34| Charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| I would also like to note that some things in my experience and my friends' experiences are charter schools provide really great stellar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11557)|
| 3:12:46| wraparound services that lack in traditional public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11566)|
| 3:12:51| And a lot of this has to do with finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| And I'd like to note that Tennessee ranks as a 45th in the nation per student in funding, which is extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11574)|
| 3:13:03| And I wonder if we didn't rank so low, if we'd have more money for some of these wraparound services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11583)|
| 3:13:10| And to name a few, some of the wraparound services that I'm familiar with that schools serve involve weekly therapy and tutoring after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11590)|
| 3:13:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11599)|
| 3:13:20| That's the end of the three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11601)|

| 3:13:26| Angela?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| Just state your name, county of residence in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| I'm Angela Patrick, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| I'm reading a statement on behalf of Paula Hancock, president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11615)|
| 3:13:41| Only our local school board is in the position to determine what kind of school is needed and where it is needed to enhance student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11621)|
| 3:13:48| and performance in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11628)|
| 3:13:50| As you look for alternatives to neighborhood and community schools that already suffer from a lack of resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| the interest of the Knox County Education Association is for all of our students to succeed, regardless of where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11636)|
| 3:14:03| Many of our students are being denied opportunities because their school and communities are underfunded and under-resourced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11643)|
| 3:14:10| We believe that our traditional public schools should be fully funded to give all students the opportunity they need to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11650)|
| 3:14:17| Chronic underfunding has been plagued Tennessee's traditional public schools for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11657)|
| 3:14:22| Traditional public schools have proven themselves to outperform other education alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11662)|
| 3:14:28| We must fully fund our traditional public schools so that all our students have the educators they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11668)|
| 3:14:35| one-on-one attention, inviting classrooms, and a well-rounded curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11675)|
| 3:14:40| In Knoxville, the state is a minority funder in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| Local taxpayers pay for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| Research informs us that charter schools are publicly funded but privately run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| They receive public funding, including local, state, and federal tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11693)|
| 3:14:57| However, they choose their own management structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| and do not have the traditional elected school board that is common to all traditional public schools in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11700)|
| 3:15:06| As a result, our district could find itself in a financial situation that could jeopardize our school district's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| to deliver on the promise to provide a free and appropriate public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| Our district will be hard-pressed to deliver adequate and equitable educational opportunities to fully meet our students' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11716)|
| 3:15:25| We cannot allow the polarization of this decision to potentially harm our student body and to lead further dissension in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11725)|
| 3:15:33| Let us come together to create a plan that will provide options to our children and adequate funding to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11733)|
| 3:15:40| Collaborative efforts with the community, KCS Board of Education, and the Knox County Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11740)|
| 3:15:46| will garner a sustainable future in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| Jeffrey Tallman, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| Just state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| Jeff Tallman. I reside at 616 Luttrell Street in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11760)|
| 3:16:04| To your point, here's a voice from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11764)|
| 3:16:10| My Rotary Club, I'm a Rotarian, but I'm not speaking on behalf of the Rotary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| Actually, these are my own words, my own voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| I'm not speaking for the Knox Preparatory School, though I am supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11778)|
| 3:16:26| My Rotary Club has a partnership with Sarah Moore Green for 20 years where we take books and read to 2nd and 3rd graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11786)|
| 3:16:34| We just outfitted the Vine Middle School soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| We just had a Rotary grant to help support the Austin East robotics team that just performed this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11799)|
| 3:16:48| I pay attention to education, and as a son of a public school teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11808)|
| 3:16:53| I pay attention basically to how all of us as a community, how we unlock our human capacity, our human potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11813)|
| 3:17:01| When I first heard of Knoxville Preparatory School's interest in Knoxville, I reached out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| come to Knoxville. We want to hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| My Rotary Club's involved with public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| We want to hear what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| There might be some good things to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| So Brad came up, and I was impressed then, and I've been impressed more every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11836)|
| 3:17:25| One of the things is, as you get older, at least I appreciate the things that sometimes make the difference are discipline, respect, and manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11845)|
| 3:17:36| Discipline, respect, and manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| It's not real complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| And I can tell you, every interaction I've seen from everybody at Chattanooga Preparatory School has been consistent in terms of their regard for their fellows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11859)|

| 3:17:53| I reached out to one of your award-winning middle school teachers, who I'll not name because I know what the repercussions will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11873)|
| 3:18:00| and I said, what do you think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| She said, we are failing that cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| We need it desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11885)|

| 3:18:10| That's one of your best and brightest school principals speaking on behalf of the urgency and the need for bringing this committed group of people to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11890)|
| 3:18:29| I live, like I say, nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11909)|

| 3:18:39| It's important to know, Mr. Watson, you raised the question of white saviorism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11919)|
| 3:18:48| The interesting thing about Knoxville's urban poor is it's 60% white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11928)|
| 3:18:55| And I'm not carrying water for white people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| In fact, I'm of just the opposite view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| We need partnership with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11939)|

| 3:19:37| Although my wife, Sandy, and I do not have children, we freely and gladly pay taxes to support public education, but not to support private schools like the one being considered by the board this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11977)|
| 3:19:51| The term public charter school is a total misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=11991)|

| 3:20:42| I expect them to be controlled in Knox County by Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12042)|

| 3:21:02| Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12065)|
| 3:21:09| Hi, Kim Kredich, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| I am the parent of three boys who went to Vine Middle Magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| And I feel very proud of what we loved Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| In fact, Ms. Hancock, whose words you read, was one of the boys' teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12080)|
| 3:21:27| One of our sons, now I've got 24, 24-year-old twins and an almost 22-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12087)|
| 3:21:33| So I am out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| One of the twins has autism, and he was one of the very few students with a pervasive disability to have the inclusive placement with an aide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12095)|
| 3:21:46| If he had gone into the placement that Knox County kept saying over and over he should have been, which was in a segregated CDC program, he would not have been able to go to Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12106)|
| 3:21:58| I had that confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| Because they would have said, we don't have the program to meet his needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12120)|
| 3:22:04| And I have to wonder, after talking with Brad, who answered a lot of my questions, he said, no, we would create any program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12124)|
| 3:22:14| We would include students on modified content in ACT courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12134)|
| 3:22:19| We would modify their content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12139)|
| 3:22:20| I'm thinking now, how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| We wanted to go to a magnet school, and we would not have been able to do that because of our son's placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12142)|
| 3:22:30| And yet, Chattanooga Prep is saying, yes, anybody can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12150)|
| 3:22:37| Well, Emerald Academy, to my knowledge, and I did ask around, and to my knowledge doesn't have a single student on alternate assessment, which is basically intensely modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12157)|
| 3:22:49| So wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| I look at you all, students, and I see my sons and their classmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12172)|
| 3:23:01| And I also think, every time I heard you speak your wonderful words of praise for your school, well, Vine did that for my sons and a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12181)|
| 3:23:13| What's missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| Why can't we replicate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| Vine was only 351 students back in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12197)|
| 3:23:21| 118 of them were out of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12201)|
| 3:23:24| Only 33 were magnet, and the rest of them, or almost the rest of them, were sent there instead of alternative schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12204)|
| 3:23:31| So we really need to look at, whether this is approved or not, let's take a look at what we're doing well and what we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12211)|
| 3:23:42| And why can't we have Vine just as successful as a charter school purports to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12222)|
| 3:23:49| You know, David and Goliath, everybody thinks Goliath is the strong one and David was the underdog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12229)|
| 3:23:56| Read Malcolm Gladwell's David and Goliath, and you'll see that a school like this, yes, with private money and everything, they are very nimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12236)|
| 3:24:04| And we feel like the big giant kind of stuck sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12244)|
| 3:24:10| So I support Knox County Schools 100%, and I think this gives us some perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12250)|
| 3:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| Paul DeLeon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| DeLeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| It's been a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12271)|
| 3:24:34| I'm Paul DeLeon, 630 Watauga Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12274)|
| 3:24:39| I'm a retired Knox County school teacher, but when I was a kid I went to private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12279)|
| 3:24:45| The staff meant well, but it was strictly amateur hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| They didn't know half what public school teachers bring to their first year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| And the all-boys prep school I attended, I have to say, it was bizarre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12292)|
| 3:24:57| You don't have to attend one of these places to have an idea what kind of culture develops when girls and women are forbidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| The idea that boys learn very differently, that they're somehow more mathematical, sports-oriented, or rational than girls, is based more on gender stereotypes than biology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12303)|
| 3:25:14| And the implication that the sight of a stray hair across a girl's student's forehead will irresistibly distract the poor, hormone-maddened boys is downright insulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12314)|
| 3:25:25| Why would we take from boys the chance to develop key social skills by working daily and respectfully with girls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12325)|
| 3:25:32| The justification for charter schools is innovation, not a throwback to medieval values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| My old prep school wised up and started admitting girls decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12337)|
| 3:25:43| And leave us not forget, when we segregate students, we can call it separate but equal, but it almost never is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| Let me address the slogan of parental choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| Freedom of choice is very important, except where it cuts down choice for the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12352)|
| 3:25:59| KCS families already have an array of options, magnet schools, academies, AP classes, the STEM school, and I don't know it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12359)|
| 3:26:06| If we had more money, we'd have more options in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| But when you subsidize charter schools, it's really the charters to have the choice, because they have many ways to get rid of expensive or low-scoring students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12370)|
| 3:26:21| Unlike charter schools, Knox County schools can't outsource services to students with special needs and cannot focus mainly on kids on the college track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12381)|
| 3:26:31| KCS must serve tens of thousands, not just a few hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12391)|
| 3:26:36| Yet approving this application will be taking resources from already underfunded public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| Which programs are you going to cut in order to pay charter companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| However you do it, I know the students in our neighborhood schools will have no say in the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12406)|
| 3:26:51| Sure, parents have every right to send their kids to private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| Let them do it on their own dime rather than taking taxpayer subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| Finally, I ask, what is the end game here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| Will you keep approving charters until all that's left of KCS are the students the charters don't want and whatever budget is left over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12422)|
| 3:27:10| How many neighborhood schools will you have to close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12430)|
| 3:27:14| Our school board has a choice, and the path you choose now will determine what will be left of Knox Public Schools in 10 and 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12434)|
| 3:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12441)|

| 3:27:45| We currently serve pre-K through 8th grade students after school in 10 Knox County school locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12465)|
| 3:27:52| We began serving the families of Carnes Elementary School in 2009, where we currently serve 106 pre-K through 8th grade students in the Carnes Annex building between the hours of 1 and 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12472)|
| 3:28:04| We also offer full day summer camp at Carnes from 7 to 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12484)|
| 3:28:09| We truly value Carnes Elementary School and the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| After school programming is key for many working families in the Carnes community as it provides students with a safe space to learn and grow while providing families with peace of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12494)|
| 3:28:26| We understand the need for additional pre-K classrooms, and we are eager to expand pre-K after school services to those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12506)|
| 3:28:34| We've been truly blessed to have dedicated space in the Carnes Annex building for the past 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| Currently, we utilize the quad in building B and two classrooms in building A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| We understand the need to be flexible when working in a shared space environment, and we have years of experience and insight to guide problem solving strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12525)|
| 3:28:55| As a licensed after school program, we are mandated to meet certain standards related to safety and space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12535)|
| 3:29:03| Although we can function without dedicated space, if a portion of our program needs to transition to shared space, we do need dedicated space appropriate for providing after school programming to the amount of students we currently serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12543)|
| 3:29:16| As decisions are made about the separation of Carnes Elementary and Carnes Preschool, our hope is that shades can have a voice throughout that transition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12556)|
| 3:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| Thank you. Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12568)|
| 3:29:31| Still back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12571)|
| 3:29:42| I'm Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12582)|
| 3:29:46| You know, I have to say that I have been impressed by what I've heard from Chattanooga Prep, Mr. Scott, and all the services that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12586)|
| 3:30:01| Their intentions are awesome, and I'm certainly impressed with the fine young men they have brought here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12601)|
| 3:30:11| You know, they talk about helping the community, collaborating mentors, internships, and they would like to see Knox Prep be part of the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12611)|
| 3:30:26| The thing that bothers me is they want to set up a school that will have, if everything they say is true, exceptional resources that far exceed what Knox County can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12626)|
| 3:30:39| And so maybe they will be able to serve 106th graders every year, but there's thousands who don't have access to these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12639)|
| 3:30:51| They tell us that they are absolutely not going to be cherry picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12651)|
| 3:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12656)|
| 3:30:57| But still, there's going to be many, many students who are every bit as deserving as these fine young men of the same kind of services that Knox County cannot afford, but somehow or other Chattanooga Prep thinks that Knox Prep can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12657)|
| 3:31:14| So if they can actually afford to do all these things that they say to do, why build a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12674)|
| 3:31:22| Why not invest those resources in all of our schools that need it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12682)|
| 3:31:29| I have to say, if they really cared about the students, the way they should show that is by supporting all of our students, all of Knox County students, all of them, the ones in Vine and Whittlesprings, Bearden, and all those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12689)|
| 3:31:49| Support them instead of just trying to select 100 that is going to be people that they can do something special with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12709)|
| 3:31:57| Every one of our kids deserve the same things that they're offering to these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12717)|
| 3:32:03| And so my request to you is say no to this application, but turn around and say, Mr. Scott, Mr. and Mrs. Ayling, come help us, but help us do what we need instead of trying to do it your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12723)|
| 3:32:19| Instead of coming in and plopping down your solution that will only help 100 kids a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12739)|
| 3:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| Candace, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12748)|
| 3:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| Hi, Candace Bannister, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| I'm going to try to talk fast because I was very impressed with tonight's questions, very impressed with all the information gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12757)|
| 3:32:42| I have two pages, and you can see there have been some edits along the way, and I'm still going to have to kind of go with a message, and then I may email all of you tomorrow after I've got a little more time to reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12762)|
| 3:32:55| I enjoy attending meetings because I always learn something I didn't already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12775)|
| 3:32:58| On March 1st, I attended the Charter Committee meeting with Knox Prep at Sarah Simpson, and I learned a couple things I'd like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12778)|
| 3:33:05| Of course, this group is excited and enthusiastic about their mission, and they have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12785)|
| 3:33:09| But I also heard more than once that they will be leaning into the district for some special services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12789)|
| 3:33:14| They want to be part of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12794)|
| 3:33:16| Their admin will attend the other admin meetings and desires to be mentored by your admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12796)|
| 3:33:21| Knox Prep will be leaning into Knox County for special services that weren't really specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| But being a retired teacher, I'm thinking, I don't know, speech, OTPT, SPED services, ELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12805)|
| 3:33:31| You all have had a tough time covering these positions in SPED this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12811)|
| 3:33:36| In fact, some are still vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| If you authorize this school, you'll have to meet their needs for these special services as well as your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12818)|
| 3:33:44| They'll reach out to our assistant superintendent of student supports for guidance, our legal department for legal counsel perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12824)|
| 3:33:50| and our finance department for some budget information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12830)|
| 3:33:53| They will use your staff to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12833)|
| 3:33:56| If you authorize this school, it isn't a short-term commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| It's a tenure commitment to share your resources and revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| Right now, money's pretty good. We've got ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| But your resources, your employees, maybe are not quite as plentiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| This leaning in to use your services will put more stress on your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| We have a lot of vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| Throughout NOCC's presentation to the Charter Committee, they focused on what they would bring to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12853)|
| 3:34:18| so much so that no one in the room could even stop to think about what they might be subtracting from Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12858)|
| 3:34:24| I feel authorizing this school will come at a cost to all of the 91 Knox County schools across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12864)|
| 3:34:31| On March 10th, I attended the follow-up meeting to put the recommendation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12871)|
| 3:34:36| In both meetings, I heard lots of questions from the people on the Knox County Charter Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| They were told over and over by the consultant that they didn't have to know how it would be done, but it's in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12881)|
| 3:34:48| For example, NOCC's prep said that they'll be fully staffed when they get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| given the issues that every employer, including KCS, has had with hiring since the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12891)|
| 3:34:58| It's a fair question, but instead of being able to dig into it, we were just told there's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12898)|
| 3:35:03| You know, this reminds me of going through the evaluation process myself as I was teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12903)|
| 3:35:09| You know, I have my objective, I have my plan, and I'll tell the evaluator that 90 to 100 percent of my students will master this skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12909)|
| 3:35:16| Am I going to get the 5 and B on my way? Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| You're still going to want to see that plan, you're still going to see that lesson, and you're going to want to see that student work for yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| According to Knox Board Policy B-112, it is your duty to vote and act impartially for the good of the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| Please take this responsibility seriously and do your due diligence. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12932)|
| 3:35:38| Thank you. Annabelle Henley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12938)|
| 3:35:46| Thank you, Annabelle Henley, Knox County. I want to echo Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12946)|
| 3:35:49| My son had a marvelous experience at Vine, and I would hate to see students not have the experience of this school with such deep community roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12949)|
| 3:35:56| I was going to bring up the same concerns about white saviorism as Board Member Watson, and I appreciate the answers that were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12956)|
| 3:36:02| It still feels a little like an expanding empire, to his point, Starbucks, and kids are not coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12962)|
| 3:36:08| For me, it's not about whether or not Knox Prep can do a great job of educating boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12968)|
| 3:36:13| Clearly, Chattanooga has proof that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12973)|
| 3:36:16| It all sounds wonderful, and the representatives who spoke tonight are very compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| I have no argument there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12981)|
| 3:36:22| This would all be great if they weren't doing it with Knox County schools money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| What happens to those who are left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12986)|
| 3:36:28| What happens to the boys who aren't able to get in, the ones who are left behind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| What happens to the girls when money is taken from their schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12991)|
| 3:36:34| My understanding is that a local predominantly black church was going to host the school, and they've pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=12994)|
| 3:36:40| And the gentleman who was going to lead the school has also stepped away, and the local office of the NAACP has said, please withdraw your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13000)|
| 3:36:48| One of our state representatives has also expressed his concerns with regard to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| The community that they say they want to help does not seem to want them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13012)|
| 3:36:57| They talk about wanting to raise future presidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| The community is worried about all the kids who aren't going to be presidents, the ones who will suffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13019)|
| 3:37:04| because money was siphoned away from their schools to educate the future presidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13024)|
| 3:37:08| I would love to see something in Knox County like Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13028)|
| 3:37:13| I wish the Owlings would form a foundation and provide these supports for all of our students who meet their demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13033)|
| 3:37:19| Take all the money that you're pouring into advertising and PR and put it into VINE, Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13039)|
| 3:37:25| Help all the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13045)|
| 3:37:26| Don't take money out of our community schools to help the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| Or take your money, open a free private school here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13050)|
| 3:37:33| Fund it privately, not with our county dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13055)|

| 3:37:55| Mr. Triplett, you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| Knox Prep is an inevitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| No matter who approves it, it's coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13079)|
| 3:38:02| What I think has failed to be considered here is who's going to pay for the Title IX lawsuits that's going to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13082)|
