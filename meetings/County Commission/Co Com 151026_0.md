| 0:00:53| I wish they would take note of the comments in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| That comment threw you off, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=57)|

| 0:03:00| Special Agent Derrick Dalton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| September 3, 2015, employee of Courtyard, Knoxville, Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| served our underage a Bud Light beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| She did check the informant's identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| That employee was working without the proper permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| Subsequent fine was administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| Also, I would add that Courtyard by Marriott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| has taken an identification class, which is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| that we are offering as a reduction in that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| They had a prior sale to minor, 9-17-2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Agent Dalton, I missed the point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| You said something without proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Was the employee not properly authorized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| She was not properly permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| The permit wasn't on her person at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| I don't know if she's obtained one since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=253)|
| 0:04:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=263)|
| 0:04:23| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| You said that they had taken a course last year in 2012?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| They received a citation in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| This time, we offered them also with the penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| to take an identification class, which I taught myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| personally, at their establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| with their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| So has that been done since this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| It has been done since this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| That was part of the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| as far as the ABC is concerned, as far as the penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| civil penalty that they paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Would we be out of line, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| to ask them what the ABC's fines are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| To ask them what their fines are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| You could ask them, but the relevance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| would be only to what your fines and the motions made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=314)|
| 0:05:24| Commissioner Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Were they cited for liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Or what brought the ABC in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| I guess, were you on a liquor sting that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Or are you all just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Yes, they have a liquor permit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And we were checking, finishing up some of the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| that we had not checked in Knox County for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Does beer affect their liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| An underage sale of beer affect their liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| It's in the code in 57-4203, liquor or beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| OK, I just checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Did you all assess a fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| Did ABC assess a fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| But they reduced it because they took this court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| I believe that was a prior event, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Have you assessed a fine for this offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| $1,750, if my memory serves me correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| And the reason for that being a little higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| was because of the sale to a minor from 2012 that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| That was adjudicated through the ABC because, or as liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| If not, thank you, Agent Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| I mean Dalton, Agent Dalton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Yeah, not necessarily for you, but I guess the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| This classifies double jeopardy if we're fining them twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| For the same offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Well, these are civil offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| So double jeopardy doesn't attach to a civil offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| If it were a criminal offense, it might be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| But these are civil offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| There's no incarceration or loss of liberty in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, Woofie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| When we conduct these sting operations with ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| and the Sheriff's Office, we kind of rotate around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| on who cites who so that one agency doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| have a whole bunch and the other one doesn't have many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| So we kind of share when we're working together on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| So that's why sometimes you'll have cited by beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| and sometimes they'll cite also on liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=474)|
| 0:07:54| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Captain May, did you cite them this time or would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| No, ABC cited them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| So you did not give them a citation this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Well, we don't have a county citation, where are we on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Yes, this is for Agent Dalton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| You said $1,750 was the gross fine and it was reduced to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| That was the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Normally, the first violation is $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| If they have a second violation within that three-year window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| then the license is scheduled for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| to determine the outcome of their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Our staff attorneys in Nashville decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| due to the time frame of being almost at that three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| period, to give them a fine which is in excess of $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| and for them to take that identification class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| I guess this is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Would it be OK for us to take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Any motion that this board wants to take, you could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| The situation here, and this is where it's really on the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| at least it's not a legal position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| but almost like a policy position for this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| to consider, they have been adjudicated for the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| that they have taken by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| And the state has the power to adjudicate beer, and so do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| So you can take whatever action, as it comes before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| as you deem necessary based upon the facts presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| I'd like to make a motion we take no action based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| on the state's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| And I appreciate the state and Wolfie working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| and understand why it's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| but I think the restaurant or the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| has paid a fine in excess of what we would have assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| them, and I think it would be unfair to double fine them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| while we're doing cooperative with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| You're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| At this time, we can call the dependent, Mr. Johnston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| There's a motion on the floor, this body can act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| First off, do you affirm or deny the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| that have been stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Do you have anything you'd like to say to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| I was not, I currently am the general manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| for the courtyard by Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| I was not the general manager in the prior violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| The young woman who made a very grievous error in judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| that evening by looking at the ID and then serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| has not only gone to court and paid her fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| she received disciplinary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| in the form of a written warning from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| She did have an ABC card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| She did not have it on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| And unfortunately, we keep a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I happened to be on a rare occasion out of phone contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Otherwise, we would have been able to produce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| I did work with the detective to not only hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| a class at the hotel, but opened it up to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| The detective needed to bring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| and I think we had about seven or eight individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| attend that class for that outside of our employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| And I believe the young woman understands the gravity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| of what she's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| And they are substantial fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| So I would appreciate any leniency you would give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| She's learned her lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| We meet weekly with the staff to ensure this does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| You had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Mr. Law Director, if we take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| this would be in conjunction with not added to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Is that the way we could do the ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Is it what you were saying before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| if we decide to take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| This board has something before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| and you have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| It's a pleasure of this board, however you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| But it's not in violation of any law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| if we decide to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I just want to clarify and make sure I have this correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| in my mind, that if ABC goes in and buys a beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| that person can be subject to two fines, one by ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| and one by us, if they hold a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| The statute allows ABC to charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| The only part that I have a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| me personally at this time, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| haven't done the research on it, is my feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| and that's why I appreciate Commissioner Anders' motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| is we have an adjudication at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| but we don't have anything at the county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| In other words, we don't have a site brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| I know that he has jurisdiction over beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| but it does give me a little concern that it's brought here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| and I'm not sure what the status is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| of what's brought before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| So you have a motion before you to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| In the last eight years, it's been very rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and we've seen quite a bit of it lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| and I just want to take this chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| for the Sheriff's Department and ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| to thank you for working together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| And it's not the first time that they've done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| and brought people up here, but we've not double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| fined anybody before, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Maybe that's a question we haven't asked ABC before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| when they've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| But it could be that circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| were a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| It was only beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| But with two agencies working like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| we've got a better handle on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| And he's taken steps to correct it in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| so I would go along with Brad's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| The motion that is properly before us is to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=903)|
| 0:15:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Can we have the, is there a way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| there's a few years ago that we had a pilot law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| was going to make where the ABC and the local bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| cooperated, and I don't know where that went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| but I would like for them to share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| I think they, we were shared with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| and they were to share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And so if there's a way to place that in that company's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| file for our local use for down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| And I don't know how we do that, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| in the clerk's office, if you would give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| a copy of the fine that we could put in their file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| with their permit, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| That's fine, we just want to do a better job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| and we're trying to work each day better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| with Knox County in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| There is that reciprocal law, which is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| what it's called, that if the ABC suspends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| the liquor permit, then you all as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| will receive notification through certified mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| and can take the same action of the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| as which that we have suspended the license for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Yeah, thank you, I appreciate y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| I do appreciate, go ahead, Kevin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I appreciate y'all working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| That's where the problem's gonna come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| because he's gonna take the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| and I'm gonna have the county, so you're gonna have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| two agencies on the same business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Yeah, but if they will share with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| we can put it in the clerk's file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Oh, you've already got it, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| We've already got a copy of the state fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| in the courtyard by Marriott's file in the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| so we'll have a history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| That's what we really want, is a history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| In the future, though, is what I'm asking, is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| I think what you did today was he's gotta show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| his value of his work to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| and you've gotta show your value to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| and I think if you swap them out every once in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I mean, we lost a little bit of fine money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| but it was still collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I think we're in good, I mean, my opinion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I think we're in good shape with how you're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1026)|

| 0:19:27| and if you were in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| if you have an employer in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| then you're not eligible for a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Okay, if he's still working with me, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| If you have, if you're still working with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1180)|

| 0:20:08| 10 more years to came back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| No, it means you can't have an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| who has been convicted of such an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1212)|

| 0:23:27| at the last time they were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| in regards to the corporation not having residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1408)|

| 0:30:11| So is this 180 Waterview Drive her address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1818)|
| 0:30:18| So she is a Tennessee resident then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Okay, that's what I'm trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, I guess just for future clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| so in terms of us granting these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| if there's a approved business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| within the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| then that's all we're concerned ourselves with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| If it's a corporation within the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| then a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| The rest of it doesn't matter, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| But it still bothers me that we have a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| gonna be running a business who's not a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| of the state of Tennessee or doesn't have a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| That's not, point of order, I guess my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| that's not germane to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| and we really shouldn't be asking those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| if it's not germane to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| That's why I was asking the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| It can bother us, but if it's not germane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| to the conversation, I don't know why we're having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| That's part of the questioning from the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| if you'd listen up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=1876)|

| 0:42:19| Please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| I'd like for this commission to look into a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Pull the microphone down just a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| so we can hear what you have to say, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Can you hear me there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| I would like for this commission to look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| the problem that I've got with Sam Cruz Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| that was created back in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| It has affected all my deeds to my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| and I can't get any headway here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| or upstairs in the deed department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| because of plots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| numbers have been changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| and I can show you with this map here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| what they drawed up upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| and saying where my property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| My property's all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| See, all my property comes off of Sam Cruz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| and Sam Cruz Road was changed in 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| by the councilman here, maybe not you people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| but it's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Now, all my deeds is scattered all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| I've tried to get it investigated, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| I spent $12,000 to a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| which he didn't do any good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| and another about seven surveyors I've had in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| They come in, they look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| shake their head, and they walk off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| and they say this problem is down here in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| I'm here to ask this councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| to do investigation into this situation I've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| and I'll be glad to show it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Mike Brown knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| He's been with me for about three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| trying to straighten this mess out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| That's not what I'm here for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| and it's gonna take a while for you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| what is going on and the people that's involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| I can prove everything I've got to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| or I wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Commissioner Brown, were you gonna make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2666)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| He's eating again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| First thing I'd like to do is ask Dwight to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| This is a situation, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| as he said, we've been working on it for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and haven't been able to come up with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| direct, indirect, or otherwise solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| as far as what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Jim Snowden from the Highway Department's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| They've looked at the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Mr. Myers just wants to get some kind of a definite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| plan down so he can kind of get his ducks in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| but as Dwight will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| according to what's needed upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| it's different than what Mr. Myers has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| so I don't know how that that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| and we haven't been able to figure out how it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| So that's kind of where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| If Dwight has anything that he can add to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Mr. Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Dwight Vandervate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| I've been out and met with a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and Jim has as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| and there are a variety of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| some of which are gonna be ultimately private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| or civil matters between Mr. Myers and his neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| but in one case, an issue of concern to Mr. Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| is that the alignment of Sam Cruz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| he believes is outside of where it originally should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| but unfortunately, the records of the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| reflect it where it sits today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| and we can't arbitrarily move it or replant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| A good alternative and one that we'd like to suggest again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| to Mr. Myers would be to request a right-of-way closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| for that portion of Sam Cruz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| where he controls both sides of the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| As the controlling property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| if we were to present that to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| I would assume it would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| that you would look favorably upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| There is a portion of the road from Hendron's Chapel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| to Mr. Myers' property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| where there are other adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| that have frontage on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| I do not think they would support a closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| but certainly for that portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| that Mr. Myers controls both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| it seems a reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Most of the other things that we've discussed with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I'm not sure are outside the scope of private civil matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| and I don't think we're gonna be able to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| but we have been out there a couple times over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Jim's been out there, I've been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| and I'll be glad to go back out there again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| but unless the facts and circumstances have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I'm not sure we're gonna be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| to bring him much relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Mr. Vendavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Commissioner Brown, did you wish to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Really? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| What Mr. Myers would like, and I don't know what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| A minute, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| I don't know if Dwight's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| would totally solve that problem or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| but, Dwight, if you're saying that if we closed his portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| of that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| So, this road is only, like, 200 yards long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| 300 yards at the most, of the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| If we closed his portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| would we have to have a dated right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| from the other adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| to open up a right-of-way through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Let me speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I'm not sure I follow you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| but if we could certainly close that portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| that is Amcruz, where Mr. Myers controls both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| we might have to help him build a hammerhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| or some form of turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| in order that he meets our road specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| just so that emergency equipment can turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| but the right-of-way is already open on the forward portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| on the northernmost portion of Samcruz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and that is where I think it would need to remain open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| because I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2924)|
| 0:48:44| the adjacent property owners would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Commissioner Oyenbee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Found it now near my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| I was looking for an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| As I look around the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I do not find that I see attorneys present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| as members of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| The problem that you have described to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I do not think can be solved in this big room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| without application from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| You will probably best be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| by getting continued legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2962)|
| 0:49:31| I try to get legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| And as I have said, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| there are no attorneys seated on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| There is nothing before us that we can work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Where Mr. Snowden says Samcruz Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| comes in up there is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Sir, we cannot change that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| I understand what you're saying, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| but what Knox County, what Mr. Snowden is saying is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| There is, the only thing he's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| is a plot map from a Jerry Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Now, I've got the files out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Sir, I cannot hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Let me finish this instance, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| It shows where Samcruz Road is when 1952 on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| And Mr. Snowden, when I returned my college call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| I could show him this and talk to him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Now, I know you don't know all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and that's what makes it real hard here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| for me to try to get you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| that I can prove it by your own records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| but what he's saying and what Mr. Snowden is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| is completely different to what your records show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| I'm still sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I do not see a course of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| before us here at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Mr. Myers, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| What if you and I and Mr. Vanderveet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| and Jim Snowden sat down together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| and looked at this map together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| We can meet down at Dwight's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Would that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I can give you two things here, and you could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Not in this position now, but just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3078)|
| 0:51:18| You need to get closer to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I can give you two things here right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| that will show you where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| You can look at it, and I can get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| But the way it sits right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| will you close that road or not, you kill my deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| because all those deeds I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| comes off of Sam Cruz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Now, Sam Cruz Road was moved in 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| by the councilman here for a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Now, they created this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| and it's cost me nearly $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| just to fight these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| keep them taking my property away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| And now, when you shoot Sam Cruz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| you're taking over half of my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and you're also taking a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Now, you tell me that's right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Sir, we cannot say whether it's right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| because we have nothing that we can do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| at this particular meeting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| What I'm asking, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| is that would you be willing to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| with Mr. Vanderbate, and Mr. Snowden, and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| and look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| I ain't got, I'm just trying to solve a problem here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that is affecting my deeds to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| I don't have, I pay taxes on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| but I don't know what I pay on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| because I can show you what they drawed up upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and my property is all on blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Commissioner Brown, if I could just make one suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| if we could add somebody, maybe Daniel Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| or somebody from Mr. Armstrong's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| that would probably help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| help Mr. Myers a little more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| than we've been able to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| But I think it's a great suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| and we're glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| That work for you, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| if we can set up a meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Does it work for you to meet with Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Mr. Snowden, myself, and get somebody from Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3189)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| The meeting will be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| for you to discuss that with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Further public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| I have no others signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Next is honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I think it would be appropriate to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| that we defer the item 101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| to the next regular scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Motion properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Now then, I need to do one other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| in front of Commissioner Schoonmaker's ask for the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| But I do need to make one point clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| November, whenever we speak about the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| the calendar of events for County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| for the months of November and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| everything moves up a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| The commission work session will be at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| November the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| And the regular beer board and commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| and zoning for the month of November will be November 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| If we could have Mr. Dwight Vandervate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| come back to the podium for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Earlier this month, Commissioner Bussler and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| had the privilege of attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| the Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| annual meeting in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And Dwight Vandervate was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| to their board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| And the board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| of the Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| is comprised of county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| county commissioners, and county road superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| So Dwight stepped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| and he is now the second vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| And he was duly elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| And so it's a great honor to have someone from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| serving on the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Also, we have another distinguished individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| who serves currently on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| and that is the county mayor, Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| So I just wanted to say thank you for stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| Your wealth of knowledge will be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| for the benefits of the other 95 counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3357)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3362)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| The devotional today is Commissioner Charles Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| Being not a public speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| and afraid to get up in front of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| I have invited my pastor from Sharon Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| to come up and speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| His name is Mark McCoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| and he will be doing the devotional for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3380)|
| 0:56:32| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Just want to share a word with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| begin with a word of scripture from 1 Kings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| the third chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| where Solomon ascends to the throne of Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| beginning with verse five of chapter three in 1 Kings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3413)|
| 0:56:53| At Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| and God said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Ask, what shall I give you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| And Solomon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| You have shown great mercy to your servant David, my father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| because he walked before you in truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| and righteousness, and an uprightness of heart with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| You have continued this great kindness for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| and you have given him a son to sit on his throne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| as it is this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Now, O Lord, my God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| you have made your servant king instead of my father David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| but I am a little child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| I do not know how to go in or go out or to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| And your servant is in the midst of your people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| whom you have chosen, a great people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| too numerous to be numbered or counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| Therefore, give to your servant an understanding heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| to judge your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| that I may discern between good and evil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| for who is able to judge this great people of yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| This speech pleased the Lord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| that Solomon had asked this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Now, I know that none of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| would be considered a little child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| as we gather this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| and the experience and the wisdom that you have gained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| are probably reasons you were elected to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| But as I thought about a word to address this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I thought about the responsibilities of leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| I know in my own experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| when I face tasks of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I have most often felt inadequate to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| And I think leadership should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| somewhat intimidating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| If you do not feel overwhelmed, at least at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| you probably just aren't paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| The wellbeing of a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| has been entrusted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and that should be a sobering responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| There's a lot we can learn from young Solomon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| as he ascended to the throne in Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| as he prepared to follow in his father David's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| very impressive footsteps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| as he realizes the weight of responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| that he will bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| as he recognizes that he is accountable to God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| as well as to the people for the decisions he makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| he's overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| For who is able to judge this people of yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| Solomon's approach to the challenge before him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| is what I think we all should seek to emulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| He prays for wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Therefore, give to your servant an understanding heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| to judge your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| that I may discern between good and evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Now, I'm a Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| and as a Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| my scriptures call me to pray for you as leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| In the New Testament, we find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| therefore, I exhort first of all that supplications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| be made for all men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| for kings and all who are in authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| in all godliness and reverence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| That means whether I voted for you or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| whether I like you or agree with you or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| whether you like me or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I am called to pray for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I don't know what your particular religious beliefs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| I assume that there's a variation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3628)|

| 1:00:34| But I do hope that you recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| that in order to lead effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| you need to draw from a wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| from some source greater than yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| And I pray that God will give this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| and its decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=3651)|

| 1:19:34| I really hate to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| but I think the news in the past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| about the educational status of graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| of high school in Knox County needs to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4784)|

| 1:19:52| and I'd like for you, if you would please, Dr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| to speak a word about the graduation rates of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Well, thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| First of all, let me say that we're excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| about having a 90% graduation rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| within the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| and it's been a concerted effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| I think over the past eight years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| that we worked on improving our graduation rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| from about 79% up to 90% this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and for the class of 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| and that's due to a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| on the part of our teachers, our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| and our parents, and so we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| It shows that the work that our teachers are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| on a daily basis is really paying off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| and we're just pleased with the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| So again, thank you for the recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| and we're just excited about the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| that's been done in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4852)|

| 1:22:25| here will put us at $50,000 and we will be able to match that two to one. And contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4945)|
| 1:22:35| can still be accepted to work toward the match, right? Well, to work toward the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| to the cost of the project. The match itself is in 50 days and this $25,000 puts us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| But yes, there are contributions because the total project is around $600,000, so total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=4969)|

| 1:25:18| maybe someone to talk about what this $1.5 million will cover and what the payback outlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5118)|
| 1:25:30| looks like. They'll start paying taxes sometimes. The $1.5 million from us will cover some renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5130)|
| 1:25:43| to the inside and outside of the facility. We also have talked with the city and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| going to hold us harmless on property taxes as they will own the facility. They will pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| us the current amount of property taxes, which is like $45,210, I do believe, annually. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| once the building is renovated and gets reappraised and that number will of course go up and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| work with the city on a new figure from there. But to the pinpoint of your question, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| $1.5 that we will put in will go toward interior and exterior renovations. Thank you. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5179)|
| 1:26:31| someone here from the chamber? So I'm going to support this. I'm glad that we're keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5191)|
| 1:26:40| jobs here, definitely. It sounds like we'll have a net of 75 jobs. I'm sure they're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5200)|
| 1:26:49| not paying jobs, but a majority of them are some really good jobs to keep in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| I guess my question is, and I know you probably tried and hit and missed, but I like the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5217)|
| 1:27:07| I do like the concept, and I'm going to say publicly that bringing jobs, redeveloping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| areas, but I'd like to see some new ones as well. I'd like to see some good hits on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| recruiting. This was a great retention in terms of keeping a quality business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5240)|
| 1:27:30| But I'm hoping that as our downtown is developed, redeveloped, that we're going to start getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5250)|
| 1:27:39| some wins from some other major corporate and industrial and entrepreneurs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| in a big way. Commissioner McKenzie asked if the chamber was here. Ms. Rice, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| responding to that question. I guess, Rhonda Rice, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Markets. You don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| have to. It's more of a statement, I guess. Okay. Well, I'm happy to comment, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| that in the last year, we had quite a bit of success with new companies coming in. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| of our largest projects that we had is a manufacturing company called Fresenius, over $140 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5292)|
| 1:28:19| was invested in Knox County alone for that one project, 650 new jobs. Just this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| week alone here in the region, we had more than 1,200 new jobs announced. And so there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| is a great pipeline of activity. Comcast announced 250 new jobs last Thursday as well. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5313)|
| 1:28:40| is a good streamline of activity. And just as important as the new projects are, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| got to take care of our own. And Regal certainly is one that we wanted to make sure that stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| here in Knox County. They are recruited very highly. They had a number of potential opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| And so we were glad that all the partners could work together to retain them here. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| you, Ms. Rice. Commissioner Busler. I want to speak to the mayor for a second. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| to applaud his efforts and his office efforts to keep Regal here. They are adding 70 new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5351)|
| 1:29:20| jobs, I believe, is what was said, in addition to what they're moving. Is that correct? 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| I believe. 75, I was five off of it. And it is going to be something for the county for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| them to keep. However, Mr. Mayor, you've made me very unpopular out in the halls area. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| I applaud your effort in keeping them here and the way the governor took care of it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| the way the city is taking care of it. We need to keep those jobs here. And I thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| you for your effort in doing that. Thank you, Mr. Busler. I would say that I ship a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| of dollars to halls via Litton's restaurant up there. I just take my check straight out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| there. And I would tell Commissioner McKenzie, part of the problem we have is that when business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| like Fresenius, which I believe for the record was the largest investment in the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| of this county, you know, you talk to business folks around the community and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| even realize that. And the main reason it is, is if the state touches a project, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| they have to control the media. And honestly, I'd rather call Michael Grider and get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| media for this end of the state, because he and Jenny Lingenfelter could handle that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| better than they have in the past. Now, with Randy Boyd there, he and I've discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| and they understand the importance of alerting the media and alerting the public to new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| You know, just last week was the major announcement out at Forks the River, where the, what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| the name of the pool company? Leisure. Yeah. Leisure Pools has decided to open up a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| manufacturing out there at the old boat, Sea Ray, Sea Ray, Sea Ray Boat Plant. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5458)|
| 1:31:07| you know, and they're getting better about it, but in the past I think they've honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| done a poor job of letting the public know. So, but I just thought that was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| that we know that Fresenius was the largest investment of a private entity into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| into our county, in the history of this county, probably outside of the university or one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| of the government entities, but that's something that should be noted. Thank you, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| for all your work at bringing jobs to Knox County. Commissioner Anders? Well, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| you know, again, I wanted to talk about the, you know, this was a homegrown company that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| started with one screen and I think it's important that, you know, the Hackney, the Hackney plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| driving by there in Roane County kind of still irks me a little bit that we're watching that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| walk out and we had jobs that left Knox County for there. And I want to commend the guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| that brought this deal together and I appreciate Regal wanting to participate because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| they probably could have went to a higher bidder somewhere else and I appreciate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| staying. Commissioner Oyenbee? Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, I want to echo this. The work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5526)|
| 1:32:14| the chamber has done, not just on this, but leisure pools and a lot of companies moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5534)|
| 1:32:24| their headquarters here. The FedEx building out in Hardin Valley is humongous and the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5544)|
| 1:32:32| that these companies are making in Knox County proves that we have the right atmosphere. We have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| you know, our taxes where we need to be and people want to live here. And keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5558)|
| 1:32:46| Regal is, I think, very important. I mean, I hate Halls. Lost it now they don't have it no more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| but sorry. But, I mean, I'm glad they're staying here and they're adding 75 more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5572)|
| 1:33:02| Like Rhonda said, Comcast is adding 250 new jobs and then that facility down there is just amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| what the work they've done down there. So we've got companies wanting to grow here and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| this is very important that we do this and I'm glad that everybody was able to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| and get it done. But I applaud you all. Thank you. Commissioner Brown? Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| I'd like to look at it from a little bit different angle. Sure, we're glad to keep Regal here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| it's great to have a homegrown company do good. I mean, you know, it's like the Cinderella story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| almost. But let's look a little further beyond that and beyond just the 75 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5621)|
| 1:33:49| Putting Regal there with the complex that they're talking about putting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| moves a great business and hopefully some of those people from Halls will move south and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| spend some money south. But it moves it across the river to the south part into my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| which that's immaterial at this point, but still growth follows growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| With the influx of them coming in with those apartments, condos, and what have you coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| a block away with another 2,000, 2,500 people, it has to make things grow. So just one extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| item coming like that can almost start the dominoes falling. And I think this is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| the key, one of the keys, to a great surge of development south of the river. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| load on the load. We've been waiting long enough for it. So thank you, Regal, and thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| mayors, and thank you, chamber, and all of those that worked on the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| Commissioner Bussler, you have the last word. I will have the last word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| and I hate to correct the county mayor, but Littons is not in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5699)|
| 1:35:10| Do we have public comment? Yes, sir. Yes, my name is Mike Whalen. I live at 1933 Island Home Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5710)|
| 1:35:19| Mr. Brown's district. And I'd like to slow this down just a minute. This is $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5719)|
| 1:35:29| out of what's purported to be $12 million for Regal's little deal. Now, that's not including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| the 30 years of free rent on this lease. And as a small businessman, I've never been offered a 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| year free rent-free lease. But Regal Cinemas, back in 2013, announced they were cutting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5741)|
| 1:35:50| hours of their hourly employees to below 30 a week, so that they would not have to provide health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| care. And this was because, they said, they didn't want to be forced into forced socialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| Now, I found that interesting at the time, since they had just opened their new movie theater on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| Gay Street under the forced socialism of the city building the thing for them. They didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| complain then, and I don't believe they paid the money back in order to get out of that bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| forced socialism. And then what do we find? Now we find that instead of the old days when we robbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| other states of jobs by offering cheap employment, cheap labor, and tax breaks, now we're offering it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5782)|
| 1:36:30| to move from halls to South Knoxville, 12 million dollars for a profitable corporation. And I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| think our priorities are a little screwed up here. I want to see jobs in Knoxville. I live in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| Knoxville. I want to see good things happen in South Knoxville, not just apartments. We'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| to have some other developments out in Knoxville. But I think this plan, having the details released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| last Friday and start voting on it on Monday, seems to me the kind of rush that makes some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| us citizens wonder about whether the deal is done before we get told about it. My last time I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| involved in county commission was when I was a plaintiff in the Black Wednesday incident a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| years ago, where things were getting slipped through and folks were disappearing into the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| hallway and coming out and changing votes. And I would just ask you to slow down just a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| bit on this idea, because it's not just 1.5 million. That's from the county. The package is enormous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| and if the rents they're talking about are 178,000 square feet for 325 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| and I'm hearing 75 new employees, but the details I'm reading says they get to keep this deal even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| if they cut their current employment to 250. So once again, we're offering up lots of money, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| we're not really getting guarantees. And these folks are in this lease now, but they also took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| a Chapter 11 back in 2001 in order to restructure, and what'd they do? They got out a bunch of leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| they didn't like. So I'd ask you to look at this a little more carefully. I don't know why anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| would want to get out of a sweetheart deal lease like this, but before we throw a little money into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| big money, I'd just ask you to look at the details, and maybe it'd be nice if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| Regal would guarantee something on their end instead of just throwing all this money out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| and finding out that next week they'd rather be in Hardin Valley. It doesn't seem too much to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5909)|
| 1:38:36| in a time when money is supposedly tight that we make sure we're spending it wisely. And I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| know, you look at that 12 million, start dividing that by 325. Those better be some pretty good jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| because you're paying what would be market rate to employ most of those folks just in tax deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you. Thank you, sir. Seeing no further lights for discussion, motion properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. Motion carries. That completes the regular agenda of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5942)|
| 1:39:12| commission work. Next is discussion items. Madam Clerk. Discussion regarding rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5952)|
| 1:39:22| We had a discussion of rural metro and this is on the contracted service of providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| ambulance service in Knox County at the work session. I said it would be held over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| for any further discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| Yes, Commissioner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to add one thing to this discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| our emergency service in Knox County. To me, this is something very important, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=5990)|
| 1:40:01| sheriff's department, police, fire department, all these emergency services and things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6001)|
| 1:40:10| when we least expect it, we need them. I just want to make sure that everybody understands that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6010)|
| 1:40:19| is involved, responsible, has something to do with these contracts and with working it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6019)|
| 1:40:28| and making sure we have this coverage. I hope that this body will always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| hold everybody responsible to make sure, especially I think of our seniors, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| of people I know, they're in their 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| When they need an ambulance, we need to make sure, we need to know it's going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| in a respectable amount of time. The reports we've had so far, from what I understand, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| met that level. I just want to make sure as we go forward, we need to always make sure these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| are done according to their contracts as best we can because we owe a big responsibility and duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| especially to our senior population, that one day may need these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| Thank you. Commissioner Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd just like to add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| Commissioner Thomas's comment and the fact that this was an interim inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6091)|
| 1:41:40| whatever you want to call it, but it's important that these things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| between contract times on a regular basis or a surprise basis or whatever to be sure that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| citizens of Knox County are being served and served properly. So I think based on what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| found during this particular investigation, they were in pretty good shape, but I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| people need to know that and I think they also need to know that if something else comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| we're going to be right back out there checking. So whether it's them or there's any other department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| Commissioner Hornby. Yeah, thank you, Chairman. Yeah, I took the advice of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6138)|
| 1:42:27| Commissioner Anders last week about going out there and visiting. If nobody's visited this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| 8911, you need to go. It's well worth the look to see how it all works, how it all comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| It's a big operation and it's well above my pay grade, but I mean they were very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| forthcoming with every question. They answered every question I had to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| I'm not saying that stuff wouldn't come up down the road and we need to investigate. We need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6176)|
| 1:43:03| look at everything that comes down and I told them I'll be if I get calls, I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| definitely calling them. I want to know this call, how long did it really take and all this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| they keep pretty good and it's not just them checking it. There's a third party that checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| this that balances it and then it goes to also Dr. Buchanan's office that kind of looks at it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| and I feel confident that Dr. Buchanan's checking everything and watching over the interest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6207)|
| 1:43:35| Knox County to make sure the contract's followed and if it's not, they're paying fines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| they're paying fines every month, but that's I mean that'd be anybody. Any ambulance service we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| had, you're going to miss time frames and all this stuff, but I feel pretty confident that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| they're doing a good job and then that doesn't mean that we need to slack up and not continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6233)|
| 1:44:02| to monitor it and look at it and if there's a problem we need to get in there and find it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| if you haven't went, I suggest you go and look at the operation. It's really impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6247)|
| 1:44:17| There has been an invitation extended to commission for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| and I'll use the words I heard, lunch and learn. Is there any consideration that commission would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| give to scheduling a one-time meeting which would come under the category of lunch and learn with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6271)|
| 1:44:41| the rural metro commissioner? Yes. Is it 9-1-1 or rural metro? Rural metro is the one that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6281)|
| 1:44:50| extended the invitation to visit, but that's where the visit would be too. Absolutely. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| now then we're going to have to work on a meeting date. Let me hold that for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Commissioner Smith. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. If we did a meeting there at the 9-1-1 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6303)|
| 1:45:11| it would have to be a publicly noticed meeting and the media and public would be welcome to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| Is that possible? Yes. There's a board room that seats about 50 over there. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| Well, rural metro has a large training room. It could be in Hardin Valley either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| This is not 9-1-1 specifically, but it's rural metro's operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| They said they could accommodate it over at the... Yeah, there's plenty of room at the 9-1-1 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| But if you go to the 9-1-1 center, you see all of the agencies working together. It's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| rural metro. Yeah. And the fact that to me it's amazing that they all can work together and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| as much as they can with, you know, so many different people involved. So, I mean, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| over there as part of the Sheriff Academy's school and spent an evening over there. So, I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| a fantastic place. Ma'am, did you wish to speak? No, I just wanted to reiterate the fact that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6363)|
| 1:46:12| I need your name and address for the record, please. Yes, Erin Downey, 10140 Gallows Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| Knoxville 37931. I just wanted to reiterate the fact that we welcome you to come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| 9-1-1 center and the 9-1-1 center specifically because you can see the collaboration between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| the different departments out there. We are in the same center as the Sheriff's Department, KPD, KFD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| and we work side by side with them on the same computer-aided dispatch system that they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| So, we really enjoy showing you the transparency that we have within this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| And answer any questions that you have right now as well. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you, ma'am. The question that's before us is if we want to participate in something called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| Lunch and Learn at the 9-1-1 center, we'll have to come up with a date and time that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| Well, my question would be, if you go at night, it's going to be much more busier, but would they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6424)|
| 1:47:14| have time to do the explanation in, or would we be better off going at lunchtime where you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| everything and it's going to be on a lesser scale because you don't have as much stuff going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| the middle of the day. But to me, that would be best because you can get a better idea and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| able to, in a lot of cases, talk with the people that are actually doing it. But at night time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| if they're all wrapped up with homicides and fires and everything else, accidents all over town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| your chances of doing that are slim to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| I would say daytime would lessen the impact of their operation if we went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| but there's more people there. Commissioner Albee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Yeah, I agree. Lunchtime would probably be better because I was there in an evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| and it was on a slow evening, but it was still pretty busy. So, I would say lunchtime would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| probably be the better chance for everybody to really see the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| So, since this is a scheduling exercise, I would ask that our expert help in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6492)|
| 1:48:27| out an email to commissioners giving a request that you respond with a couple of three choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| of when would be best for you individually and we'll work from there getting a scheduled date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| if there be no objection. Any further discussion on the ambulance service contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6520)|
| 1:48:49| The next item of discussion is regarding fire protection. We had a discussion of that at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6529)|
| 1:48:57| work session and I requested it be held over to see if anyone wanted to speak any more to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6537)|
| 1:49:06| fire protection. The reason that we have to do something is because the committee that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6546)|
| 1:49:15| appointed had a sunset and if we are to do further work with this committee, it'll have to be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6555)|
| 1:49:24| form of a resolution establishing that committee ongoing, but that does not preclude us from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| other discussions about fire protection. Commissioner Anders? Yeah, Dr. Caldwell and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| myself and Hugh are going to Hamilton County, I think in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| and so I will be happy to bring back their programming if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| We're just going to spend the day down there with their emergency services director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| Dr. Caldwell? Dr. Caldwell. What day is that? I don't remember. What day was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| Hugh, I think it was December the 3rd maybe or the 2nd maybe. I think it's December the 2nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| because I don't think I'm traveling on the 3rd. It's my daughter's birthday. I better not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| Commissioner Bussler? I want to speak to the fire protection because I was on the first committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| on that and I went out and I surveyed my district where all the fire hydrants were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| I surveyed where and how we could get to each place in my district from those fire stations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| how long it would take driving a car, not a fire truck, but I was in that and did all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| information. The problem of it is when I started I thought what you need to do is be the inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| of what you have in each district. The need that you would have to do to improve it and what level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| that you wanted to be at and how much it's going to be staffed and then how much the cost is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| to be before we start anything else. I did that for my where everything was at and it's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6652)|
| 1:51:01| strange that we don't have a goal that we said that we're going to go visit this but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| have a goal what we're going to do. We don't have a budget we say we're going to have to have for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| and you do all that information search that you had on it and nothing was ever done with it. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| what do we expect to get out of this is my question and from the information we gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| what are we going to do with it. So beforehand before we get into this we ought to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| discussion about where we're going to go not we're just going to start but where we're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6688)|
| 1:51:35| because you're going to have to ask the public to pay a heck of a lot of money to get any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| better protection than what we've got now. So I'm just saying I hope that we get use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6699)|
| 1:51:48| information we already have or get information as a survey in our county before we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6708)|
| 1:51:56| or we'll be wasting our time. What's the sunset date on your committee? It's already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| It's already passed. It passed in September I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| Thank you Commissioner Bussler. I think that the results of the visit to Hampton County will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| bring us some possible openings into a discussion of what might fit what might be modeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6735)|
| 1:52:25| here in Knox County. That opens the discussion as you're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| There are no other discussion items on today's agenda and I would like to say I think it brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| us down to three things. First I want to re-emphasize the calendar for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6759)|
| 1:52:47| The calendar for next month is changed. We meet all of the the two regular meetings of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| a week early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| Commissioner Smith. Go ahead. The second of the three items that we need to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| has to do with Gibbs Middle School. Now I've seen the mayor's staff vacate the room whenever they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| think everything's over but I need to think thank that that's a very important person standing back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6794)|
| 1:53:22| there. Dr. Caldwell. Dr. Caldwell. Moneybags. Another person I need to name specifically is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6802)|
| 1:53:33| Colonel Julian and then the most important person I need to name is Mayor Burchett for the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6813)|
| 1:53:41| that was conducted coordinating the budget with county commission and with the board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| to achieve a Gibbs Middle School being in the current budget. A big thank you party was held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| Saturday a week ago in the Gibbs community. I think they planned for 500 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| The only thing they had left was about three dozen hot dog buns because some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| elementary school kids didn't want a hot dog with a bun. They just wanted a hot dog. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| I need to say thank you commissioners for the help that you'd given the folks in the Gibbs community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| at now looking forward to a Gibbs Middle School. Now then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6862)|
| 1:54:31| Okay. Commissioner Bradley. Yes. Yes please. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just want to thank everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| who came out last Tuesday night when we were out in Hardin Valley at the Food City. It was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| overwhelming the response that we had to this open meeting. I want to thank the county highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| and service department for being there. They had three employees out there who answered all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| questions from the community. Many commissioners were also out there. Jeff thank you for coming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| John appreciate you coming out there and answering questions and I was looking you couldn't hardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| hear because there's so many people and and I was looking at the other commissioners and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| in little groups with people even though it wasn't their district they were still working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| within that and and thank you Brad for being there in your district too and I tell you it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| one of the most interesting meetings that we've had for some time and also Dave was out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| eating fried chicken. I always enjoy your all's meetings because it gets go somewhere and eat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| my wife's not excuse me the staff's not shaking a finger at me. Very good fried chicken by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| Thank you very much. Commissioner Smith. Thank you Mr. Chairman. First I want to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| Sam's birthday is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| And his wife's in a very tasty present over here. She's in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| As every one of us that serves on commission knows that sometimes our families have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| sacrifices for us to be here to do our duty and not only is it Sam's birthday today it's also my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| wife's so instead of selling her celebrating my birthday with her I'm celebrating Sam's birthday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| with him so I'd like to take this opportunity to say happy birthday Sharon. I love you and thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| you. We can sing. Okay everybody we're going to sing happy birthday to you happy birthday to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=6981)|
| 1:56:41| I'm not sure if PBA had enough insurance on this audio equipment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| If there be no further business we are adjourned. Zoning will be at seven o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| Order this the October zoning commission meeting. Madam Clerk you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7011)|
| 1:57:00| Commissioner McKenzie here. Commissioner Boyles is absent. Commissioner Smith here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| Commissioner Ornby here. Commissioner Schoonmaker here. Commissioner Anders here. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| Bussler here. Commissioner Wright here. Commissioner Brown here. Mr. Thomas here. Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| here. Ten members present. Ten members present. For something to pass it still requires six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7035)|
| 1:57:23| affirmative votes. There are before us five items tonight. Commissioner Anders. I was going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7043)|
| 1:57:31| if we could the last item I know it says move at the request of the sponsor to march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| I think there's two people here and we could probably release them if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| we push that forward a little. If there is no objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| from the board that will be deferred until March of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| No objection. Do we need a motion? No objection. It will be on the March of 2016 agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| We need to tell them which one it is. The last one. 6F15RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| Huber Properties. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7084)|
| 1:58:11| And now there are four. Madam Clerk first item. The first item is 9-D-15-RZ. It's a request of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| Eric Mosley for rezoning from VP business and technology and a agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| at a density up to five dwelling units per acre. Properties located south side of Bob Gray Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| north side of Dutchtown Road, west of Bob Kirby Road, and the third commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| Yes. Arthur Seymour Jr. 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. I am here on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7119)|
| 1:58:47| of the applicant. We are in agreement on the zoning recommendation with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7127)|
| 1:58:55| If I may proceed and explain that objection. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| MPC recommended plan residential at five units per acre, which is satisfactory with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7142)|
| 1:59:12| The property you are considering, and this is the concept plan which has been filed with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| is irregularly shaped fronts on Dutchtown Road, which is a three-lane road that connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7160)|
| 1:59:28| Cedar Bluff back to Pellissippi. It's a very fine road. It's not heavily traveled except at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| rush hour. To the north is Bob Kirby Road. The condition we are objecting to is the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7176)|
| 1:59:46| that there be a connection between this subdivision and Bob Kirby Road. The intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| is to have the main entrance down here on Dutchtown Road, which is the good road. I'll say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| it's a three-lane road. You all recently approved, and they were recently constructed, traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| circles up here. This one is Bob Kirby Road that connects Dutchtown to, let's see if I've got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7206)|
| 2:00:19| straight. I've got too many Bobs. There's Magrid Hood that comes up here. There's a traffic circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| there. Bob Gray comes across here. There's a traffic circle here. Some people object to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7224)|
| 2:00:33| traffic circle. If we are required to have a connection at the back to Bob Gray Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7233)|
| 2:00:45| this will result in this road acting as a thoroughfare for certain motors to want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7245)|
| 2:00:53| avoid the traffic circles. There are approximately 100 units that will be developed in here. As I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7253)|
| 2:01:01| understand MPC's rules, until you get to 150 units, you do not have to have an exit or a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| entrance into the subdivision. Homeowners in Knox County and seemingly everywhere prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| subdivisions that have one main entrance. There's a good reason for that. It gives them a sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| security. People patrolling the neighborhoods who are up to mischief, burglars and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| do not have but one way out, and that's the way they came in, which makes these less attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| to burglars and people stealing cars and what have you. Furthermore, it gives them a sense of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7298)|
| 2:01:47| for their children. The lots that sell for the highest are those on cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7307)|
| 2:01:56| frankly. Those are very popular. This will have four cul-de-sacs here. There will be one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7316)|
| 2:02:04| one here, one here and one here. We're asking that that condition be removed for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| Otherwise, we're going to end up with our main road here becoming somewhat of a thoroughfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7332)|
| 2:02:20| for people going from Dutchtown Road back here to Bob Gray Road. We would like to ask that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| condition be removed, that there only be one entrance, the main entrance off Dutchtown Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| into the subdivision. You'll find this, if you look at all the subdivisions around this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7353)|
| 2:02:41| they all have one entrance in and have cul-de-sacs throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7361)|
| 2:02:50| Are there questions, Commissioner Schoonmaker? Yes, can we hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| Metropolitan Planning Commission as to why they required a dual entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| Yes, sir. Mr. Green. Gerald Green with MPC. There were two primary reasons. One was traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| management to allow those who live in the subdivision to have two potential routes instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| of just loading all the traffic on one highway. The other was safety. If there were an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| at the one intersection, an access point to the subdivision that emergency vehicles and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7398)|
| 2:03:26| would have a second route. This is something that MPC will be looking at based on my direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| actually, to look at where we require connectivity, what that connectivity should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| be. I guess I'm one of those weird people who doesn't want to live on a cul-de-sac street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| has never lived on a cul-de-sac street, except for the four months I've been here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| and will be moving soon from that. Just from a safety standpoint and traffic management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| although I certainly understand Mr. Seymour's position here and that there is not a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| for that, it was merely a recommendation, and I understand his concerns with this and not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| it beforehand. We have no strong objection to this, and as I told one of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| before the meeting, we'll keep asking or recommending this until we do a thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| review and have opportunity for input and an ordinance amendment. We'll keep recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| in appropriate places or those we feel appropriate a second access into subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| Okay. I was just going to say, my neighborhood has about 190 homes with one entrance, and years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7466)|
| 2:04:34| we had the potential of opening it up to a second entrance, and one of the reasons, like Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| said, the Sheriff's Department said, you guys are crazy, don't ever have more than just one entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| and that is a crime preventer. So Mr. Seymour is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| I'd rather have two entrances for the police as opposed to one exit for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| criminals, but it's all different perspectives. I appreciate that, and again, I understand Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| Seymour's concerns, and we have no strong objection to the removal of the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I make a motion that we approve this at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| PR one to five units an acre with no conditions. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| We finished. Commissioner Brown. Well, maybe you want to restate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7523)|
| 2:05:30| Commissioner Smith. What is the condition? Is that the one condition that's mentioned here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| Mr. Green? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That is the only condition? Yes, sir. I just want to be sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| there wasn't something else that you all had. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7543)|
| 2:05:53| Was the request for up to four units per acre? Five. Oh, it was one to five. Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| Yeah, 120 homes. And also, while we're backing up for just a second, is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| Motion is properly before us. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7576)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you, Mr. Seymour. Madam Clerk, next item. 9-C-15-RZ is a request of John King for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7586)|
| 2:06:35| from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential. The property is located southeast side of Bob Kirby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| Road, southwest of Middlebrook Pike in the 6th Commission District. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7600)|
| 2:06:49| Is the applicant present? I make a motion we move to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| Second. The motion is before us to move this agenda item to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom151026?start=7615)|
