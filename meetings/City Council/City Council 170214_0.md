| 0:01:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=88)|

| 0:01:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=94)|

| 0:01:40| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| I'd like to postpone item 12A for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Item 12A for the audience is the beer permit holder issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| And that's for how many weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| And Mr. Frost and Ms. Dyer are working on a situation that involves this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| We think it will be resolved by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| The will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| I'm fine with postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| But I guess I was just wondering, is this going to come back, too, in addition to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| The ordinance that comes on the people who want to have self-serve will be a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| category of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| So if you apply for a beer permit and you want to have a self-serve, like poor ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| you would apply for that type of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| If you apply for a regular on-and-off premise, then you would apply for the permit that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| I guess I was, I mean, would it make more sense to withdraw this and then bring up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| new ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| No, because we still need this one to clarify the on-off premise if you are a non-poor place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| Aha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| That's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Well, I'm glad I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Mr. Frost and Ms. Dyer have met with the poor folks for a long time, and I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| moving really far along to getting this done by the time poor needs a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Now I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| So this would apply to all the other permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| So we have Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Oh, now it comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I thought maybe it was Mr. Dellavopi's that they turned off permanently, you know, instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Yes, I would like to postpone 12GH and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I have to vote on this one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| I thought you had a comment on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Just hold that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| So we have a motion and a second to postpone 12A for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| The ayes have it, and that is postponed for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Now, Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| I'd like to postpone 12GH and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=233)|

| 0:16:44| Della Vothe. Chad Wythe if you can find a way to break out of that aisle. Actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Rachel. Okay just tell us briefly about this. It looks like a five-year program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| to expand our hazardous waste facility but but you're talking about taking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| to other counties as well with a mobile device. Just explain the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| because it's a pretty big upgrade I guess. Yes it is. Okay so a household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| hazardous waste or HHW it basically refers to chemicals, cleaners, solvents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| paint related items that people are accumulating in their houses. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| right now at the transfer station we have one of four permanent HHW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| facilities in the state of Tennessee and it's free to Knox County and city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Knoxville residents. It is jointly funded through the city, Knox County, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| state of Tennessee. We have concerns in the state and the county also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| concerns that people are unaware of the dangers of accumulating this in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| house. They don't know where to take it. They may dispose of them illegally or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| dump them down the drain or just out in their backyard. So the state is offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| us well they have a grant proposal out right now to expand the HHW facility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| do just facility upgrades at our current facility and then also offer funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| mobile operations. So we would be performing the operations within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| county itself but you know if you're on the edges of the county you may not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| if these are coming from inside or outside of the county. The request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| the capital improvements at our transfer station it's for three hundred and fifty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| thousand dollars and that's 100% reimbursable and that's going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| both the employees that work there and the public as well. The $75,000 is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| the mobile collection vehicle that's also 100% reimbursable and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| operational request that's a five-year request. We're requesting that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| increases their contribution to two hundred and forty five thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| a year over five years and then the city and the Knox County contribution would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| not be changing over that five years. What is the city match? Does the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| have a match or not? Yes the city and the county currently do eighty five thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| a year. Okay well thank you. Any other questions? I want to recognize a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| job that Rachel's doing in all of this. She's had the rollout of the carts for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| the garbage and all of these projects like these two we just approved. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| you for doing a really great job. Thank you. Okay so we have a motion and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| second. All in favor say aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 12B is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1156)|

| 0:19:38| The ayes have it and so ordered. 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Code appendix B zoning regulations to update the city of Knoxville parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| ordinance. Vice Mayor Greene. Yes Mayor I'd like for Mr. Greene to discuss this for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1187)|
| 0:19:57| moment. We think there are some changes that we might need to send this back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| MPC. Okay Mr. Greene. Thank you. Mayor, members of Council, this amendment came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| before MPC originally in September. They recommended approval. Subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| to that the City Council held a work session on this in which public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| was received. Subsequent to that public input there was more public input all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| which resulted in some revisions. The revised amendment was sent back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| They reviewed the proposed revisions, recommended approval of them at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| January meeting. Subsequent to that meeting more public comment has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| received and some comment from Council members resulting in additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| revisions to the to the proposed ordinance based on the direction from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| the City Law Department. These revisions would have to be reviewed again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| by MPC and I say that knowing that this feels more like Groundhog Day than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Valentine's Day. I think it is. The proposed amendments do warrant additional public review and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| consideration of MPC before they're brought back to deal with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| landscaping provisions. There's also a new category of business that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| identified for which we need to identify the required parking spaces and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| I'll receive more comments before MPC reviews this again. I would request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| it be sent back to MPC for consideration of the proposed revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| Councilwoman Palmer. Well thank you. I have received some concerns since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| workshop also. One of them has to do with the office space. Today in office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| buildings and office spaces we have cubicles where if you're lucky you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| make a half turn to get in and out which of course means that you can fit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| people into your space. So the proposed maximum number of parking spaces is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| sufficient for many offices. As we've discussed before no business is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| ask for more parking spaces than they need because then they have to pay to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| keep them maintained. So what I would like to comment that one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| corporations in Knoxville if they had had to go with the maximum number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| spaces recommended here they would have moved to Alcoa instead of Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| we didn't need to lose them at all. So what I am going to suggest is that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| number 37 that the number of parking spaces for offices be increased to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| per thousand square feet. Is that in a table? It's in the table. Item 37 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| table is 9 of 23. It's 4 now. 4 is the max for 1,000 square feet. It would go to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1368)|
| 0:23:05| Okay so that's really for MPC to consider. Correct. Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| Is that? Thank you. Councilman Della Vopi. Yeah I'm just wondering we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| beat MPC to death here when we're going to have Commons forever. I noticed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| some of the remarks you had stated well once we get a plan in place we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| to reevaluate it at least on an annual basis or in the first year to see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| it's working. My question is for something like this table which has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| caused a lot of consternation for some businesses can we think about a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| that allows people to show why they need more independent of changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| numbers in the table. In other words this is the standard that we are shooting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| but there will be some businesses it won't fit. I know you have the 20% rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| if you can exceed it by 20% if you make it an impervious surface. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| whether that works or not but could there be some other kind of safety valve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| so that they can address the reasoning of why they need more for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| particular business. My opinion is that the safety valve in the proposed draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| is adequate. That safety valve is that if the maximum is exceeded by up to 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| those additional excess spaces would have to be impervious surfaces. If it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| to if the desire is to exceed the maximum by more than 20% all the excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| spaces would have to be impervious surfaces and a parking setting would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| have to be provided. This to a large extent. That goes to staff then at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| point? It all goes to staff and for the there's a similar provision at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| minimum once if the applicant or developer or property owner wants to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| below the minimum they present a parking setting. We purposely have left the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| definition of parking setting nebulous. It can be a report from the from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| property owner showing that they improving to staff that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| adequate parking if they want to go below the minimum have adequate parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| have addressed their parking needs thoroughly and provide some documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| of that. If it's they desire to go above the maximum would be similar maybe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| the corporation based in Mumbai who has their standards developed in Mumbai has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| no recognition of what Knoxville needs but they want to develop in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| and they feel they need more parking and they provide a parking study that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| based on their national or international experience and we would review that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| in all likelihood if it's a reasonable request well if it's a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| request would grant that request. Does that seem to be like the number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| comment when we had that Lakeshore workshop there were some people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| were pointing out specific businesses that this just didn't work for. Yes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| we revised a number of those based on the comments from the three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| people who had those concerns at the at the workshop worked extensively with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Peter Aarons and the plans review department based on his experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| working with these and we understand that on both ends there will be outliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and will be some businesses that want fewer parking spaces and some want more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| and we tried to make it as simple as possible knowing that excess parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| spaces and that pavement do have significant impacts on the city those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| are sure you know the first one's aesthetic more real or the heat sink the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| the cost of setting that area aside for the storm water and everything water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| right okay as long as you've got what you think is a reasonable safety valve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| because it's going to probably take some trial and error under this new set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| regulations you want to have a way to proceed without doing what miss Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| suggested someone leaving the area rather than working it out so it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| like a good thing that you have thought that through and we'll be working on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| overall ordinance zoning ordinance update what we already are and the we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| talked with the consultants and even the parking these parking standards will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| reviewed by them to ensure they work and we'll have that year or so of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| and we bring that draft zoning ordinance to you thank you vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| great thank you Gerald and I've had discussions over the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| the last couple of weeks and it was brought to my attention that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| type of business that's coming to town or it is here it's called a hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| convenience store QSR with gas and what it what it is it's a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| that actually serves food inside but they don't have a driving window and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| they have requested that we take a look at another item because it doesn't fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| under a convenience store with gas and it doesn't fall under a restaurant for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| the drive-thru and so we've requested that that be looked at in terms of a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| category with a minimum of four parking spaces and a maximum of ten spaces and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| some of you folks may have been down to Atlanta or some of the other areas in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| the south where there's a couple of these convenience stores called quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| trip sheets or wah-wah I like that one wah-wah and basically what happens is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| that you know in a regular convenience store you you park you run in you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| what you want you run out these convenience stores will have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| full kitchens and will prepare they'll have full menus and so therefore they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| provide seating areas so they would like to have more parking and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| special category so I'm asking the MPC to look into that also there's a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| category. Councilman Wallace. Yeah thank you. Is there some national standards at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1730)|
| 0:29:00| all that we can go by instead of it just being what I think or what a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| developer thinks or is there some way to address it on a standardized basis? Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| sir in developing these we looked at the parking standards and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| American Planning Association's parking manual and also looked at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| developed by the Urban Land Institute those somewhat typically going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| increasing the maximum realizing that Knoxville is probably more auto oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| than the average city so we use those as a base and built on those again using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| the experience that primarily that Peter Aaron's had from providing permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and watching the the businesses here in Knoxville and then listening to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| comments we've received and in most cases we have increased the maximum so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| I think there was one comment with the home furnishing store where we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| reduced the minimum but overall we've increased the maximum pretty much on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| I'd say seventy percent of these from what we had originally and even those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| were the maximum was above the maximum that's typically in the APA standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and the ULI standards. I think that I mean that sets the tone for what I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| because I don't know what parking standards are for a particular and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| have to I think none of us do I think we're I'm gonna have to rely on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| those national standards are by either architects or ULI to come to otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| we'll argue about it all the time. I think that the twenty percent while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| talking about what our wish lists are I wish there was a little more room and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| you had twenty parking spaces you need four more that's twenty percent I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| if you need five more now I'm into the pervious and I don't know how much the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| pervious adds to that there's got to be some I'd like to know if you can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| out and part of what you come back with is to give us an idea of what that cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| looks like what I don't know what adding thirty percent more parking spaces in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| pervious material with that what that adds to the cost of the development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| I've asked our engineering department for that and they're pulling together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| some information I've also looked on the web like everyone else first answer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| to Google it and the answer the pervious what I found was porous asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| and I'm trying to remember was about depending on which expert I relied upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| was from 20 to as much as 20 to 25 percent more than standard asphalt but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| it's cheaper than than concrete and I'll continue to do more research because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| prices were pretty varied I'll do more research and get with the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| department what I've seen is that it's the drainage underneath that that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| where the expense is and when we start talking about renovating buildings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| you're adding that on that's not always easy to attain that so I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| whereas it may be the best may be the solution for you to add more parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| spaces it may not always be the easiest to add that underground that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| drainage underneath it so I think you got to keep that in mind and I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| you know it's 20% the right number is it 30% I mean I think there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| enough leeway where it's fair and not where you're getting trapped but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| those are my comments look at that that number keep in mind the stormwater that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| you address through pervious surface you don't have to address if it's impervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| running off thank you thank you vice mayor grave I'd like to move that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| send this back to NPC second okay we have a motion and a second all in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| say aye aye any opposed the ayes have it and so ordered 12d is an ordinance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| amend the Knox City Code appendix B zoning regulations article 4 section 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| to clarify certain provisions of the South Waterfront District move for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| approval yeah maybe Bill Lyons or someone from the staff can address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| domino but the comments I've seen are the comments I've seen against this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| I really have no basis to criticize it but but the comments I've seen against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| this are that it's more than housekeeping and some significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| provisions have been taken out and I really don't know how to evaluate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| if someone could educate us as to what we're doing here sure help Peter Aaron's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| director of plans review and inspections if you look at this the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| changes on their own you could come away thinking that but if you look at it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| the context of all the ordinances within the city a lot of what's being taken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| of the South Waterfront is redundant like the stormwater things they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| covered some other ordinance or regulation the stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| here in talking with engineering staff this morning they said it appears that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| they were established to try and mimic a previous stormwater ordinance and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| current stormwater and street ordinance is actually more restrictive so better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| to refer to you right okay so that's really what you're talking about you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| streamlining this but we have other measures in place to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| significant exactly well in areas that are confusing to not only developers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| landowners we try to provide clarity in those areas as well we worked with three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| to the office of redevelopment office of sustainability engineering and plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| review and inspections thank you that was my guess but I thought well maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| maybe I'm way off base I appreciate the thank you okay any other discussion we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2096)|

| 0:38:09| the MPC staff at that particular meeting we had two residents George Wilson 45 44| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2289)|

| 0:38:36| opposed to this is was very well delineated by the MPC staff they talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2316)|
| 0:38:45| about Linesview is a combined area there's some offices commercial but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2325)|
| 0:38:56| all stops at a very good break point at colony way recently there have been two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| requests for office in that area and they were both denied so the history has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| been to retain this as residents for a long time it is the scenic highway and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2349)|
| 0:39:20| that certainly plays into it I think the recommendations from the staff also are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2360)|
| 0:39:29| discussing the amendment to the one-year plan and amendment to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2369)|
| 0:39:37| and this shows that this is the way it's been for a long time it shows that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| is what they think is appropriate in this case when they talked about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| the staff recommended they talked about the denial of it being spot zoning which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| it very much would be it is a natural break at Lindsay place and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| needs to be retained without question the question becomes if you allow it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| this piece of property what becomes the next one it's the old domino theory and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| we certainly know how that that works in reviewing the comments from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| they close with this the pattern currently is appropriate approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| office use for this site would only be unwarranted spot sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| and that refers to zoning and also to the change of the one-year plan generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2440)|
| 0:40:49| when you have a sector plan when there's an amendment for it there usually has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| be some type of a change that warrants the change otherwise what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| with the traffic what's happened with the school zones what's happened with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| the city deciding that maybe they want to make this a development well they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| note in here very specifically that none of these changes have existed so it begs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| to differ the question why we ask your consideration and we hope that you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2480)|

| 0:42:08| the existing building and that's the the what NPC approved was a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2528)|

| 0:43:10| been there for you know 60 plus years we're just we think the buildings cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| and we intend to be good stewards of the property so and and for the record a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2597)|
| 0:43:27| church is allowed both in the current zone the r2 and the o1 zone that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| switching to or that we're hoping to switch it to so and and I did request a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| meeting with the Sequoia Hills Homeowners Association they they offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| to have one the morning of the MPC hearing but it was kind of at the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| minute and so anyway thank you all right thank you sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| vice mayor grave Thank You mayor Gerald the MPC staff denied this correct and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2636)|
| 0:44:06| would you sort of give a summary of why and is this spot zoning the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| recommended denial of this and as I pointed out the Commission recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| approval of two conditions the I think mr. Blattner did a good job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| identifying the staff's concerns they were addressed and stated in the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| report the fact that this was a break in the zoning patent would be a break in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| the zoning pattern that exists along lines view pipe the fact that the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| that could be made in reviewing this staff looked at the broad office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| category and the uses that could be made in that because if it were rezoned as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| requested with no conditions any use permitted in the office zone could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| made of this property and we looked at it from that context feeling of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| that array of uses would not be compatible with the proposed with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| existing uses in the area and looking at it the it does appear to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| characteristics of spot zoning and that it would provide the owner of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| property with the uses and the potentials that did not exist or were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| not not be present for the neighboring property owners as pointed out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| staff report the access to the only other office district in the area is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| from lines view Pike it's from old Kingston Pike so this would open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| access to uses that that would not normally be accessing properties in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| area the Planning Commission tried to to address some of these concerns with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| their conditions that it be used on review and that the existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| be used thank you councilman de la Valle thank you mayor I guess I'm a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| confused I understand the arguments on both sides I didn't see where this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| even in Sequoia and I didn't understand why Sequoia was getting sort of worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| up about it but it's not the Kingston Pike piece we took off the agenda but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| I read this this half acre or a little less than half acre it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| subject to a use on review condition and at the existing building stay intact so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| and they're talking about a usage and I realize we're talking zoning and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| just one man's use but they're talking about a usage of half dozen cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| how is there really impact on the community or is it just we're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| zones and that's a bad thing if you're addressing that to me I'll be yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| why don't you take okay first first of all the boundaries of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| Sequoia Hills Association goes along lines view does it okay yes it has for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| 40 years so it is well within our boundaries and it is an extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| the scenic highway on Kingston Pike down there so all of it all of it makes a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| of sense I think I think the main concern is first of all I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| personally believe that spot zoning is appropriate in very many cases I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| the fact that there has been two requests for office in that area already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| I have been denied recently I think one in oh two and one or no five shows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| there is some validity of the domino theory and that once you let your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| boundaries slide then you are in a much tougher position to defend when the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2861)|
| 0:47:49| one comes up otherwise if somebody wants to put one right next to it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| it's tough to say well okay sure it's our but on this side it's oh and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| just an extension of what we've done in the oh so I think there is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| concern of that thank you as far as the traffic is concerned I think there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| little or no impact I would agree with that thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| councilman Wallace yes ma'am let's hear back from mr. Greenwood so what so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2898)|
| 0:48:28| building's been unimproved for quite a while right I mean it's sitting there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| a church not much used being closed off right it's been got a gate on gate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| Midland Avenue and access off Midland and an access off lines view for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| part I've seen that that's been closed off for quite a while so you're always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| gonna make it are you gonna use the access on to lines of you pine well we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| would yes but my my partners and I we there's five of us essentially that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| would be occupying the office and or the building and we the majority of our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| is outside the area we don't host many meetings so I don't I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| there's any kind of appreciable use you know from our standpoint we would I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| if we were to invite real I mean real estate so an architect or an engineer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| a prospect or somebody to come we'd certainly want them to be able to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| know turn off of lines view into the building but but most likely that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| gonna access out the back more than but you have to improve the access improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| the look from the outside I mean it's it's a half acre lot so there's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| lot you can and it's yeah and we're right now it goes it goes side to side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| right right and we're and it's it's it's relatively narrow I mean from a from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| functional standpoint you know I think when you look at spot zoning that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| is kind of the perfect situation for that because you've got it you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| building that the you know the the membership is dwindled the the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| who kind of run it it's it's really a group of sisters and they're in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| 80s and the there is you know the building is unique I think it has a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3005)|
| 0:50:13| of character and it's not functional for a an r2 type you couldn't cut it up into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| something that would be utilized for you know multifamily residential and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| the property back off of Midland is zone office yes it is yeah so it's and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3027)|

| 1:04:10| administrative approval by MPC staff that meets the intent of the beard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| village opportunities plan I know that you can put conditions on them at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| meeting and I would suggest that we do that and I think that gets me over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| process feelings that those of us on the council have I don't think it inhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| him in any way from complying and moving forward on that we certainly don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| to do that but he said at that meeting that he was agreeable to to trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3885)|
| 1:05:00| meet the intent of the beard and village plan and it is in the minutes from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| happy to get input and to try to meet the intent of the beard and village plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| so that's what I would ask that you adopt this condition which will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| inhibit him in any way but will allow him to move forward and to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| process back in order so that the MPC staff has a review to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| do that in my opinion if we don't do that and in essence what we're doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| we're throwing away that plan it was passed by MPC it was passed by City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| Council and I think that it does need the consideration and this is one way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| make that work and not inhibit anything thank you thank you mr. Blattner advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3948)|
| 1:05:56| may agree yes in fact I arranged for the meeting with Peter Hall and with Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| Blattner and Sandy Gillespie and we did meet at his office building down in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Homburg and like Jim was saying if y'all get a chance to see the building it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| obvious that he does good work they're most concerned then in fact they used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| own the apartment complex that was next door and some of us on council may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| remember that we rezone that piece of property for them to have parking they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| have since sold the apartment building and it kept the kept a lot he pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| well it's obvious in terms of the quality of work that he does that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| it's going to be nice whatever he does but I do think there is a concern in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| terms of putting some kind of condition on the on this that he does follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| Bearden plan he did talk about landscaping and sidewalks and this sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| of thing in terms of what he wants to do part of the problem and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Jim addresses is that he's not sure yet what he's going to do with it he knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| he's going to develop it it may be an office building it may be a gift shop of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| some kind and I personally am convinced that whatever he does it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| nice but it is still kind of up in the air and I think that I do understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| concern that the folks have over the fact that a process wasn't followed so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| we might want to consider adding a condition to that yeah thank you mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| Joe Green is this going to come as a use on review before you anyway the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| trying to think of the uses on review and the c1 I know restaurant is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| that's I believe about it in the sequence depends on what he chooses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| depends on what he chooses in all likelihood the development would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| come back to MPC as a use on review would you be comfortable with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| condition that said that it be subject to a use on review that requires the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| developer to show that he meets the intent of the village plan we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| comfortable with that I'll make a motion that we amended to do that to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| with a use on review that allows it MPC to look and see if it complies with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| intent and that's what it says in the minutes the intent of the bill I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| second that it's mr. Hall here mr. Peter Hall okay okay so we have an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4092)|
| 1:08:21| and you have that well everybody understands the amendment Wallace so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| Charles is that a can we can we make that motion at this level without it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| being heard by MPC hello you've been on council now that's what I thought I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4110)|
| 1:08:41| had the same issue with conditional zoning ever since all of you came on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| council I've never seen a Supreme Court case from the state of Tennessee yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| that upholds conditional zoning I've heard I've seen a case that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| conditional zoning is permitted in the state of Tennessee but conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| zoning really had nothing to do with that case and so it was just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| the court threw in there and I haven't seen it in any other case so whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| whether that would be upheld by the court or not I really cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| definitively tell you that I can say that we have added conditions to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| on multiple occasions and in other instances and so if you if you add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| condition to the zoning then I can't assure you that it would be upheld if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| were challenged legally but take a shot at it we just had one your chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| establish the rule without him here I'd be more comfortable postpone it let him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| come speak to it if he's in favor of it then it's a me point I mean he needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| know what he's agreeing to and what so you're placing it so unlike the El| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| Charro that's three properties over which we didn't apply right and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| didn't we did not make them move their building closer to the street we gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| them a waiver well Gerald can I mean how do you address the other conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| that were applied how do you address that how do we make this one different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| than that Gerald try not to give a short answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4217)|
| 1:10:26| essentially by placing that condition on it again the intent of the Bearden plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| gives us a bit broader perspective than saying it has to comply 100% with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| Bearden plan when I think of the intent of the Bearden plan it's a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| that would be more pedestrian friendly the architecture would be more in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| keeping with the predominant and if there is a predominant architecture and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| in the Bearden village those are the primary things in the pedestrian field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| could be met by having landscaping along the street a sidewalk connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| from the street to the main entrance of the building a little less dominance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| the parking area so that the parking is to the side of the building instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| the front the main feature of the building is not the mechanical equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| like it is with El Charro I think there are a number of things we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| would meet the intent and work with the with Mr. Hall and I know I'm not to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| I'm not an attorney by any means but I know in reading about conditional zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| that if the applicant agrees to it that's negotiated zoning and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| consider contract zoning and that's not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| we're not allowed to do contract zoning I know so how does adding this as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| amendment how does that change what's already out there that's already subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| to the Bearden plan nothing is subject to the Bearden plan now the Bearden plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| is totally a policy document it has never been codified as an ordinance so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| there are no provisions of the Bearden plan that have been incorporated into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| the ordinance for that area or for the city as a whole the city zoning as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| whole applies to the Bearden area so C1 standards and Fountain City are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| as the C1 standards in Bearden again I think I mean not without him being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| to speak to it I mean I think he's do the right to at least talk about it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| I wouldn't move we postpone it for two weeks a lot of him Mr. Hall to come speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| to it there would be a second reading and then a visit to MPC wouldn't I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I think we're not asking it to go back to MPC right right now maybe yeah well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4364)|
| 1:12:52| you can do the second reading but that's what you want because mr. Blattner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| here I'm gonna give him a chance to say okay mr. mr. fellow they brought up my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| point there's there is a second reading for rezoning so certainly we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| glad to contact mr. Hall and inform him of what's been done and if you decide if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| he was totally objectionable to it at that second reading you could take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| off and move forward plus Charles could take it to the Ninth Circuit which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| much more liberal but you got me and how to get it to the Ninth Circuit so again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| I'll renew the motion that we that we approve it subject the condition that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| be sent for use on review by the MPC to see that it is what it is meets the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4417)|
| 1:13:47| intent of the Bearden that's the intent was the word and not some strict letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| of rules because what mr. Blattner read from the MPC minutes number one tells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4432)|
| 1:14:04| you that has been considered by MPC right so it wouldn't have to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| MPC the second thing is probably the proper motion is exactly the way mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| Brousseau stated it which is prior to the issuance of building permits for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| development of the subject property the applicant must submit a plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4459)|

| 1:14:29| Association that meets the intent of the Bearden village opportunities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| building permits issued must be consistent with that approved plan second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| that's the third we the Bearden Council is confident enough in the NPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4479)|
| 1:14:59| that it will comply with the intent we don't have to be considered in there if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| you want to strike us we would we would be okay with that if not we'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| forward let's let's go ahead and strike it and okay we will strike that the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4511)|

| 1:16:49| just want to start out saying thank you for the work you do for the city I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| realize that some of the time this involves making big decisions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| Knoxville about the budget or the direction of the city I also realize at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| the work you do involves numerous smaller tasks so I was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| this earlier and I thought even if you just got one thing done a week each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| you just got one thing done a week and which I know it's way more than that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| would be like 5,000 5,000 things a year you could check off the list of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| done here but that seemed that seems like a lot but and I'm sure the figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| is actually much much more than that and my impression is that you genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| care about the people of Knoxville too I just want to want to see things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| fairly just as we saw so so as we look forward to the fall it might be easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4666)|
| 1:17:59| feel some anxiety about new leaders coming on to the council it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| easy to wonder what might happen to the legacy of this particular council but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4686)|
| 1:18:14| it's my opinion that you can be free from anxiety free of anxiety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| continue to lead the city well and I know I know from my own experience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| success and maybe we can relate on this is not not a great thing to find rest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| so even though successes you've had so far not always a great thing to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| rest in because in the midst of success people still complain we doubt if we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4717)|
| 1:18:46| actually been successful I may be wrongly I would doubt that but and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| also just plain burnout we can burn out get worn out what's gonna motivate us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| continue and what what does it mean to continue what do we continue towards as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| we think about this so that it's at this point that I have to remind myself that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| maybe there's something more going on in life and just the material stuff we deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| with day in day out maybe there's a source of rest maybe there's a source of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| rest beyond recounting what we've accomplished or lamenting what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| not accomplished and I'm probably not the only one who feels like sometimes no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4774)|
| 1:19:43| matter how hard we work we won't get everything done that we wanted to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| done so can the question then is can we be at peace can we be at peace we be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| okay in the middle of that as we as we feel that tension of having desire to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| do things but not not being able to get everything done and I think that at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| end of the day I think at the end of the day God is the only one who can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| us with satisfying rest and peace do I know everything there is to know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| this no but I do experience satisfaction in trusting and leaning on him whether I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| succeed or fail and that's at this point it's at this point I think we can let go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| of anxiety and frustration you have one minute sir thank you we can let go of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170214?start=4834)|
