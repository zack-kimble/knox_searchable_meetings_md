| 0:06:04| each may speak for or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=364)|

| 0:07:52| in this room but all over our city, knew Cameron from his political engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| But the time that I've had to spend with Cameron, I believe that his commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=479)|

| 0:11:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I've attended one subcommittee, audit subcommittee meeting just to kind of get an idea of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I asked a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| And the composition of the committee, I'm assuming, Warren, maybe you can explain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| little bit more to it about the composition, the way it is now and what you're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| as far as more citizen input on the subcommittee and the auditing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| So to just my comment about internal auditing process, the city does need to have more onboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=748)|
| 0:12:40| auditors, in-house auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| So however that could be accomplished, it needs to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| When you do the external audits and you call in the consultants and everything, it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| better to have people that know the city and know what goes on in the city in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| get a true understanding of what is and isn't getting accomplished with the people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=779)|
| 0:13:09| That concludes the people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Yeah, just to respond to the question that was raised and for clarification, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| And this is an amendment to our existing ordinance on the Audit Committee about the make-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| the composition of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| This would add, and it would put us in line with other cities across the state that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| similar to us in size and make-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| And it would put not just council members, but people who are experts in the field of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| accounting and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| The Audit Committee oversees and interacts with the external auditors, which is a required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| We do, the city contracts out for an external audit every year that's required by state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| law and is turned in to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| But then also we are looking at doing internal risk assessments and audits in line with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| other cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| So this amendment for composition, just to get people on the committee, that is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| practice, I think I said this at the last meeting, in keeping with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| from MTAS and what other cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So that's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=863)|

| 0:17:07| You know, Councilmembers, this is sort of like a BZA appeal, so he'll hear first from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| the people, three people who signed up, oh, three people in favor, three people against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| and then you guys can discuss and make a motion and ask any further questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| So Mr. Marlow, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| Do you wish to speak in favor of your item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| I don't believe I signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| It sounds like there's a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Are there more than three in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| In favor, one, two, who's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1065)|
| 0:17:58| Okay, there are three people who signed up to speak in favor, so you don't want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| among them, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| I'll let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| You can have the rebuttal, since it's, you know, all right, so we'll do the three in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| The first person signed up to speak in favor of item 10A is Tyler Givens, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1098)|
| 0:18:28| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Yeah, Mr. Johnson's going to need a lozenge and a water before this night's over, reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| all these tongue twisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| So there are lots of these amendments and proposals with zoning changes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| My understanding is that this one is to amend language regarding two family dwellings, multi-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| accessory dwellings, small lots of records, amend setbacks, interior and side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| So this ordinance would allow people in residential zones across the city to add additional bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| and dwelling units to their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| The changes would directly benefit lower income folks and homeowners who have been previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| excluded due to lot sizes who might need an extra room for a young adult living at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| home or for an elderly family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| This proposal is less limiting than what Opticos and the mayor are promoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| The administration wants less market freedom and more restrictions on housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| The administration concedes that we need lower income, higher density housing, but wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| to maintain control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| The mayor wants to maintain a veto power over development via special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| We can't let multiplexes invade West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Let's not have any more duplexes in Forth and Gill, just the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Looking at the areas identified by Opticos reminds me of a story of Boxtown, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| A proposed 49-mile oil pipeline project would have cut through black neighborhoods in southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Memphis and crossed over the city's drinking water source in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| An oil company spokesperson described this route as the point of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Magnolia from Broadway to Rutledge, Alice Bell, East Knoxville, Morningside, Inskip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and Fountain City, nothing outside the 640 loop, that's the point of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| As we densify because we must, the rules should be the same for every similarly zoned neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| The administration should not have a thumb on the scale to keep density out of the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The city should encourage the well-recognized urban design practice of mixing income residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Packing more density into low-income areas is ghettoization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| It is the modern urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| As we grow, as we densify, we should not entrench inequalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Every area should bear some of the burden and every area should gain some of the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| I yield the remainder of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Okay, the next person signed up to speak in favor of 10A is Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| Mr. Durham, please start by saying your name and address for the record and you have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Yeah, so my name is Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| My address is 1422 Cornelia Street, zip code is 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| All right, yeah, so I, bear with me, I don't have pre-made remarks so I'm shooting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| the hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| In general, I did just want to speak, not just as a citizen, but as someone who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| been lucky enough to serve as a commissioner on the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| So I've got to, you know, help us get our new bus system that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| I've gotten to work with a lot of great people, including Councilman Smith, and I'm very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| of what we've done with the new bus routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| We are going to be able to provide a lot of people in our city a lot better bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| We're about to have four lines that come every 15 minutes, you know, not quite European standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| but considering that a lot of our lines previously came once an hour, and as someone who used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| to have to rely on transit because of multiple car issues, I can tell you that frequency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| can make or break a transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Why did I bring that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Because there have obviously been, you know, concerns any time there is a change, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| have concerns with that change, and there have been concerns about certain, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| portions of lines being removed or certain portions of the city not being served as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| And the elephant in the room is just, frankly, that the way our city has been built and designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| does not allow for adequate transit because of our land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| When you allow 75, 80 percent of an incorporated area to be just single family homes, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| not provide the density needed for transit, for walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| In my personal experience, it also allows for less freedom, especially financial freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| I am what you would call someone who is living a car-lite life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| I use a car, you know, once every two weeks to get groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Every other day I can walk or bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| And so that's why I am in support of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| I also am in support of what the city is doing through Optico, so I think that is the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| direction and I applaud the city for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| However, I do think that we can go further and we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| My biggest concern with what the city is doing compared to this amendment is that while it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| is good to reform many of our currently walkable neighborhoods, again, the reality is most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| land in our city is zoned R and 1, and if we want to have transit, again speaking from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| a transit perspective, that would best serve everyone, we need to start viewing our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| and our neighborhoods not as a museum, but as a living organism, something that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| to respond to current demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Overwhelmingly, I think it's 70 or so percent of my generation, millennials, are very okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| not only living in this missing middle housing, but living around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| I believe now over a majority of baby boomers are in favor of it as well as they age and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| they want that freedom to walk where they want to go to, you know, restaurants and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| And so, again, I do applaud the city for what you all are doing with this, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| that as we move forward, we need to have a critical look at ways we can take this even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| further, especially because as a transit commissioner, my worry is that we would be operating in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| silos and we do not understand that land use does directly affect transit and that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| redo this bus system, but do not look critically at how most of the land in our city is used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| our transit system will not be the best it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| And so for that, I am in favor of what the city is doing, but I view this as a yes and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| like yes, I agree with what the city is doing and let's see if we can take it a bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| Because I think that'll make not just our transit system better, but I think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| make Knoxville more affordable and I think it will protect our neighborhood character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| of being a place where you can raise a family and save money and not have to spend every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| excess dollar you have on a mortgage or rent because we've provided that additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| So yes, thank you for what you're doing, but also let's take it even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1521)|

| 0:26:43| What's being presented to you comes disguised as affordable housing advocacy, but we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1603)|

| 0:26:53| Mr. Marlowe has proposed euthanizing our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Mr. Marlowe has referred to people needing a meal as vermin feeding at the trough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| These are not the words of an affordable housing advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| These are the words of a housing profiteer, a man that's just trying to raise his margins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| by lowering his costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I am an affordable housing advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I was raised in a one-bedroom apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| I slept in the top bunk while my mother slept in the bottom bunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And she moved us into that apartment so I could go to the best school in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| And from there, we moved into a fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| And from there, we moved into a condo that shared walls with 31 other units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| And I am eternally grateful for that opportunity because it allowed me to grow up in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and a school system that was racially and economically diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| And that has paid so many dividends to me as I moved across the country and I went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| the college life and I went into my professional life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| And that's what I want for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| I live in potentially the most expensive neighborhood in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| And I want there to be more affordable housing opportunities in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| I want my kids to have the same opportunity to grow up and have the opportunities I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1701)|
| 0:28:29| so that they can become more fuller, more empathetic human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And we have the beginnings of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| At the center of Sequoia Hills, we have a pretty vibrant apartment community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| A house on my block has been chopped up into five different apartments and that's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| But that's not what Mr. Marlowe is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| What Mr. Marlowe is proposing is an opportunity for real estate investors and developers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| double dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| They can buy up properties, rent them out, and then put another property on top of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| or right beside it and rent that out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Essentially, he's trying to double his income without doubling his costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| And planning staff correctly pointed out what this does to a neighborhood is overburden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| its utility system that's already struggling, it interferes with stormwater drainage, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| it absolutely contradicts several vectors of our existing zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1772)|
| 0:29:40| Mr. Marlowe's requests are not about affordable housing, they're about raising his profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| I urge you to reject 10A, 10B, 10C, and certainly 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| And while I don't think the mayor's current missing middle housing proposal is perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| by any means, I don't think it's aggressive enough, it is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| I applaud the administration for such an aggressive timeline and I encourage you to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| month to hear her proposal and then hear how the community reacts to her proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Because I guarantee you, 99.99% of this city has no idea what Mr. Marlowe is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1826)|

| 0:31:05| We were very heavily involved with the three year public process for recode, the rewriting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| of the entire Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| We submitted over 150 pages of analysis and comments regarding many issues and attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| and participated in many meetings and workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| We have also been involved with many amendments to the zoning ordinance since it went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| effect in January 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| We speak out on issues of interest and concerns to neighborhoods and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| We particularly feel strongly about protecting the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1898)|

| 0:31:47| Amending the Knoxville zoning ordinance affects all property owners either directly or indirectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| It is imperative that any proposed zoning ordinance amendments receive careful consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| with input from the public and neighborhood associations and through a transparent process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| with adequate notice and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| The zoning ordinance is a complicated document and at times it is appropriate to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| However, one must analyze proposed amendments in one section to see if those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| will conflict with other sections of the zoning ordinance or have unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| and to investigate whether they will have a negative impact on adjacent or nearby property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| owners and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1952)|

| 0:32:56| The city has initiated a comprehensive public process to consider proposed amendments related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| to missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=1982)|

| 0:35:18| I was denied that the first go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2118)|

| 0:35:47| my proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| And I think if it's sent back now, it will probably be heard at the October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| I think, maybe, which is the same time that I believe the administration's, and this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2156)|

| 0:36:12| and I think together we could get to a broader and better amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Yeah, I'd like to call on Mr. Frost for some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| So we have an appeal here, we're not approving changes to the code, we're approving, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| being tasked with approving the appeal, which is to send it back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| or denying the appeal, which is to uphold the decision of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Well, thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Mr. Marlowe laid out the situation, Planning Commission did not consider either 10A, 10B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2209)|
| 0:36:59| or 10C on the merits, or the substance, and Director Brooks can please correct me if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| They put them off, waiting for, I guess, the consultant to finish their work and work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| the city on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| So what Mr. Marlowe is asking, and he can correct me if I'm wrong, is if you uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| Mr. Marlowe's appeal on 10A, 10B, and 10C, you're asking Planning Commission to get right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| on it, to look at it, to make a recommendation and place it on the Planning Commission agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| for review and for consideration on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| If you deny Mr. Marlowe's appeal, you are saying you're in agreement with the actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2261)|
| 0:37:50| of the Planning Commission, was this August 10th, and that is to allow the city consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| and the administration to come up with their proposals so they can be considered simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| Mr. Marlowe, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| I don't think my proposals will be considered at all if this appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| Well, if your appeal is upheld, don't you agree that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| If my appeal was upheld, if they sent it back to Planning Commission, then I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| they would be reviewing both proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Respectfully, I don't know what, if your appeal is denied, what's going to happen, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| I mean, maybe this is for Director Brooks to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| If it's sent back to Planning Commission, Amy Brooks, Knox-Mox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| If Mr. Marlowe's appeal, appeals, plural, are denied, what would then be the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| of the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| The Planning Commission, on their October agenda, will be considering the administration's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| proposal to incorporate missing middle housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| So you would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| There's still an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Mayor Kincannon indicated there's two open houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| There's also a council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| So additional input will be part of that process leading up to Planning Commission's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| of that draft proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| And Council Member Ryder, of course, you know, council will have its opportunity to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| their thoughts through amendment or through the input that we all hear through these upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| meetings and the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| So there's a lot more opportunity for members of the community and elected officials who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| represent the community to consider the proposal I've, you know, we've put together and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| other elements, including elements that Mr. Marlowe has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| Mr. Frost, also, could I ask that you answer Mr. Roach's question when he spoke to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Well, I believe if Mr. Marlowe's appeals are approved, that Planning Commission will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| then consider them on their merits and place them on a Planning Commission agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| Is that correct, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| It is correct that they will come back before Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I would like to note that in the packet, there was an analysis done by planning staff as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| well as City of Knoxville staff of the amendments as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| Just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Okay, I'll defer to my colleagues for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Since I think the main thing we've got to do right now is just understand the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| So my understanding from Mr. Frost's comments just a moment ago are that planning did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2450)|
| 0:40:59| review this on the merits and that if we deny it, then these proposals don't get seen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2459)|
| 0:41:10| at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And if we send it back to planning, then they would get reviewed when the city's plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Is that correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I believe so, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| So we haven't heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| This hasn't been heard on the merits, these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| I think they should be heard on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| I think what we need to make sure of, which, you know, the folks that were up here going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| through the recode process remember very vividly, was the, you know, transparent public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| that we went through, which often kept us in very long meetings, you know, very late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| into the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| So we definitely need to make sure that that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| So I would make a motion to send this back to planning commission for them to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| these along with the city's plans at the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And I think that's a good way to have all of this looked at at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| I do think that what I have seen, and I'm looking forward to our workshop later this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| month on the city's approach, is a much more engaged process and something where we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2542)|
| 0:42:32| to make sure that we're continuing to engage the public and making sure they have notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| of what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| So I'll make a motion to send it back, send item 10A back to planning to consider in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2559)|
| 0:42:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I'm sorry, could you say the last part of that motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| To their October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Did your motion include that it be considered in conjunction with the Opticus recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| or that it gets heard in the October meeting regardless of whether the Opticus proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| I think it should be considered during the discussion with the planning commission at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| that meeting in October as long as that's when it's coming to planning, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Then I want to make sure I understand the motion because I think your intended motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| is that council consider these proposed amendments as well as Opticus proposed amendments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| that they be considered simultaneously whether that occurs in October or whenever it occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| depending on how it gets scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| What I'm proposing is that planning review all of these in their October meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| then send to council what they want to, not that it has to come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Let's have the motions on the floor and it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| So now council can discuss this motion to put it back to planning commission so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| on the planning commission's agenda exactly the way it was before, but just at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| time as the agenda where my proposal's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| And that's exactly right and my preference for when it does go back to planning is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2669)|
| 0:44:38| planning look very seriously at what the city's proposal is because I think that's a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| solution for us to be reviewing, but I do think that this wasn't considered on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| It's in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| We'll send it back to be seen in October along with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| I have just a little legal issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Because I think it is appropriate and it's a fair motion to make a motion that it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| remanded to the planning commission to consider these and I think you in that motion can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| suggest that it be placed on the same agenda with the city's proposals regarding these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| same issues, but I don't think it's within the appropriate power of this body to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2726)|
| 0:45:35| the agenda for the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| So I think they will follow your suggestion if you suggest that it be considered at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| same time as the city's, but rather than say it is going to be required to do that, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| that oversteps your powers just a little bit and so if you would amend your motion to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| that you move that it be remanded to planning with the suggestion that it be included on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| the same agenda as the city's proposals on middle housing, then I think you'd be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| I will amend my motion to remand this back to planning for their October meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| the suggestion that they consider all of these proposals at the time that the cities are presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Okay, so this is for the motion that I think that you retracted, you're just amending your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2789)|
| 0:46:38| own motion, so it's a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| And the city recorder has asked, is that motion just with regard to appeal number A or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| it with regard to all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I think it should go to all three and so to save us some time, I'll just make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Can we do A, B, and C all at once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Okay, council members, so you want to try to do this amendment for A, B, and C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| You probably should suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Yeah, you all want to vote to suspend your rules to do it on A, B, and C all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| knowing that there are people signed up to speak on A, B, and C as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| I think each of these items, we're going to hear very similar issues, so I think devoting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| These does not end these appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| They will be considered again on the merits and all of this will go back to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| so I think that's a fair way of going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I don't have a problem with having A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Is there a motion to suspend the rules so this motion could be for items 10A, B, and C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Motion to suspend the rules for A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Okay, motion has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Now we're back to Vice Mayor Roberto's voting on the suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2888)|
| 0:48:16| All those in favor of suspending the rules to allow this motion to be the same for item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| 10A, B, and C, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Okay, the rules have been suspended for this instance, and now we're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| I'm not sure who had their light on first, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| Okay, so we're still in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| We're talking about the motion, which is, you know, to send it back to planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| to consider at the same time as they consider my administration's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| Okay, well, I just had general comments on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| That's germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Yeah, so I just wanted to say, you know, I see someone here striving to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| First, is finding a way to simplify a very complex and sometimes broken system to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2943)|
| 0:49:12| make doing business in the city easier and more desirable, and secondly, address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| lack of missing middle housing that we have discussed ad nauseum and given a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| of lip service to during these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| I do get frustrated continuing to hear that developers are pushing their own agendas for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| self-enrichment, and I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| There are a lot of developers here that are dedicated to addressing the housing problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| and my question to those people is, who do you propose is going to be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| building said housing if we're ever going to create a path forward and generate some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| real solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| We're in a very different time from RECODE with a whole new housing landscape and crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| from 2019, and RECODE was always intended to be a living document, and we have to evolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| and resolve new and pressing issues as our city evolves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| I am not saying that all that's being proposed in Mr. Marlowe's amendments is perfect or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| even the most viable recommendations, but a lot of it gets in the weeds, though that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| not necessarily a bad thing, but these amendments are complicated with a lot of details, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| they do raise some legit concerns to be considered, but I do feel there's someone who, genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| a concerned citizen, has expertise in this space, has invested a great deal to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| some real and actionable items, deserves to have a productive and constructive analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| of this proposal with thorough feedback on why a proposed amendment is or is not conducive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| to the overall objective, and there are provisions for a reason that allow for due process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3052)|
| 0:51:01| review of any ordinance changes, ideas, suggestions that members of the general public bring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| the table and pay substantial dollars for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| As we've heard and we know, the administration is bringing their own recommendations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| that also include good ideas, and we'll be discussing through the workshop, through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| public input sessions over the coming weeks, but we talk a lot about public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| We talk a lot about neighborhood advocacy and transparency, and I would presume we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| at least consider comments from all those sessions, so I'm not sure how or why these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| proposed amendments are any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| They've just shown up in a different format in the way of ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| So for that reason, and I'm pleased we're moving in that direction to see Mr. Marlowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| proposed ordinance amendments go back to Planning Commission alongside the administration's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| proposal and see if we can't, there can't be a collaboration of ideas and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| to complement and strengthen the OPTICOS proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| I'm not sure why this is an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Both are aimed at accomplishing the same goal of more missing middle housing, and both were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| crafted as a result of the OPTICOS consultation, but I'm a believer that we can find more alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| between the two and work together to leverage the best possible outcome between these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| I don't want to have the OPTICOS recommendations are helped inform our proposal, but it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| has the input from our engineers and plans reviews and inspections and also many members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| of planning staff, including Director Brooks and Lindsey Crockett, who are sitting at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| So it's informed and, you know, has the expertise of that outside entity, but it also is unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| to Knoxville and serves our needs and just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| I should say OPTICOS inspired, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Council Member Parker and then Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| I have a procedural question, but along the same lines of what everyone else has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| it makes most sense to me that these discussions about Mr. Marlowe's proposals happen at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| same time as we're anticipating more proposals coming from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| And so procedural question is, I would like for us to defer this to our workshop at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3218)|
| 0:53:49| end of the month as well as sending it back to planning procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| Procedurally, you would not need to include that in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| If you as a council, council runs its own workshops, so it's up to council to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| whether they want to have a workshop while it's going forward and planning at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So you would not need to add that to the motion procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| You just have to convince your colleagues to add it to a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Well, I'll use this second to just encourage us to be open to listening to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3261)|
| 0:54:30| And I also don't know if there's an amendment that's needed on the original motion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| to ensure clarity moving forward, there have been some changes and amendments to what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| even before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| And it should be the most updated proposal from Mr. Marlowe that goes back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| So if that's what's before us, then that's what goes back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| But if there have been, you know, if that doesn't include what we just got today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| What you got today is the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Mr. Marlowe, you can't speak unless you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Please, Mayor, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Well, we're just listening to the law directors who actually know about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| So Mr. Law Director, could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So if Mr. Marlowe wants to make amendments to his proposals that he thinks makes them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| better, certainly when it goes back to planning, he can offer those amendments at that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Does not need to do it here because you're not going to consider them on their merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| I do want to address Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Mr. Marlowe, did I hear you say correctly earlier in this conversation that you felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| like you were not given due process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Could you expound on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| It was, I believe, the plain language of the ordinance that allows a citizen to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| a zoning amendment implies that the Planning Commission will judge the merits of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3360)|
| 0:56:10| And I do not believe that staff's recommendation touched any of the merits of my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| They merely suggested a policy move without talking about my amendments, whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| agreed or disagreed or wanted to modify them at all in reference to 10-A, 10-B, 10-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3383)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I also want to address someone said earlier, which I agree with, is that we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| things as it relates to the zoning, that there are people who are living in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| and communities, residents and homeowners, who have no clue about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| And so I do think giving it more time for people to become aware of it and to give feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| is critical as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| Because again, while RECODE is a living and breathing document, these are decisions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| people will have to live with for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| And it will affect their communities and the demographic of their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And so I do think it's important that we gather that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| And so I'm in support of sending it back at this point based on those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| What I didn't want to happen tonight was for this to just get dropped and be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| So thank you, Vice Mayor, for continuing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I know there's a lot of work that will go into this before it comes back to us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| it may end up back at planning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| My concern is, have we thought about long-term, and I think this will come up at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| have we thought about long-term how to keep moving this forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| I think the administration's plan addresses a very small piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| It's a place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Maybe some of these will be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Maybe some of them will expand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| But then what do we do next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Are we talking about having a stakeholder group that, much like RECODE, got together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| and that's a way for the community to be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| In the email that Cheryl Ball sent you all last week, it contained information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| some upcoming community meetings, but also, and we didn't highlight this because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| just on the webpage, but I consider this phase one of future phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| We're starting with missing middle housing, and we're doing it informed by a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| more people from the community that we've heard from already, but more to come, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| also people from engineering, from plans, reviews, and inspection, from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Phase one, missing middle housing, this stuff, as we've all noted, is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| To try to do everything all at once might be unnecessarily complicated, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| we want to go in a sustainable manner with community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| That's what I'm saying, that we're doing little piece by little piece, but we have to keep on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| Like, I want every month something new to be coming to joining this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| This is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| So what is our ongoing process is what I'm looking at, maybe a stakeholder group so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| public can be involved, but I don't want this to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Ms. Ball, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| I know we're still, you know, we've been focusing on missing middle, but other phases are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| come and other, you know, how to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| We do intend to have, we have a list of a multitude of things that we can continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Pretty important to go through this community process that we intend to launch over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| next several weeks, that is going to largely inform the next steps that we take, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| as the conversation at this, from this body, as well as planning commission to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| understand the interest of our community, the interest of this body and that body to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| make sure that we're putting forward the best plans that make the most sense for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| The planning staff have been essential and involved in this process with us, helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| us develop this plan from the beginning, and their expertise has been invaluable, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| the expertise of our team and our OPTICOS folks have all been involved up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| So you're saying the public process, the two meetings that are coming up, will inform the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| next few steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Oh, most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I think that they will inform how we move forward with, they're probably not the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| They're probably not the only ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| My concern is that certain people come to meetings just like this, and so it's not representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| of the community altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| I mean, how many people here are renters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| I don't see that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I see one or two hands up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| So how are we going to get this out to here from people who are being evicted right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| than the people who are being most highly impacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| That's the group I really, we really need to include, and I know that it's a very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Well, Ms. Singh, I think that's an excellent point, and when we have these upcoming meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| one thing can be like, what is the best way to engage people beyond, in addition to, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| these community meetings, you know, more community meetings like that, a stakeholder group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| makes sure we have people who represent all segments of our population, you know, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| are things that we can consider and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| But I hope that we do that also while we consider some changes along the way, you know, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| So, you know, we're trying to address the urgency of this and not go so fast that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| know, people don't know what's going on, but not wait around until, you know, everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| not going to know what's going on because that's just the nature of land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| People don't usually, you know, pay close attention until it hits their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| So, but yeah, I think those are some great ideas, and maybe we can hear from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| at these upcoming meetings and at the workshop, and if a stakeholder group is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| makes sense, then certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| I think we should try more than just these two meetings, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| We need to somehow go into the community and get more input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Just three quick comments and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Mr. Marlow, thank you for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I don't agree with all the pieces in here, but your persistence over the past 12 to 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| months is admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| I think you've raised these, not just in the past month, you've raised these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| I've been copied on plenty of your emails, so I know that your voice, just like everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| else in the communities, needs to be heard, and I think there's been too slow a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| to a lot of these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I also want to say, as we kind of continue, or kind of really go into an extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| public phase of missing middle housing, I can only speak for myself, I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| urgency of the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| I've rented, I've owned everything in between, I've borrowed couches, and so I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| the urgency that some of you are facing, that many people in our community are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| I also meet with 10 neighborhood organizations just about every other month, and so what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| I also know is that people need time to hear things over and over and unpack what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| first gut reaction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Knowledge, education, people need to work through those because their first impulse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| may not be where they land, and so I do think, while there's some merit in these, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| public process is really important, and it requires extraordinary public process, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| just a couple meetings, I would agree with Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| So people need time to work through these things, and I think I will compliment city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| The website that's been put out is a good start of illustrating what missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| housing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| I think the more people understand it, the better progress we'll make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| And then I'll end with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| I just want to make sure I understand the right expectation for individuals who submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| ordinance changes to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| So although we went through a lot of discussion earlier, can individuals bring ordinance changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| to Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| I guess, Mr. Frost, I'll throw this Frisbee to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| And what should be their expectation when they bring ordinances to Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3896)|

| 1:05:04| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I believe this falls under Article 16.1, Part B, Initiation, City Council, Knoxville, Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3906)|
| 1:05:16| County Planning, city staff, planning staff, or a property owner in the city, or his or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| her designee may propose a zoning text or map amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| After that, you get into Part D, which lays out what's supposed to happen when someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| whether it's Mr. Marlowe or the city or a property owner, goes through and how it eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| gets to City Council for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| So just to maybe follow on, there's supposed to be a yes or no vote of some sort by Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| Commission for these matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| At some point, Planning Commission, Part B, Romanet I, or Romanet I, for zoning text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3956)|
| 1:06:08| amendments, Knoxville, Knox County Planning Commission must recommend approval, approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| with modifications, or denial of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| So the same would apply to rezoning, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| The city is supposed to make a recommendation to the Planning Commissioners who vote, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| all rezonings are approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| My main concern here has been expressed somewhat by my other councilmembers, but it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| all zoning proposals, whether it's this one, ones presented by the administration are properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| vetted by the neighborhoods and the citizens, and that they have a complete opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| however long it takes, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| We don't want to unduly delay, but these affect people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| So any of these zoning changes that are being discussed need to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| My main concern is just that the citizens have a chance to understand it and weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| and give their ideas to make them better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| So I don't have much of a problem, I suppose, remanding it back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4039)|
| 1:07:29| with the understanding, though, that I'll get another look at this if it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| Your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4060)|

| 1:07:47| B, and C, everyone understand what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4073)|

| 1:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| 11A is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Walker Consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| to provide an analysis and recommendations for a strategic downtown Knoxville parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| plan in an amount not to exceed $87,225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Someone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| Mr. Givens, you signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4110)|
| 1:08:40| Now I was just going to crack a one-liner and go, but since you deleted all that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| time for people to speak, I'm going to go ahead and use my full five minutes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| So Tyler Givens, I live in Knoxville, and I am glad that we are finally considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| a parking study for downtown three years after countless citizens raised concerns about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| the taxpayer-funded baseball stadium was going to impact existing residents and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| So glad we're finally getting around to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| Now, you know, parking requirements as part of missing middle, sorry, I'm scrolling back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| to my comments from previous things here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| Public meetings, public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I wanted to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| So last week, I testified at the trial of a local activist who was arrested at a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| The cost for that arrest was later dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| So public meetings are free and open and welcoming to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Also I wanted to have a point of order, which I'm not allowed to do from out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| The chair just literally yelled at a public speaker for speaking without being recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| during Councilmember Parker's time, and then he spoke twice without being recognized during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| Councilmember McKenzie's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| So if you're going to snap at citizens for not following the rules, please be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| Speaking of the rules, if I start talking about the racist history of setbacks, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| mayor may say I'm off topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| So I'm going to talk about OPTICOS, the consultant who provided the original plan aside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| agenda item that we just skipped over a whole bunch of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| The mayor is correct that the OPTICOS plan is not solely based on OPTICOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| A lot of OPTICOS' best suggestions were thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| The administration has a pattern of using third-party contractors to create justifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| rather than listening to best practices and community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| In the case of the stadium, we used the unreliable CSL to do cost-benefit analysis, and before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| construction had even started, we had already taken an additional loan from Randy Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| to cover those cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| During the police chief search, the administration used PERF, an agency that claims to value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| transparency in policing, to conceal records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Based on this pattern...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Mr. Givens, please keep it to the topic of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Do you mind if I repeat the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Stop the time, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Please stop my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Mayor, the rules of decorum are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| This is a limited public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| You're not allowed to limit me on the content of my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| I know you think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| You're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| So if you think you are, get the officers and pull me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| So, based on this pattern, I don't automatically assume that OPTICOS' analysis, filtered through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| the lens of this administration, is reliable or unbiased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| From Karen and Daniel Parolek, the founders of OPTICOS Design, quote, the economic benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| of missing middle housing are only possible in areas where the land is not already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| for large multi-unit buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Missing middle housing is only possible in areas where the land is not already sized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| for large multi-unit buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Zoning for large multi-unit buildings drives up land prices because large multi-unit buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| pack more units of housing per acre and generate a better return on investment than the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| of missing middle that the city is pushing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Quoting the Paroleks, again, the founders of OPTICOS, the company that came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| missing middle, quoting them, it's a fact that building larger buildings, say 125 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| 150 unit apartment or condo building, provides easier to identify and often larger cost efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| than building a 4, 8, or even 16 unit building or series of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Overall, a 50 unit project requires about the same amount of development work to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| as a 150 unit project, but the margins are lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| So a 50 unit missing middle project requires about the same amount of development work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| to execute as a 150 unit mid-rise apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| And it provides a worse return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| By focusing too much on missing middle, such as ADUs and cottage court style developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Knoxville may miss an opportunity to densify in the most resource effective manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| Mid-rise buildings are slightly more expensive to build per unit, but they're also more valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and durable assets overall than OPTICOS style missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| They are also more economically and environmentally friendly to heat and cool and handle water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| and sewer capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Larger constructions also offer more opportunities to combine infrastructure improvements or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| city services like additional bus stops, sidewalks, and better storm water control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Is anybody from the consultant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Mr. Brace, I'll lob these at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| I'm excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4411)|

| 1:13:33| I think there's a lot of creative ways cities are dealing with parking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| I saw some references in our packet to parking management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| Will there be considering recommendations such as market rate charging, automated ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| sensors, privately owned parking lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| Will some of those kind of newer recommendations be part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| I'm going to let Ms. Ball, she's been the lead on this project, but in general this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| is going to be the plan that will drive our parking operation and policies and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| So we've been essentially operating on a system that's been in place for over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| We've made tweaks along the way, but this is really a detailed look so that we can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| out into the future five to ten years, but I'm going to let Ms. Ball answer the detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| question you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| I don't think that we know exactly what the recommendations are going to be from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| consultant at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| That's part of the process we intend to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| So I don't know that I can get specific about which particular items they may or may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I think that is part of the reason that we want to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| We have all seen other cities do great things, but these are the experts in the field and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| have done this literally in thousands of cities across the country, and they do have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| best practices and examples and great management expectations and best practices for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4503)|
| 1:15:12| follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| So that's what we're hoping to glean from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| I have two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| I noticed that community outreach is a part of the scope of work, and I think I saw a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| minimum idea of surveying residents, and I think there was a reference to a stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| I didn't see residents of Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| There's a neighborhood association there, so I would just ask that they be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| or added to that stakeholder group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| And then the last question I had was, given all of the development along the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| why did we limit this to downtown and just come across the bridge briefly on Blount Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| As we were looking at the geographic areas that the city manages property and where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| have residents, visitors, and out-of-town visitors as well as local residents coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4560)|
| 1:16:10| to the downtown area, we were centering the study on the amenities located in the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| area that pull in larger volumes of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| Everything I think there's a list that you could see in our proposal of all of the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| venues that are targeted in that specific geographic area, as well as available parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4587)|
| 1:16:36| that the city of Knoxville manages, or through our PVA partnership we have control over managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| I think we also thought that, I mean we had to draw the boundary at some location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| We believe that what we will gain from this can be taken to other parts of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| and so I think we drew the line because of the assets we had, but we also know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| lessons that will come out of this, we can start to pull those into other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| We've had long discussions about the different opinions around the South Waterfront and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| wish we had more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Please don't add parking, and so we'll look for recommendations that we can stretch across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4637)|

| 1:17:23| And Council, before I go to you, Mr. Thomas, I just, it was, forgive me, I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4643)|

| 1:17:32| Cheryl Ball, Chief Policy Officer, Rebecca Jane Montgomery is Chief of Urban Design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4652)|

| 1:17:44| And then Grant Rosenberg is our new COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4664)|

| 1:17:51| guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Anyhow, sorry, I meant to do that at the beginning, and thank you for being here, and Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| You got lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| I simply think it's important to acknowledge, though, about parking, what the city has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| doing right over many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| The parking garages are quite expansive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| The free parking on nights and weekends, there's available parking on the streets also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| that is free in various locations, some of them under the viaducts that aren't used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| The system now of meters, which are very clearly marked about when they're available and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| So we've done some really good things, I think, about parking, and I think that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| reasons why downtown has done so well in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| So if we do a study and we have recommendations, I'm going to look at it with care to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| sure that they don't change some of the things that we are actually doing right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4742)|

| 1:22:18| And yes, of course, I have signed up tonight to speak against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| I had to remind myself when this all started, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4945)|
| 1:22:37| I went back and I was looking at some articles and some things that were written and talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4957)|
| 1:22:48| about and debated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| None of you all were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| Well, Mr. Frost was here as a council person at the time, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4974)|
| 1:23:02| But I don't think any of the rest of you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| But you know, this, for some of you might look familiar, 2006 Knoxville South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4986)|
| 1:23:18| Vision Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I have to read a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Imagine what we can do by implementing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| We will be able to stroll along the river, go kayaking, take the family out for dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| and entertainment, live and work right across from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| We need to remember that this vision plan describes a 20-year strategy for revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5024)|
| 1:23:54| There's that word, revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| We all know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| People out here know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| By the way, those were the words of our then mayor, Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5046)|
| 1:24:16| It's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| $20 million is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| There was a reason why the federal government, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| Rebuilding American Infrastructure Sustainability Equity Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| There's a reason why this city did not get the federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| I have a feeling that it might have something to do with merit-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5085)|
| 1:24:53| That's how the federal government determines who gets the money from these grants, merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| That's an important word, merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5101)|
| 1:25:13| To read those words and then to hear UT President Randy Boyd speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5113)|
| 1:25:26| the Nalin Entertainment District, oh my god.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| The Nalin Entertainment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| I have a feeling the federal government, maybe their blood doesn't run as orange as some of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5136)|
| 1:25:44| I really think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| It's just a lot of money that could be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| The merit of that money could be spent in so many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| We got $20 million that was supposed to have, was initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| oh, the $20 million has been floating around for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| I just have to say that we can spend our money better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5176)|
| 1:26:25| That's what the RAISE grant is supposed to do, to spend the money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5185)|
| 1:26:37| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| That's what they say on their page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| The transportation at the RAISE enables DOT to examine these projects on their merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| to help ensure that taxpayers are getting the highest value for every dollar invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| And taxpayers don't have to, the taxpayers and the public in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5213)|
| 1:27:02| I know that nothing I am going to say or nothing that anybody else who gets up here to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| is going to sway you all in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| But you just got to know that I know, and you know that I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| and they know, and you know that they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| And we got to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| We got to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you, Ms. Specks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| This is a significant piece of the South Waterfront Vision Plan from 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| One of the things that I had to do, since I didn't have my fingerprints on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| and representing this district, is I had to read that as many times as it took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| to make sure I was aware of all the pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And this bridge, although new to a lot of people, was referenced 15 times in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| So this is not a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| I'm really optimistic about this for a bunch of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| One is it will be another connection between South Knoxville and the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| It will reduce the amount of cars on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| which I think most of the people in this room will appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| and understand the benefits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| It will allow for more recreation access to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| And it will provide more amenities for existing residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| of the South Waterfront Neighborhood Association and Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| both of which have been involved in shaping what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| where the bridge lands on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| I do have a few questions, and I have more questions about the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| who's on our next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| I guess Mr. Brace or RJ, whoever wants to take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| Maybe the new guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Ms. Justice is the lead on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Ms. Justice, what can this money be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| Does it sit aside if we don't win the next raise grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| What else can it be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Do we have to return it to the state if the bridge never happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| Explain the restrictions on these large sums of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| This is an appropriation by the state to support the continued outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| planning and design and construction of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| So those are the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| So it's really just to support the general intent of making this project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| This is not a project that we have the capacity to fund with local dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| but it's really an essential component of our funding mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| to achieve the bridge as a project for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| With our raise application, we received a lot of high remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| Our only weakness was really our committed funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| so we feel very confident that with the committed funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| from the state appropriation that our 2024 application will be strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| How soon can we start spending some of this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| We have a request for an initial drawdown of $1 million to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| and we're going through the process now to transfer that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| And what will that money be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| The same thing, the outreach, planning, the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and the construction of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| but the initial draw will be the subsequent planning with contracts like CDM Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| or public engagement events, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| I don't have any questions for CDM Smith that are technical in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| so I'll just go ahead and give it a whirl here while we're at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| You know, with what I said earlier, while this is a lot to be excited about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| the thing that's very important that I've learned through the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| and seeing plans compared to reality is the importance of following through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| on a vision plan and seeing it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| The most important part for me is how this benefits existing residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| in terms of adding amenities and mitigating unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| And so we've met multiple times and had many open forums with the Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| neighborhood, the South Waterfront neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| and those meetings have been productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| I think I mentioned earlier related to missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| people need to hear it, understand it, have legitimate concerns, raise those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| and the plan needs to adapt based on those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| So I just want to make sure that everyone knows that those conversations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| ongoing, those neighborhoods are working on a list of priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| or guardrails that they want to make sure are woven into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| and I just want to make sure that I can get an affirmative that those types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| of concerns and principles will be woven into where the bridge lands on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Chief Development Justice, I guess my first question is in accepting this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| what obligations come along with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| There's no contract for this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| It's just a direct appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| So the money has to be spent on the overall intent of designing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| preparing to build the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| If we do not build the bridge, we would have a conversation with the state on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| how to give the money back or it doesn't get transferred for just general use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| And just for clarity, the reason I'm asking that is I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| that by accepting this money we're not obligated to build the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| And that if the remaining cost, which could be $50 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| that's not going to be local funds that are going to be allocated towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| That's really the intent of my question about obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| I just want to make sure that if we accept this money that it's only used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| If the bridge doesn't happen, there's no penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| It goes back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| And I'm not going to agree to fund this bridge using local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5598)|
| 1:33:29| So this needs to be taken care of through state funding as well as funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5609)|
| 1:33:37| from the federal government through infrastructure development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| which they're doing through the RAISE grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| The city can't handle doing this type of project with local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| So just to be clear where I am on this, we have spent some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| There's some discussion about spending money on the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| which I'll ask some questions about there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| But I do want to echo what my colleague, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| just said about a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And so we need to make sure that as we go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| that public process is nurtured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| because I think you definitely have to have a lot of discussions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| As I had said previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I see a lot of benefit in this pedestrian bridge for the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| and thereby the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| I see some benefit potentially for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| And so the bulk of this needs to be taken care of by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| I also see that there is some potential to make this a really good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| where we can connect greenways to a pedestrian bridge and gain access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| just like my colleague, Mr. Smith, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| to South Knoxville from other greenways across the river in a more convenient way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| I think those are good things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| But placement of the bridge I think is very important, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| and just going through that public process is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| So those were my questions and comments, and I appreciate your responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| I continue to not support this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| and I've still only heard from one resident in our city who supports it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| that I've spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Everyone else I've spoken with is not in support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| And it feels like a missed opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| especially when we have so many urgent needs in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| to not redirect the funding to those transportation or road projects that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| have reached more agreement on as a city and that have multiple benefits to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| as a city, as city residents, and not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| primarily to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| You know, we've gone through multiple attempts to raise the federal funds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5772)|
| 1:36:21| this project unsuccessfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| and we are somehow celebrating that we can waste more taxpayer dollars towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| this bridge, and those are state tax dollars, not local tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| so it's okay to waste it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| And then send the money back without that benefiting our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| I think there's a better way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| These dollars came forth because the city advocated for the state to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| and just as it advocated for the state to send those dollars for a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| bridge project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| the city could also advocate for those dollars to be reallocated to a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| in our city of a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| That has been vetted more recently than 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5833)|
| 1:37:22| and that has more urgency in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| So I would hate to see $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| even if it's state tax dollars and not local dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| just wasted and thrown around until we have to send it back when we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| actually use those dollars on a project we could move forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| We've applied for federal dollars exactly one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| Is that right, Ms. Justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| And we came really close to getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| and the main reason we didn't get it, according to the reviewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| was we didn't have any commitment from the state yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| When we reapply in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| we're going to be able to say we have a $20 million commitment from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| I also disagree that this is a waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| I think this is reflective of a lot of community input over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| and what Councilmember Smith and Vice Mayor Roberto have said rings true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| We need to continue to get that input and listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| and not just base it on what happened 15 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| but to have those conversations ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I'm pretty confident that the state of Tennessee appropriated this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| specifically for this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| and if we indicate that we're not going to use it for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| they will reallocate it, but not to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| They'll put it to some other thing, who knows what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| But I don't think they'll be very open to suggestions of putting it to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| very high-needs uses, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| this is something that they decided to fund the first time we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| So I do think that is something not to take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Ms. Justice, I've got a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| What are we thinking the total cost of the bridge is at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| I'm sure it will go up, but at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Well, at this point, it is $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| So we've got to plan forward with 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| And then we're hoping to get 25 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| And we're spending part of that $20 million allocation from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| before we even apply for the $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| So we may end up having to return to the state $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| You had said that there were a couple different groups, planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| public input that we were going to be spending some of the money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| We'll be going ahead and spending that before we even know how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| if we're going to get the next amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| What is the plan for the rest of the piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| What is that, 25 at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| In the next item, there is a contract with CDM Smith to do a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| refinement of our current set of plans that does have a $70 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| estimate to look at how the materials, the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| the engineering can be revisited and adjusted to be more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| to be with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| So we're hoping to pull that $70 million down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| It was a very beautiful and robust design when we started out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| and we still want to have a unique bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| but we want to find a better value with our dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| So that's why we're asking CDM Smith to help us refine the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| and pull our costs down, hopefully to somewhere around $55 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| so we have a better structure with our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| I have seen no project cost less over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| Everything goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Well, and we are doing a redesign of this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| So the intent is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| but Tom could probably speak more eloquently about how bridges are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| designed and built, but there are different mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| and ways for the structural soundness to span the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| So there's a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Yes, there's a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| But we still haven't figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Now we're thinking if we're able to bring it down to $55 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| then we don't need any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| To me, this feels like we are furnishing a house that we have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| how we're going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| The other piece is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| what is the distance between this proposed waste of tax funder money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| and the Henley Street Bridge that already exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| What is the distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| The distance between the landings are on the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Tom, can you know the exact distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| Approximately, I would say maybe half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Maybe quarter mile, half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| It's less than a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| So if someone's a walker, there is a way they can walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| For a quarter mile, for a half mile, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| If someone wants to walk, there is a way for them to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| There are two bridges that already have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| I do want to say that part of our raise grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| and some of the viability for this application from the raise grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| was about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Henley is, and those connections for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| are difficult for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| And so it is close, but this would be a strictly pedestrian amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| I would also say that if we, again, the second item is all about looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| at a design of a bridge that's more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| And we'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| If we go in and we can't get a design that's affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| we'll come back to council and say, hey, we don't think we can do this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| We believe we can get this bridge down to about $55 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and that's what this next item is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| So just one last piece before my minute is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| You were talking about the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I've walked across the Henley Street Bridge many, many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| when I was younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Now I have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| But I've walked across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| There are a lot of very dangerous sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| That's not one of the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| There are a lot of places in Knoxville that already are very dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| I would rather spend the money on sidewalks where they are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| that are dangerous than this thing that's a quarter mile away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| from an existing sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| I hear all my colleagues' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I think the reality is this $20 million is offered to us to help pay for a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| The state wants a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| It's been talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| I do think there is value in a pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| And a bicycle bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| Other communities have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| It is a safer way to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Walking across even the Gay Street Bridge as an individual is a little scary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| with cars so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| But be that as it may, the reality is if we don't vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| if we don't accept this $20 million, it's not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| We can't ask for $20 million to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| This is what the state wants to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| So I think the reality is do we give this a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| take some of that $20 million and pay for the design upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| then see what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| If the University of Tennessee wants this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| which is also one of the major employers and economic drivers in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| that generates lots of sales tax revenue off of all the things that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| around the university, then maybe they will help bring it over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| But we can't speak to that until we have some real hard numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| and we apply for a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| If we don't get it, we don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| But if we don't accept this $20 million, this is a missed opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| So I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| A few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| It was mentioned other cities have pedestrian bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| What I've seen largely in other cities, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| are bridges be repurposed to be turned into pedestrian bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| and that's similar to the conversation we've been having in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| about James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| I think that's a great idea, the linear park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| We don't have that much traffic on that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| It would link right into the Neyland Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| go straight over to UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I have no idea what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| building a brand-new bridge when we can just refurbish James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| It makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So, no, I am not in support of this bridge at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| One thing I wanted to ask is if we could clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| I thought we did go after a raised grant in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Ms. Parker, yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| We have applied for money for this bridge two times, 2011 and this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| Tiger, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Tiger, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| So I just want to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| I really think we have other options that are better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| and I believe we have brilliant people in the mayor's office who can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| that argument to the state and shift those dollars over to a project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| we can put them to use immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| I just want to add a little bit more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| I think, where to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| I think there's a reason that the East Tennessee Design Center exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| A lot of times you have to have a design before you can go raise more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| or sell an idea or get additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| So the analogy around building a house, I think, is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| This community non-profits rely on East Tennessee Design Center in a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| You have to have a vision and have to be able to show that vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| and design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Another is, this is not just for UT students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| I want to do some suggestions so that everybody go read the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| the South Knoxville vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| It's a South Knoxville idea that connects to the rest of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| including campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| And building this bridge would bring a lot of assets, including public parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| to the Vestal neighborhood and the South Waterfront neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| none of which have received new sidewalks, parks, greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| aside from Fort Dickerson, which is a big investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| but none of the connections exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Furthermore, if you're on Scottish Pike and need to walk to campus or any part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| of the city, central or west, the idea of walking to James White Parkway east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| about a mile and a half to turn around and come another mile and a half west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| for a full four-mile loop is not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| And I think everybody here that has a vision for a certain thing appreciates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| the initial stages being fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| I also want to point out that I think Mr. Brace described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| and I've been highly cautious of understanding is how this is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| There will be parks built in the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| small parks in different parts of this city that will cost more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| than what Mr. Brace just outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Those numbers will change, can change, and that's part of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| to scrutinize those changes as those come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| I also want to highlight that I may have already said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| but for those members of this body that support Vision Zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| the number of people that will use this bridge will not just be students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| passing back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| It will be residents across South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| Again, I also want to highlight the vision plan that started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| and this is why it's really important, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| for people to think about a vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Not every piece will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Not every piece will happen at different stages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| and I've had to learn this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| I've also had to learn that when you start plucking away different pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| it becomes less a vision and more of a Frankenstein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| and this is part of the vision for the west side of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| and is integral to everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| So if you look at the vision plan, the documents, and read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| I think one of the speakers earlier provided a narrative that sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| exactly what's on the east side of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| and when I talk to those residents every month at the neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| and I speak to them, there's more than one that raised their voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| and they all want to make sure that it lands well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| and that their area gets the same investment that they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| and enjoy on Sevier Avenue, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| The kayaking, the walking, the coffee shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| the sitting and dwelling in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| the people on the west side of Chapman Highway want that the exact same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| the east side of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| and I would beg to differ with anybody who's not at those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| So the people that I think we need to listen to most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| are the people that listen or that live nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| and the reason I bring that up is because I remember a lot of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| around the baseball stadium having a very similar tone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| where we were talking about the people who live nearest and what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| instead of listening to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| and sometimes if you were to listen to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| you might hear that what they wanted was investment in their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| and that part of town much like other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| And as a reminder, while we're on baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| if we wouldn't have had a multi-use stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| what would be there would be private condos that would not be affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| and not be accessible by anybody in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| that needs missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| So I just want to remind folks that the most important thing you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| when you have a vision and investing in a dramatic way like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| is to make sure that the people who live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| get new assets and amenities that they can access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| That is the number one thing I've heard from people in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| The second is do whatever possible to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| whatever unintended consequences could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| when you bring something so significant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| So I just want to make sure for everybody out there watching or here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| that when you listen, listen to the people who are in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| who are talking about this on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| It's hard to have a 24-by-7 public forum for everybody to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| I encourage you to come to some of those conversations with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| If you want to hear from the people who live nearby there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| contact me and come to a meeting, and you can hear what's important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| Yes, like everything that comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| we have to analyze it as cost-benefit, how much money we spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| and what we get for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| As of right now, we really don't know how much the city's contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| is going to be on a possible bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| I don't see any problem, though, with asking for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| with little strings attached, whether it be the states or the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| If the bridge isn't built, we can have discussions with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| about diverting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| I have no way of knowing how those will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| But the bottom line for me is I'm going to wait and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| how much money that we can pull in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| and then see how much money UT will contribute, or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| and then what it will take for the taxpayers in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| to complete what we lack for this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| And that's when I'll make my final decision on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| although the bridge, it would be an amenity for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| The thing that I'm most interested in as kind of a periphery thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| to the bridge, and I've had discussions with Mr. Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| is actually possible, the way it would possibly spur improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| on the highway, on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| and how we could possibly start thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| in terms of building housing along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| And if we can use this development there in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| and bring in Chapman Highway as part of a bigger plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| and really get serious about putting housing on corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| where the infrastructure is already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| and where there's a significant amount of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| instead of trying to shoehorn it here and there into neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| but taking this significant amount of blighted space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| along the corridors, including Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| So those are the discussions as we evaluate the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| I'm looking at ancillary benefits, possible ancillary benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| But as far as asking the state for $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| I don't have any problem doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| There's no strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| Maybe we can keep it and maybe we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| But anyway, that's just a clarification, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| of where I am right at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6885)|

| 1:54:55| Okay, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| with CDM Smith, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| to provide preliminary engineering design services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| for the South Waterfront Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| for an amount not to exceed $475,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| We have one person signed up to speak against this, Ms. Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| If you come to the podium, we already have your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| but come to the podium, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6923)|
| 1:55:53| Tina Sparks, 37917, formerly 379...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6953)|
| 1:56:08| Tommy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| I lived in South Knoxville, I imagine, before you were born,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6971)|
| 1:56:20| or pretty close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| And for 38 years of that time, I lived in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| And there's a lot of stuff that goes on in Vestal, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| And I used to have a thing about South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| And some of you all may have heard me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| I know some of my friends have heard me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| There's South Knoxville, and then there's the real South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| And I was so proud to live in the real South Knoxville, Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Thirty-eight years I lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Before that, I lived on Chapman Highway in married student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| to leave a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| So I know about South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Unfortunately, I don't live there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7029)|
| 1:57:25| I think we need to be very careful when we start talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Councilperson Charlie Thomas, about blighted spaces along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7048)|
| 1:57:36| That sounds awful familiar to me, blighted spaces in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7056)|
| 1:57:49| We're talking about the, I forget which one of you said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| but talking about that this bridge is not going to just benefit UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7073)|
| 1:58:04| and that maybe we can get money from UT for it and thereby go ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7084)|
| 1:58:15| And I am glad to see, I did look a little bit at who is C.D.M. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| They've been around for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| They've been around since 1947, and they're from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| At least they're not from Portland, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| Cat re-envisioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| So that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| And maybe they will have a lot of really good positive things to tell you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| once they get to looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| Again, I'm going to quote from former Mayor Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| I guess I call him Dr. Haslam now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| He's a professor at UT now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Or will be soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| He said that not everything, and I think Councilperson Smith said this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| not everything would be built exactly as shown in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| So we have to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| But we must also be realistic, and it has to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| This is not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| This is not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| I'm going to read one more thing, and then I'm going to sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| because y'all aren't listening to me anyway, so it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| But I'm going to read it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| This is from Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| The public-private partnership opportunity will enhance the look and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| atmosphere of Neyland Stadium and the Knoxville campus while creating an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| additional destination for the city of Knoxville, all without state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7193)|
| 2:00:01| All without state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| Hear those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7208)|
| 2:00:17| Y'all just got to know that what you're doing is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| You know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| We know that you know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| How hard is it for y'all to do the right thing just because it's the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7227)|
| 2:00:35| Talking about, well, what if we spend this much money and then the bridge doesn't happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| We spend $475,000 to CDM Smith, Inc. on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7241)|
| 2:00:51| You're going to spend $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| Well, then you only got $1 million to give back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| This doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| I know I'm just a kindergarten teacher, an old lady from south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| but this does not make sense to me, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Y'all need to get your act together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| This is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| This is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| This is them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| We shouldn't be intimidated by you all or feel like we have to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| and explain why we're mad as hell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| Ms. Sparks, that's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| That's my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7286)|

| 2:01:42| Council members, that concludes people who have signed up to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| I'll move this over to Chief of Development, Rebecca Jane Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7314)|
| 2:02:01| So, in this project now, we're discussing engineering assistance to maybe look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7321)|
| 2:02:12| at a redesign for a pedestrian bridge, looking at whether or not there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| you know, cost differential from the original proposal of around $70 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| bridge, which was done quite some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| Is that basically what we're talking about with this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Ms. Justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| And just where is the money that's being proposed here coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| I remember there was a bridge fund that was put together a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| dealing with this bridge when it was first introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| Is this money being drawn from that old account or is this money being drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| from something we're dealing with currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| It's being drawn from the old account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| And I think the only thing I would just reiterate again is that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| I do see there is some potential for benefit for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I see a lot of potential for other parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| I'm not going to commit, you know, city funds to dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| It needs to be funded by these other partners because the city can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| to do this kind of a project at all on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| And I do applaud the efforts of trying to find maybe a design that's less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| expensive to accomplish a good goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7421)|

| 2:05:45| and all the other, but here's $50,000 in the homeless general fund to enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| street outreach services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7553)|

| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7563)|

| 2:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| So we got on this over here, we're going to spend $70 million on a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7583)|
| 2:06:32| And over here we got people that need a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| And I don't even know that this money is actually going to go, the money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| going to go to, for the, what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7602)|
| 2:06:57| It's going to go to the people who work at VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| And I have nothing against VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| They do a lot of good work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| There are a lot of dedicated people at volunteer ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7630)|
| 2:07:22| It says here that VMC is an amount not to exceed $50,000 for a mobile shower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7642)|
| 2:07:32| trailer program for 300 eligible participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| See, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| We're going to spend $70 million, all told, to be able to walk across that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7658)|
| 2:07:47| river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7667)|

| 2:07:56| But y'all see, there's something not quite right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| Now, I applaud this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7682)|

| 2:08:05| We should have done, we should still be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| On our way here tonight, we come right down Broadway and we see a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| folks that may or may not take advantage of this shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| We saw some people that we see every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| I work downtown and purposely, Rick Roach and I drive Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7706)|
| 2:08:35| We drive Broadway four, five, six times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| And we see the same faces over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| And sometimes we don't see those faces anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| Today, there was a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| There was a fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| And there was a KPD vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7732)|
| 2:08:59| And there was a man that we both recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| And we looked at him and we said, he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7742)|
| 2:09:13| Coming down Broadway is a real eye opener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7753)|
| 2:09:23| Just think what $20 million would do down on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| Just think of how many people could have a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| Could sit down and read a book in a cool place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| How many people could get the help that they needed with their substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| $20 million could be spent a lot of better ways than what y'all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7791)|
| 2:09:59| COVID highlighted the necessity to enhance and expand the delivery of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| engagement services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| No, we didn't need COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| If we needed COVID to tell us to do the right thing, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7808)|
| 2:10:17| We should have been doing it all along and we still should be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| COVID, no COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| And I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| Mr. Roach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7829)|
| 2:10:42| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| Everything she said, a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Yeah, come through there a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| But here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| I'm going to say it again, what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| $50,000 to keep your body clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| To refresh you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| We all, you all take it for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| $20 million to walk across and bike across a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7877)|
| 2:11:27| Priority, commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| We want to talk about, David, I'm sorry, safety of walking across the Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| Bridge or the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| No comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Because that is a reason why you would want to build a bridge just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| directly to the UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| Basically what it would do, let's be honest, all that bridge would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| would be to make it easier to go see the volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7921)|
| 2:12:08| Go big orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| And I'm the biggest UT sports fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| But I don't need it if I'm coming from south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| There's a problem with commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| $20 million, I'm going to repeat, $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| Just think what that would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7955)|
| 2:12:42| Instead you've got people like Ms. Sparks, myself, others, we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| stand up here and talk to you guys and act like fools just to get you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| consider doing a common sense thing and putting it in its proper place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| terms of priorities for the people, the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| And y'all are scrambling, sitting up here trying to explain what you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| and will not do and what you can and cannot do with the excess money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| you're going to spend of state money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| Mobile, $50,000, ain't going to cover nothing if you're paying attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| where the homeless are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| They're in all parts of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| All parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| You're going to go hunt them down, say, come on, let's take a shower today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| get cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| We can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| We can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I'm telling you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| I might go over just to save on the water bill if you're going to go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| have a mobile station set up in East Knoxville somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| I might just go over there and take advantage even though I'm not homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8039)|
| 2:14:08| You know, I'll save on the water bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| But we're in bad shape right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| We're in bad shape right now in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| And it's like right now there are other things that we should be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| attention to and prioritizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| But it's nothing compared to arguing about what we're going to do with $20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| million of state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| And you all can't make a commitment to take care of the least of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8091)|

| 2:16:59| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| Chief, can you explain the need for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8225)|
| 2:17:12| I know it's no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Are we having a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| There's a lot of extra duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| There's not enough extra duty, overtime to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| so that they have to go get a part-time job somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| security or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| I know I see a lot of police presence in East Knoxville in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| in Northeast Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| Can you speak to that as to why this is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| why you need to have at no cost off-duty management to provide scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| of police officers for off-duty employment at no cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| Council Members, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| People signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| Council Member Parker and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8284)|
| 2:18:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| My comments might speak to some of the questions Mr. Roach raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8291)|
| 2:18:18| but then I'll ask the Chief to fill in some of those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| But I'm in favor of this measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| and the reason I'm in favor of it is because we currently have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| according to our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| we currently have an officer assigned to carry out these responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| but that would shift these responsibilities over to this scheduling company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8318)|
| 2:18:47| and then the cost would be built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| So if the current rate is $50 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| the rate would then go up to $55 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| and that $5 would go towards paying for this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| So it seems like a good idea to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| I think I can't speak to the policy pieces too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| but I do remember when this became an issue in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| and I do believe a policy was adopted requiring KPD officers to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| the department to be assigned to these after-hour, not after-hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8357)|
| 2:19:24| Secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Yeah, to these secondary positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| So it's a policy of the city that these off-duty hours are scheduled within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8368)|
| 2:19:35| the department, and now this would be handled by a third-party consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| Chief Noel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| So what you're speaking of is previously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| years ago the offices were basically free agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| They can negotiate directly with individual businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| They were employees of those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| They were paid directly by these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| In 2015, this policy was put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| It went in, you know, a lot of ways, resolved some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| This goes further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| This puts the Knoxville Police Department in line with national best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| So instead of having a police employee managing these off-duty jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| right now the officers are still paid directly by the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| and we have no way of really tracking all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| Everything now has to go through this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| So if you work an off-duty job, a sub-secondary employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| everything has to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| You are paid through this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| The company provides $15 million of liability insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| and workers' compensation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| It's kind of a gray area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| And really, again, this is just something that's a national best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| It gets an individual police officer out of the scheduling business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| and it puts it in a fair and transparent way through this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| Council Member Puget and then Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| Chief Noel, I assume this also applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| Oftentimes organizations ask for a police officer to be at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| Schools do an after-school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| This would be the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| They would go through this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| So it's not just – correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| but I know that I've had to do that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| And so it's not just secondary employment with full-time employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| It could be for special events that citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| or organizations ask for an off-duty police officer to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| So anyone that's hiring a police officer for what we call secondary employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| being paid not by an actual police department but paid by a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| every one of those jobs will have to go through this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8506)|
| 2:21:47| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| This is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| The hours that patrol were working, the 12-hour shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| is that something that's still going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| and just still concerned about how rough that's been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| Yes, ma'am, they are still working 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| Is that – do they get to choose if that's something they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| or is that just mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| Officers who work in our districts on patrol shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| that's the shifts that we're working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| They work 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8534)|

| 2:22:19| So they have a lot of time off built around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Basically it averages out still to about a 40-hour work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8541)|

| 2:22:39| Council, if it's okay, I think we should take a brief break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8559)|

| 2:23:06| Would you read Item 12A, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8586)|

| 2:24:19| Council members, there's two people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| The first is Larry Silverstein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| signed up to speak against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| and Mr. Givens is signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| Oh, this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| Do I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| Okay, so I'm sorry, Mr. Givens who speaks in favor goes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| Sorry, Mr. Silverstein, you'll be up in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| Is Mr. Givens here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8688)|
| 2:24:58| Always, you're not having fun, you're not doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| Maybe UT could get a sponsor for the bridge so one day you can walk across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8701)|

| 2:25:11| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| I support the ordinance in front of us with one simple amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Leave the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| So that would be strike both instances of line one in the preamble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| so eliminate the requirement for owner-occupied, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| Delete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| And then in section 10.3.2 of the attached exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| leave the existing text of the code unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| So leave the owner-occupied requirement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| and accept all of the other amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I strongly support the proposed adjustments to make it easier to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| ADUs on smaller lots and to also allow slightly larger ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8746)|

| 2:25:55| more and more people are facing rent increases and evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| A friend or a family member with extra space can be a lifesaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| An ADU renter can help folks on fixed incomes keep up with tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8763)|
| 2:26:07| and maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| The administration's plan wants to limit even modest multiplexes to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| approval process and has already identified areas where it will allow such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| In the Inskip and Fountain City areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| the old Virginia College location would actually be a fantastic place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| develop a mid-rise apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| It's close to a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| It's within walking distance of a full-service grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| And missing middle housing is probably a good option for some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| Inskip infill, but again, we need to focus on some more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| more than what missing middle has to offer in the places where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| The other locations identified by the plan are the Magnolia Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| from North Broadway East to Rutledge Pike and Alice Bell and the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8809)|
| 2:26:55| Knoxville and Morningside areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| None of these areas have convenient grocery stores, which is sort of odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| There are a lot of food marts along Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| but I'm not sure that any of them have fresh produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| There was supposed to be a grocery store at Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| Another off-sided concern in these projects is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| People are coming and people are traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| Fighting against density isn't going to reduce congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| It's better to have density spread around the whole city rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| stuffed into a select area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| The solution to traffic problems is more density and more people able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| live close to where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| It's better for more folks to spend a couple minutes on a surface road than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| to spend hours clogging up arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| Increased downtown neighborhood density will likely increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| ridership of our new electric buses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| Some other arguments we may hear tonight are harder to politely address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8864)|
| 2:27:51| so I'll try to be clear with this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| I would not say that all people talking about preserving neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| qualities and character are racists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| but I will say that racists like to talk about preserving neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| qualities and character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| Frankly, I don't like the idea that my neighbor down the street can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| whether or not I build an ADU for my ailing mother on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| If folks want to control neighborhood character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| they can form an HOA and I'll try to get on the board and dissolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| The government has no business picking which private citizens can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| code-compliant structures on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| Special use permitting is overly complicated and ripe for abuse to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| This is the smallest increment of density that we could possibly apply citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| So let's support the necessary density increase in an equitable and just way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8922)|
| 2:28:49| but keep the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8929)|

| 2:29:37| is much different from what Planning Commission approved on August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| It now includes maintaining in its entirety the present zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| requirement of owner occupancy of either the ADU or the primary dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=8987)|

| 2:30:00| and then the Planning Commission staff should review it and make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| recommendation to the Planning Commission, which will then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9004)|

| 2:30:57| owner occupation requirement for either the ADU or the principal dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| There are still significant issues regarding the proposed amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| both as modified by the Planning Commission and what is now being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9066)|

| 2:31:23| problematic issues with the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| These included issues regarding the minimum size of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| a limit on maximum gross floor area, rear lot setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| and maximum height of the ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| Some of these issues remain even after the Planning Commission's August 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9096)|

| 2:32:15| It just isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| So we urge you to vote to send back this item to Knox Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| let the public process for missing middle housing take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| rather than to rush to approve a zoning amendment without adequate public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| discussion and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9152)|

| 2:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| The owner occupancy requirement that went into the accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| piece went through an extensive series of changes during the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| that I know several of us remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| That was debated very thoroughly in a public process where there was notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9181)|
| 2:33:08| to folks and we had a lot of public participation throughout that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9188)|
| 2:33:16| One of the things identified in that debate was unintended consequences that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9196)|
| 2:33:22| could occur from not having owner occupancy for the accessory dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| I'm also interested in hearing from staff on this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| because staff didn't really get a chance to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| It was done on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| And I've seen multiple amendments coming through here in the last few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| about what this is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| So my recommendation would be to send this back to planning to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| and in that review my message to planning staff and to the commissioners is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9234)|
| 2:34:02| that council has thoroughly reviewed and debated this issue about owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| occupancy, and that really should not be touched without some very serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9248)|
| 2:34:14| consideration of the unintended consequence of doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9254)|
| 2:34:19| So I'll make a motion that we send this back to planning for that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| Motion made to send this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Remand this back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| It's been made by Vice Mayor Roberto, seconded by Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| I'm not sure whose mic was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| Councilmember Singh, then Ryder, and then Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| I'd like to ask Peter Ahrens to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| I think he's got some good information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| Aren't we supposed to only be speaking to the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| I just want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| Well, the motion is to remand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| I'm wondering about your opinion if we should send it back right now or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9311)|
| 2:35:12| Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| That's totally up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| What else you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| I can speak to how these proposals impact enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| if that's what you want to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| I won't dive into the owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| That's up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| I can tell you that that is difficult to enforce after the initial ADU is constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| We do that now, and I think we do a very good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| We don't regulate the sale of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| We don't track where ADUs are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9346)|
