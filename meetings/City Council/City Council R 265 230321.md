|     777 |   782 | I just wondered if there is somebody who can educate us on this item,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=777.0)  |
|     782 |   787 | just talk about it, tell us what it is in general.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=782.0)  |
|     788 |   790 | Go ahead, Mr. Clabo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=788.0)  |
|     790 |   792 | Thanks for the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=790.0)  |
|     792 |   799 | So this ordinance amendment is addressing three different issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=792.0)  |
|     799 |   807 | One of those is there's currently a requirement to apply stormwater easements,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=799.0)  |
|     807 |   813 | access easements, and any control easements at the front of the project,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=807.0)  |
|     813 |   816 | and we're going to move that requirement to the end of the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=813.0)  |
|     816 |   821 | So you need to get that work done before you have a certificate of occupancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=816.0)  |
|     821 |   824 | So it's really an issue of timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=821.0)  |
|     824 |   828 | Sometimes that holds projects up trying to get through the planning process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=824.0)  |
|     828 |   832 | So by moving it to the end, we still get the requirements, get the access we need,                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=828.0)  |
|     832 |   835 | but it doesn't hold the project up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=832.0)  |
|     835 |   843 | The second issue was there's minor revisions to what we're using as hydrologic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=835.0)  |
|     843 |   848 | design standards, so it's something the industry is using,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=843.0)  |
|     848 |   854 | and we've been using that or allowing that kind of on a case-by-case basis,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=848.0)  |
|     854 |   859 | but it's something we need to kind of codify, so we're going to allow that change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=854.0)  |
|     859 |   868 | And then the last one is this idea of defining a threshold for substantial improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=859.0)  |
|     868 |   877 | So in that case, right now it was a 50% improvement with no minimum or floor to that,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=868.0)  |
|     877 |   881 | and we're going to set that to $500,000 in improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=877.0)  |
|     881 |   889 | So it really assists with smaller projects or projects where the property value may not be as much,                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=881.0)  |
|     889 |   895 | so those smaller projects were being kicked into doing a lot of stormwater improvements,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=889.0)  |
|     896 |   899 | even with minor renovations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=896.0)  |
|     899 |   906 | So by setting this threshold, it prevents that from adversely impacting development                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=899.0)  |
|     906 |   908 | and smaller developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=906.0)  |
|     908 |   912 | My only concern is stormwater becomes a bigger and bigger issue over time,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=908.0)  |
|     912 |   920 | so I know that you guys keep that in consideration and are aware of that also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=912.0)  |

|     921 |   926 | Yeah, I just, for the record, again, I'm going to restate that I made the motion,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=921.0)  |

|     935 |   939 | hopefully in the future, which involves the definition of a lot of record,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=935.0)  |
|     939 |   950 | because everything in our historic areas of town prior to 1950-something, which is about 60-plus percent,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=939.0)  |

|     995 |  1001 | and we've made a commitment for when that will come before this body that it has not and will not change.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=995.0)  |

|    1008 |  1015 | Right now, we're requiring developments to record a plat so that we have the stormwater easements in place                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1008.0) |

|    1121 |  1129 | to honor integrated baseball games played on Sutherland Field from the 30s, 40s, into the 50s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1121.0) |
|    1129 |  1135 | It was quite common on a Sunday afternoon to watch an integrated audience watch integrated games played.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1129.0) |
|    1135 |  1138 | And in Pond Gap, we said that baseball for us was more than a game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1135.0) |
|    1138 |  1141 | It's a way people should treat one another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1138.0) |
|    1141 |  1149 | And the reasoning behind this honorary name change is because the good power hitters could hit a home run ball across Sutherland from the field.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1141.0) |
|    1149 |  1158 | In fact, one spring day in 1950, the house on Hollywood at 500, Mrs. Cozart was hanging her laundry up in the backyard.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1149.0) |
|    1158 |  1161 | When here comes a home run ball that lands in her laundry basket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1158.0) |
|    1161 |  1169 | So this gave us the idea, well, let's call this Home Run Alley to draw attention to how important baseball can be for the community.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1161.0) |

|    1173 |  1180 | and a little bit of then McGee Tyson Airport before it moved in 1937 to the present location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1173.0) |
|    1180 |  1187 | So it would honor us if you would pass this resolution and we can call it Home Run Alley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1180.0) |

|    1273 |  1275 | It's good to see him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1273.0) |
|    1275 |  1279 | So we've been negotiating through law on a five-year renewal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1275.0) |
|    1279 |  1285 | And then there was a request to have a meeting between some community members and Emerald and the city                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1279.0) |
|    1285 |  1291 | and the executive members and lawyers with the Tennessee Valley Authority,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1285.0) |
|    1291 |  1298 | excuse me, with the fair about some other opportunities on the parking lot that they use for the fair.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1291.0) |
|    1298 |  1304 | So we had discussions with the leadership for the fair about getting the one-year done                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1298.0) |
|    1304 |  1307 | while we continue to have discussions about that parking lot,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1304.0) |
|    1307 |  1318 | because right now there are some other potential opportunities on that space in the future that people wanted to talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1307.0) |

|    1538 |  1542 | they've pointed out projects where things could have been done a little bit better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1538.0) |

|    2616 |  2622 | So some of these questions, including the kind of concepts around cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2616.0) |
|    2622 |  2634 | and how this relates to the work is available on an FAQ page that we have put on KnoxvilleTN.gov slash R-T-I-C.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2622.0) |

|    2636 |  2639 | We will also be adding additional information to that page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2636.0) |
|    2639 |  2644 | As Chief Noel described, the scope gets further built out, and we have additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2639.0) |
|    2644 |  2649 | I'll also mention to this body that should you decide to have a workshop on this topic,                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2644.0) |
|    2649 |  2655 | we are totally willing and would be glad to have that as a space for additional discussion for you, if you so choose.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2649.0) |

|    2656 |  2660 | And if I could add, you know, there's no secret on how we would use this center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2656.0) |
|    2660 |  2665 | I've spoken about it probably at least 50 times in a public forum, including today at the Downtown Rotary Club.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2660.0) |
|    2665 |  2668 | You know, we went into detail on how we would use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2665.0) |
|    2668 |  2672 | So even though we don't have the software, we're not running it yet, exceptionally,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2668.0) |
|    2672 |  2678 | we have – you know, we know how we're going to use this and how this is going to help keep people in our community safe.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2672.0) |

|    2684 |  2689 | I just wanted to follow up on what Ms. Gill said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2684.0) |
|    2689 |  2696 | and reemphasize that I am in support of a workshop on the real-time crime center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2689.0) |
|    2696 |  2703 | That would include my surveillance ordinance that I really, really want to bring before City Council for a workshop.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2696.0) |

|    2719 |  2723 | and there may be a lot of members of the public listening, that this might be the first time they've heard about it.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2719.0) |
|    2723 |  2727 | So maybe you could tell us what you told us at Rotary Club today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2723.0) |
|    2727 |  2730 | or talk a little bit more about what the real-time crime center will do,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2727.0) |
|    2730 |  2733 | what will these employees do that you just talked about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2730.0) |
|    2733 |  2734 | Sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2733.0) |
|    2734 |  2740 | So there's two primary ways where a real-time crime center, a real-time information center operates in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2734.0) |
|    2740 |  2745 | The first part is that the majority of this will be used will be after the fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2740.0) |
|    2745 |  2752 | So when a crime occurs, if a crime either occurred in front of a camera, a city camera, or if –                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2745.0) |

|    2755 |  2757 | Oh, the cameras that are outstationed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2755.0) |
|    2757 |  2758 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2757.0) |
|    2758 |  2759 | So this is not connected –                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2758.0) |
|    2759 |  2760 | Nothing to do with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2759.0) |
|    2760 |  2764 | This is not connected to our body cameras or our in-car cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2760.0) |
|    2764 |  2767 | Actually, and I'm glad you actually brought that up, I'm glad you asked that question,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2764.0) |
|    2767 |  2773 | because if you go on that frequently asked question page we have on our website, we actually address that.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2767.0) |
|    2773 |  2777 | So it does not tap into the body cameras or the real-time crime centers directly,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2773.0) |
|    2777 |  2783 | but a camera that we would put on a pole, a real-time crime camera would be mounted on a pole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2777.0) |
|    2783 |  2785 | It would have a city logo on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2783.0) |
|    2785 |  2790 | It would be able to clearly see that it's a camera, and you could go look at Chattanooga.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2785.0) |

|    2932 |  2936 | I just had a follow-up question based on that conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2932.0) |
|    2936 |  2945 | One thing you mentioned is the cameras will allow you to identify a suspect if their face appears on the camera.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2936.0) |
|    2945 |  2953 | Can you tell us more about how you would be able to identify individuals through that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2945.0) |
|    2953 |  2958 | Well, if someone passes in front of a camera, like on foot,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2953.0) |
|    2958 |  2964 | we would have a picture of them that we could then put on the news or show to a potential witness.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2958.0) |
|    2964 |  2967 | It would give us more information than we would have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2964.0) |
|    2967 |  2977 | Say, for example, we have a witness that says a person committed a murder wearing a blue T-shirt and green pants,                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2967.0) |
|    2977 |  2980 | but they had a mask on or they did not see their face,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2977.0) |
|    2980 |  2985 | and then literally moments after we have them passing in front of a camera                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2980.0) |
|    2985 |  2990 | and we have a be able to get a still shot of that person's face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2985.0) |
|    2990 |  2997 | That's one additional piece of the puzzle to help us identify who that individual would be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2990.0) |
|    2997 |  3004 | Some of the concerns with this technology have been that, you know, for a license plate reader,                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2997.0) |
|    3004 |  3011 | the video has improved to the point where you can capture a license plate,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3004.0) |
|    3011 |  3018 | but facial details are still not something that we can really capture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3011.0) |
|    3018 |  3032 | We've even had instances in Knoxville where we've seen gun violence happen directly underneath a KCDC camera,                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3018.0) |

|    3122 |  3133 | One is I'm surprised about the price that you quoted because I believe I read recently that it was about $26,000 for Chattanooga to replace a camera.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3122.0) |
|    3133 |  3137 | So my thinking of the cost of cameras is a lot higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3133.0) |
|    3137 |  3148 | And then the other thing is I appreciate what you're sharing about needing further investigation when you capture that image                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3137.0) |
|    3148 |  3158 | because where this technology has caused problems in other cities is if you take that image and try to run it through a database to figure out who that person is                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3148.0) |
|    3158 |  3170 | and then you take action based upon what you find from that database and then we have warrants being served to the wrong location                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3158.0) |
|    3170 |  3174 | and individuals being arrested who should not have been.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3170.0) |
|    3174 |  3176 | And those are some of the concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3174.0) |
|    3176 |  3183 | Of course, this technology does not work well for women's faces, people of color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3176.0) |
|    3183 |  3190 | And so these are the individuals who tend to be incorrectly identified using this technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3183.0) |
|    3190 |  3191 | Well, that's just bad police work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3190.0) |
|    3191 |  3196 | I mean, we put pictures out every day when someone calls up and says, you know, I believe that's John Doe.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3191.0) |
|    3196 |  3200 | You know, we don't discount that and we don't go get an arrest warrant based upon that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3196.0) |
|    3200 |  3207 | That is just another piece of the puzzle and we have to continue to investigate and use that information.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3200.0) |
|    3207 |  3212 | That information could potentially help us establish probable cause,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3207.0) |
|    3212 |  3219 | but there is no way that just someone calling up or any database or anything else saying that is the person on that image                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3212.0) |
|    3219 |  3225 | and then us just moving forward and getting an arrest warrant, there's no way that that is enough to beat the threshold of probable cause.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3219.0) |
|    3225 |  3227 | It's just another tool in our tool belt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3225.0) |
|    3227 |  3233 | And it's another thing to help us to potentially identify potential perpetrators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3227.0) |
|    3233 |  3239 | And my time is up, so I hope that you will support an effort to put that position in policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3233.0) |
|    3239 |  3241 | I think we need it in policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3239.0) |

|    3244 |  3246 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3244.0) |
|    3246 |  3252 | And so I just want to put out there that there is actually a series called Real Time Crime where it shows actual cases.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3246.0) |
|    3252 |  3258 | I know that there's, I think they're in the second episode of how surveillance cameras have helped to solve crime,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3252.0) |
|    3258 |  3260 | so that might be a good point of reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3258.0) |
|    3260 |  3266 | What I will say is I'm surprised, as Council Member Parker said, at the cost of each camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3260.0) |
|    3266 |  3271 | What I would say is that if we're going to do this and we're going to invest in this as a mechanism to help prevent                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3266.0) |
|    3271 |  3278 | and also solve crime is that we get a higher quality of camera, no disrespect to KCDC,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3271.0) |
|    3279 |  3284 | but we know in the past that there have been incidents that have happened right under cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3279.0) |
|    3284 |  3291 | and it was so grainy that there was nothing that we could use as evidence in those particular homicides.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3284.0) |
|    3291 |  3296 | So I would encourage us, and I know that you guys will look and see what's the best technology that's out there,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3291.0) |
|    3296 |  3303 | but if this is an investment that we're going to make, I would hope that we're going to get a higher quality of technology                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3296.0) |
|    3303 |  3312 | where it will be able to help us identify not just perpetrators, vehicles and tags, those types of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3303.0) |
|    3312 |  3313 | I really appreciate those remarks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3312.0) |
|    3313 |  3319 | So one thing, when I talk publicly about people getting cameras for their own home or business,                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3313.0) |
|    3319 |  3322 | the thing I always say is there's nothing worse than a cheap camera                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3319.0) |
|    3322 |  3329 | because we've all seen that picture of Bigfoot and you get nothing worse than us saying,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3322.0) |
|    3329 |  3335 | yeah, we caught the perpetrator on camera and then you get that blurry looking Bigfoot picture that we really can't do much with.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3329.0) |
|    3335 |  3338 | And sometimes on the news you do see that where it looks like it's like a blur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3335.0) |
|    3338 |  3346 | So the cheap cameras will do a decent job during the day, but at night or in low light they perform very, very poorly.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3338.0) |
|    3346 |  3352 | So the cameras that we will invest in would be the highest quality camera                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3346.0) |
|    3352 |  3357 | that would give us high resolution images at night and during the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3352.0) |
|    3357 |  3362 | The cameras that they have in New Orleans, and again, we've not scoped out what camera system we're going to go with                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3357.0) |
|    3362 |  3368 | or what software or hardware, they could read a police officer's name tag from a block away at night on Bourbon Street.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3362.0) |
|    3368 |  3370 | And I've personally seen that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3368.0) |
|    3370 |  3379 | And it certainly does not mean that in every scenario a block away you're going to be able to get a perfect image.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3370.0) |
|    3379 |  3383 | Someone wearing a baseball cap or someone's in shadows or someone's moving really quickly,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3379.0) |
|    3384 |  3389 | cameras are not perfect, but the technology out there is very, very impressive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3384.0) |
|    3389 |  3394 | And if you could read a name tag like I have here at a block away, that's pretty impressive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3389.0) |
|    3394 |  3395 | Absolutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3394.0) |
|    3395 |  3404 | And so my point of reference is when we have a group of 100 or more people on an incident that happened                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3395.0) |

|    3410 |  3415 | and no one was able to see who the shooters were or came forward with information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3410.0) |

|    3423 |  3427 | Chief Noel, I know that we ask a lot of the police department, right, we want you to solve the crimes,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3423.0) |
|    3427 |  3431 | and everything that you described I completely support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3427.0) |
|    3431 |  3437 | We do need more puzzle pieces to figure out where harm is happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3431.0) |

|    3444 |  3449 | you and I have spoken about the cameras, the doorbell cameras,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3444.0) |
|    3449 |  3453 | and that they are willing to send to the police departments that information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3449.0) |
|    3453 |  3456 | I know they have not offered that to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3453.0) |
|    3456 |  3466 | So my concerns are about technology being used for good or sliding into something that's more dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3456.0) |
|    3466 |  3475 | And I would want to be reassured that before we move any further with the real-time center, once it's up,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3466.0) |
|    3475 |  3482 | that we don't get further and further into more invasive technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3475.0) |

|    3490 |  3500 | Chief, I think a lot of the concerns are just from not knowing what the expertise that you have or what's planned.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3490.0) |

|    3695 |  3699 | Obviously, if we don't have any employees or if we don't have any hardware or software installed yet,                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3695.0) |
|    3699 |  3700 | we won't be there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3699.0) |
|    3700 |  3703 | But, you know, tentatively we're looking at the fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3700.0) |
|    3703 |  3707 | But I would probably say that's a pretty ambitious timeline right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3703.0) |
|    3707 |  3708 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3707.0) |
|    3708 |  3714 | With regards to us, if we schedule a different meeting to have further discussion about policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3708.0) |
|    3714 |  3721 | Chief Powell, do you have anything to add on that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3714.0) |
|    3721 |  3725 | And I keep picking on Chief Powell, but, you know, Chief Powell is the lead on this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3721.0) |
|    3725 |  3729 | So, Deputy Chief Powell, and again, I wish I had more answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3725.0) |
|    3729 |  3731 | This is the first real-time crime center I've stood up,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3729.0) |
|    3731 |  3737 | so I'm kind of scratching and itching along here by myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3731.0) |
|    3737 |  3740 | 21CP, they will help us tremendously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3737.0) |
|    3740 |  3742 | I don't want to get the horse before the cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3740.0) |
|    3742 |  3747 | Again, we're looking at demo on different software packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3742.0) |
|    3747 |  3753 | Once we get through the pass today and once we see that the construction has started,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3747.0) |
|    3753 |  3758 | then we'll start looking at software packages, the camera packages, see where we are money-wise.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3753.0) |
|    3758 |  3765 | And then at that time, I'll move on to the next phase while my folks are helping me get in the software.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3758.0) |
|    3765 |  3767 | Then we'll start looking at policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3765.0) |
|    3767 |  3773 | In this process, we already have built strong relationships with Chattanooga, Tulsa, Oklahoma,                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3767.0) |
|    3773 |  3777 | and New Orleans real-time crime center as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3773.0) |
|    3777 |  3782 | So I'm talking with them through this process, taking, borrowing policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3777.0) |
|    3782 |  3784 | I like Tulsa's policy on one part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3782.0) |
|    3784 |  3786 | I like Chattanooga's policy here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3784.0) |
|    3786 |  3789 | So we'll take all of those policies together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3786.0) |
|    3789 |  3791 | We'll put them down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3789.0) |
|    3791 |  3794 | Then we'll get with 21CP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3791.0) |
|    3794 |  3795 | Again, let them look over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3794.0) |
|    3795 |  3799 | They've got a national idea of what policy should look like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3795.0) |
|    3799 |  3804 | and then we'll whittle out from the big bag of pulled policies from all across the nation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3799.0) |
|    3804 |  3806 | and come up with our own policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3804.0) |
|    3806 |  3811 | Okay, so looking up Chattanooga, they also have access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3806.0) |
|    3811 |  3814 | It says they access 3,000 cameras across Chattanooga.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3811.0) |
|    3814 |  3816 | Fifty-three are owned by the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3814.0) |
|    3816 |  3820 | So they're tapping into cameras that don't belong to the city as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3816.0) |
|    3820 |  3824 | Is that our intent on the long frame?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3820.0) |
|    3824 |  3827 | Well, that's our intent, but first we've got to establish those MOUs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3824.0) |
|    3827 |  3831 | We would like to have MOUs with KCDC, UT, PBA,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3827.0) |
|    3831 |  3834 | whoever would give that with us to work in policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3831.0) |
|    3834 |  3839 | Chattanooga started out with very few cameras, but when they first came online,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3834.0) |
|    3839 |  3844 | they had MOUs with these different agencies to tap into their cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3839.0) |

|    3847 |  3852 | Okay, and then in doing the math from the news articles for the cameras that they purchased                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3847.0) |

|    3869 |  3875 | They just bought 11 more because they had a shooting where there were three people dead                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3869.0) |
|    3875 |  3879 | and 14 others shot, and it turned out the camera was inoperable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3875.0) |
|    3879 |  3882 | And they found that they had six inoperable cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3879.0) |
|    3882 |  3886 | So I hope as part of our policies, if we're going to do this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3882.0) |
|    3886 |  3892 | that there's some monitoring maintenance of are the cameras actually functioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3886.0) |
|    3892 |  3894 | Yes, ma'am, that will definitely be the part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3892.0) |
|    3894 |  3900 | So New Orleans, they have their own crew that goes out and takes care of the cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3894.0) |
|    3900 |  3902 | rather than hiring it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3900.0) |
|    3902 |  3906 | The city has city services that could help assist with that as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3902.0) |
|    3906 |  3907 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3906.0) |
|    3907 |  3908 | But that's very important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3907.0) |
|    3908 |  3909 | You're correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3908.0) |
|    3909 |  3912 | And one thing we would have in a software package is a software package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3909.0) |
|    3912 |  3915 | that will actually alert you if a camera goes offline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3912.0) |
|    3915 |  3919 | And, you know, as far as accessing cameras,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3915.0) |
|    3919 |  3923 | those are cameras that people would voluntarily give us access to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3919.0) |
|    3923 |  3930 | There's no way that we would have the ability to tap into a camera against someone's will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3923.0) |
|    3930 |  3935 | If a business or an entity wanted to allow us to be able to access those cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3930.0) |
|    3935 |  3937 | with the right software package,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3935.0) |
|    3937 |  3943 | then we would be able to feed that information into the real-time information center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3937.0) |
|    3943 |  3948 | But I also would like to clarify that those cameras are not going to be monitored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3943.0) |

|    4449 |  4455 | Yeah, I just was going to say on the vein, I see it as suspending the rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4449.0) |
|    4455 |  4461 | I know that's not what our rules are, which we can have a discussion about that another day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4455.0) |
|    4461 |  4463 | That is how it's done at Planning Commission, I believe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4461.0) |
|    4463 |  4466 | It's five minutes per side, is that correct, Mr. Welch?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4463.0) |
|    4466 |  4467 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4466.0) |
|    4467 |  4471 | Okay, and it's not about numbers of speakers, it's about time per side?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4467.0) |
|    4471 |  4472 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4471.0) |
|    4472 |  4473 | Okay, thank you for clarifying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4472.0) |
|    4473 |  4478 | So that was the basis of me seconding that motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4473.0) |
|    4478 |  4487 | Okay, so to be clear, the motion is there will be the three speakers who are speaking for                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4478.0) |
|    4487 |  4491 | would get five minutes each for a total of 15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4487.0) |
|    4491 |  4498 | The speakers against, who number in six, would be given two and a half minutes each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4491.0) |
|    4498 |  4501 | So everyone clear on what the motion is?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4498.0) |
|    4501 |  4502 | Okay, any further discussion?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4501.0) |

|    4529 |  4532 | I just want to make sure I understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4529.0) |
|    4532 |  4539 | The speakers for, including this gentleman, get five minutes each, is that correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4532.0) |
|    4539 |  4543 | The motion was that each side will get 15 minutes each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4539.0) |
|    4543 |  4549 | So the speakers for will get five minutes, because that will allow for 15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4543.0) |
|    4549 |  4553 | Speakers against, who number more, will get two and a half minutes each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4549.0) |

|    4565 |  4573 | I live about two-thirds of a mile away from this development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4565.0) |
|    4573 |  4582 | I'm strongly supportive of this, because when it comes down to it, we need more housing, period.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4573.0) |
|    4582 |  4585 | And here's the deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4582.0) |
|    4585 |  4596 | The NIMBY problem that we have in America is out of control, and not building housing is not fixing our problem.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4585.0) |
|    4596 |  4607 | So that seems to be a common theme among some people, that they just are so resistant to change that they can't see that this is something that's really needed.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4596.0) |

|    4649 |  4661 | But people feel like they can't come here because they have nowhere to live, because the dorms are full, and there's no housing available that's affordable.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4649.0) |
|    4662 |  4667 | And it's supply and demand, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4662.0) |
|    4667 |  4673 | You have more supply with high demand, and the prices will naturally flatten out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4667.0) |

|    4798 |  4800 | Hopefully.

|    4800 |  4809 | The opposition to this is based in – it's not based in fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4800.0) |
|    4809 |  4820 | So, you know, it's – I don't understand why there's so much opposition to this when we complain about high prices everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4809.0) |
|    4820 |  4824 | Well, not building more housing is not going to fix the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4820.0) |

|    4861 |  4868 | And I'm also one of those hypothetical people that moved to Knoxville for college and stayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4861.0) |
|    4868 |  4875 | And part of the reason I stayed was I bought a house and I decided to build my life here and my career here.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4868.0) |
|    4875 |  4883 | And that house is now worth – it's increased in value about six-fold from when I bought it nine years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4875.0) |

|    4895 |  4901 | Our values are double, triple, and we're constraining housing supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4895.0) |
|    4901 |  4906 | About three years ago, being a pandemic, I saved a historic fourplex from demolition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4901.0) |
|    4906 |  4909 | I had to go through the rezoning process as part of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4906.0) |
|    4909 |  4912 | A lot of you were part of that, helped me through that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4909.0) |
|    4912 |  4913 | I was very naive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4912.0) |
|    4913 |  4914 | I didn't know anything about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4913.0) |
|    4914 |  4919 | I went from RN2 to RN4, and that was just to return it to what it was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4914.0) |
|    4919 |  4922 | It was an abandoned structure that was going to get torn down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4919.0) |
|    4922 |  4929 | Now seven people live there where there would have been nobody living there before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4922.0) |
|    4929 |  4941 | So that led me to learn a lot about housing policy and related things like transportation and street design and land use.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4929.0) |
|    4941 |  4953 | I think that land use is at the foundation of making any policy changes in areas of concern that most of us in this room care about, right?                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4941.0) |
|    4953 |  4960 | Whether that's mental health or climate, environment, or transportation, education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4953.0) |
|    4960 |  4963 | But I think land use reform will help with all those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4960.0) |
|    4963 |  4973 | But I'd like to use my time to focus on one that is maybe not looked at as much, which is taxation, specifically taxation inequality.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4963.0) |
|    4973 |  4977 | So we know that our property taxes are not based on land use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4973.0) |
|    4977 |  4979 | That's what the rezoning is about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4977.0) |
|    4979 |  4982 | Please keep your remarks to this item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4979.0) |
|    4982 |  4983 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4982.0) |
|    4983 |  4992 | So we're rezoning from proposed rezoning from agriculture to RN2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4983.0) |
|    4992 |  4998 | If homes were built on that land, right, they would pay more taxes than the trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4992.0) |
|    4998 |  5014 | And I guess I'll skip ahead a couple points in that smaller lots with more houses proportionately pay more taxes than agricultural land or large tract suburban land, which is what a lot of people want to protect.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4998.0) |

|    5039 |  5061 | My point there is that it's not just the fiscally responsible thing to do, but it's also addressing an inequality between urban dwellers that proportionately pay more for public services than people who live on large tracts of land, even though directly that's not what our property taxes are based on. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5039.0) |

|    5817 |  5819 | The third reason has to do with flooding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5817.0) |

|    6576 |  6581 | and for a two-family lot it is 15,000 square feet in a RN1 zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6576.0) |
|    6581 |  6586 | So there can be single-family and duplex allowed in RN1 zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6581.0) |

|    6594 |  6599 | and for a duplex it would be 10,000 square feet, so it's just reduced in half.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6594.0) |
|    6599 |  6605 | So you would basically, between RN1 and RN2, you would get X amount,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6599.0) |

|    6612 |  6616 | but that's in gross figures is how it might work out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6612.0) |
|    6616 |  6623 | So in either RN1 or 2, duplexes are allowed, but that's not what we're doing today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6616.0) |
|    6623 |  6625 | There would be a special use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6623.0) |
|    6625 |  6627 | Yes, they would have to come back, special use,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6625.0) |
|    6627 |  6630 | and they'd have to come back with a concept plan through Planning Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6627.0) |
|    6630 |  6638 | to address all the drainage and traffic issues that Mr. Claybo was talking about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6630.0) |

|    6642 |  6649 | One of my big concerns has been, and you guys have heard me talk about the sidewalk on Francis Road so many times,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6642.0) |
|    6649 |  6655 | and I really, really want that because it is in a parental responsibility zone,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6649.0) |
|    6655 |  6658 | and I see the issues that are on Humboldt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6655.0) |
|    6658 |  6663 | I also see the issues that are going on with housing at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6658.0) |
|    6663 |  6671 | I want people to be safe, but I know that we need houses in such a bad way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6663.0) |

|    6683 |  6692 | I have a lot to say, so I might have to say a few things and then come back because I have multiple different points,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6683.0) |
|    6692 |  6702 | but just one thing that comes to mind, you know, I really want us as a city to commit to smart development as well,                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6692.0) |
|    6702 |  6716 | smart planning, and we do not seem to have, you know, a certain reasoning that we're following with these projects,                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6702.0) |

|    6724 |  6737 | it made me think of a development that we voted against on council that was going to be on the merchants, in the merchants area,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6724.0) |
|    6737 |  6746 | and, you know, at the time, the residents there wanted a park, wanted to see a park on that land,                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6737.0) |

|    6752 |  6754 | There are sidewalks, wide street.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6752.0) |
|    6754 |  6760 | There was an agreement to put a turning lane in, but that motion failed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6754.0) |
|    6760 |  6769 | and it was decided to work with the neighborhood on some sort of housing-slash-park solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6760.0) |
|    6769 |  6776 | In this situation, it doesn't seem like that conversation has happened at all,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6769.0) |
|    6776 |  6783 | and so I don't know when folks seem to be open to those types of conversations,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6776.0) |
|    6783 |  6791 | but, you know, the previous development that we opposed, I thought would have been great for affordable housing.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6783.0) |
|    6792 |  6797 | This development that, once I visited, the neighborhood does not compare at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6792.0) |
|    6801 |  6809 | The area is much less amenable to increasing the density than the other project that we voted against.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6801.0) |
|    6812 |  6818 | I'm also frustrated in terms of planning that this was not dealt with during recode,                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6812.0) |
|    6818 |  6830 | because I thought that we were supposed to be in a period where we've gone through a thorough review of our zoning policies,                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6818.0) |
|    6830 |  6834 | and we're no longer making these little spot changes everywhere,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6830.0) |
|    6834 |  6841 | but that is all we have been doing for a good amount of time now, rather than doing the planning that is needed,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6834.0) |
|    6842 |  6850 | and giving residents a heads-up on where we plan to invest as a city to improve the infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6842.0) |
|    6850 |  6856 | so that we can increase housing throughout the city that is absolutely needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6850.0) |
|    6857 |  6870 | So this is a frustrating issue for me, because I don't see the infrastructure in this area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6857.0) |
|    6870 |  6879 | and this area is very familiar to me, where I visited with some neighbors and told them,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6870.0) |
|    6880 |  6890 | I've seen the growth in this area, it was an area that my family looked at for several years as a place we were considering moving to,                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6880.0) |
|    6890 |  6895 | because there were new developments popping up all throughout that area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6890.0) |
|    6895 |  6899 | but as you drive into the neighborhood, it has a rural feel to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6895.0) |
|    6899 |  6907 | So I completely understand residents working to maintain the character of their neighborhood,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6899.0) |
|    6907 |  6912 | as we have had other neighbors come before us with the same intention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6907.0) |
|    6914 |  6918 | So I have a difficulty supporting this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6914.0) |
|    6918 |  6927 | In other situations, we've had more details, maybe it was a different part of the process, I don't remember exactly,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6918.0) |
|    6928 |  6937 | but I feel like we have voted against projects that have much more infrastructure in place than this area does.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6928.0) |
|    6937 |  6940 | I'll leave it at that for now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6937.0) |

|    6943 |  6945 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6943.0) |
|    6945 |  6957 | So question, if this were to pass, the developer would then go back to Planning Commission with their plans?                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6945.0) |
|    6957 |  6963 | Yes, they would have to develop a concept plan to be presented to planning staff,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6957.0) |
|    6963 |  6966 | a review by planning staff, engineering staff,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6963.0) |
|    6966 |  6975 | and then presented to Planning Commission for a public meeting and a review of that concept plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6966.0) |
|    6975 |  6984 | Okay, so would that be where the flood runoff mitigation, flood mitigation, traffic safety, access roads, sidewalks,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6975.0) |
|    6984 |  6988 | is that where that conversation would take place?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6984.0) |
|    6988 |  6993 | That is where those details would be discussed as far as access points,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6988.0) |
|    6993 |  7000 | how to address the safe access to and from it, stormwater management would all be addressed at that point in time                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6993.0) |
|    7000 |  7005 | based on the concept that they present, road layout and lot layouts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7000.0) |
|    7007 |  7013 | My next question, who would be responsible for stormwater management and some of these things we're talking about?                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7007.0) |
|    7013 |  7017 | I know city would be more than likely the sidewalks, but would that be on the developer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7013.0) |
|    7017 |  7023 | Is that something that the city would take care of?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7017.0) |
|    7023 |  7025 | Tom Klebel, engineering director.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7023.0) |
|    7025 |  7033 | So as far as the process, the engineering department would review those concept plans related to stormwater.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7025.0) |
|    7033 |  7040 | So if there's a detention or retention pond required for any of the stormwater facilities within that area,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7033.0) |
|    7040 |  7043 | we would review those at that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7040.0) |
|    7043 |  7044 | So but who builds it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7043.0) |
|    7044 |  7046 | Is that the developer or is that the city?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7044.0) |
|    7046 |  7047 | That would be the developer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7046.0) |

|    7097 |  7105 | This council did hear an attempt to rezone that under a different developer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7097.0) |
|    7105 |  7113 | It didn't pass here or it was actually downzoned here and after that the developer withdrew                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7105.0) |
|    7113 |  7117 | because he didn't get the high level that he wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7113.0) |
|    7117 |  7121 | Since then, a new developer has come in with a new plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7117.0) |
|    7121 |  7126 | and we've met with the neighborhoods and it's agreeable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7121.0) |
|    7126 |  7133 | and there will be density on Merchants Road but then the rest of it will be a park.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7126.0) |
|    7133 |  7141 | So what we had aspired to knock on wood is coming into place and that's just now coming up through the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7133.0) |
|    7141 |  7151 | So that worked out and this council was wise to not take that first attempt to rezone it by a different developer                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7141.0) |

|    7158 |  7160 | and I'm very optimistic about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7158.0) |

|    7163 |  7166 | I did have a couple of questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7163.0) |
|    7166 |  7169 | Just one from Mr. Welch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7166.0) |

|    7182 |  7184 | No, thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7182.0) |
|    7184 |  7195 | The 16.6 acres, how many dwelling units would be able to fit on that under RM1?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7184.0) |
|    7195 |  7204 | Just in gross numbers, you'd have to, yeah, without taking out land for roads and things like that so it's easily matched.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7195.0) |
|    7204 |  7211 | Under RM1s, there could be a 10,000 square foot lot so approximately 72 lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7204.0) |
|    7211 |  7220 | Gross, again, without, you'd have to subtract out maybe 20% to take account for roads and things of that nature and utilities.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7211.0) |
|    7220 |  7224 | But I'm just talking on the gross numbers, 72 lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7220.0) |
|    7224 |  7226 | I'm just trying to get ballpark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7224.0) |
|    7226 |  7227 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7226.0) |
|    7227 |  7228 | You haven't had time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7227.0) |
|    7228 |  7231 | And then under RM2, would it be roughly double that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7228.0) |
|    7231 |  7237 | RM2, if it was a single family lot, it would be 144 lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7231.0) |
|    7237 |  7239 | So, again, approximately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7237.0) |

|    7263 |  7277 | How many units is proposed under Mr. Huber's design so far or what's his kind of conception?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7263.0) |
|    7277 |  7285 | I know there's not a detailed plan, but what's the conception of how many units would be there under his plan?                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7277.0) |
|    7285 |  7295 | To answer your question, as I understand it, we don't have a plan as yet as to what we're going to build,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7285.0) |

|    7340 |  7346 | and we know the parameters of what we've got to deal with, we'll be looking at the property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7340.0) |

|    7355 |  7366 | The one thing I might mention, because I didn't hear it, and if it was said, I'm sorry,                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7355.0) |

|    7492 |  7494 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7492.0) |
|    7494 |  7500 | So, Mr. Welch, I guess the number you and I talked about was specific to the 14.78.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7494.0) |
|    7500 |  7511 | So if the total is 16.6, the number of allowable units for duplex under R and 2,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7500.0) |
|    7511 |  7516 | so a duplex lot has to be a minimum of 10,000 square feet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7511.0) |
|    7516 |  7518 | and you have two units per lot,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7516.0) |
|    7518 |  7522 | and you're a lot better at dividing acreage than me because I don't know how                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7518.0) |
|    7522 |  7524 | many whatevers per acre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7522.0) |
|    7524 |  7525 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7524.0) |

|    7700 |  7703 | I bring that up real quickly to address one of the points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7700.0) |
|    7703 |  7707 | Councilwoman Parker brought up is why wasn't this fixed in recode?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7703.0) |
|    7707 |  7711 | And the reason was is because no one wanted anything but R and 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7707.0) |

|    7891 |  7899 | I certainly understand the concerns, the safety, absolutely,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7891.0) |

|    7901 |  7908 | and also, again, going back to the fact that R and 5 now R and 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7901.0) |

|    8792 |  8797 | so the school is within that, of sidewalk down Francis,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8792.0) |
|    8797 |  8800 | and then the last 0.6-ish,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8797.0) |
|    8800 |  8804 | and again I'm using KGIS as my measuring tool so not perfect,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8800.0) |
|    8805 |  8813 | that is the 1.6 about miles, 1.5 miles from the school to the site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8805.0) |
|    8813 |  8818 | So about half of it, around about half of it is missing sidewalk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8813.0) |
|    8818 |  8821 | But it is identified, this entire area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8818.0) |

|    8843 |  8845 | approved and it goes to a concept plan,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8843.0) |
|    8845 |  8852 | how do you guys determine entrances and the requirements for that type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8845.0) |

|    9915 |  9916 | I just wanted to explain it to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9915.0) |
|    9916 |  9917 | But you're welcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9916.0) |
|    9917 |  9920 | And so we can just assume these are rhetorical questions or whatever,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9917.0) |
|    9920 |  9925 | and, you know, maybe something to mull over and think about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9920.0) |
|    9925 |  9926 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9925.0) |
|    9926 |  9929 | But that is it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9926.0) |
