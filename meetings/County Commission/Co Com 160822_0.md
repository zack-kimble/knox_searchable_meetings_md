| 0:15:38| I found myself complaining during the Black Wednesday process, talking about what's going on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=938)|
| 0:15:47| And I said, I can complain or I can try to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| And that really was my initial impetus to run for this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=950)|

| 0:17:19| You know, people come from all over this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1039)|

| 0:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Lots of times people ask me what it's like serving on Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and I can only tell them what it's been like for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| And it's been probably the most frustrating, challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| sometimes infuriating, but also absolutely delightful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| fun, worthwhile, and rewarding job I think I've ever had in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| And it's been a great honor and pleasure to serve with the Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| and with the other county employees and department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| They've made this job much easier in a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| because we have such great people working in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And I know that over the years I've often made you all talk about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| that you haven't been very comfortable talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| and debating issues that have been quite controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| But I think we've all been better for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| And I think it's probably a toss-up who's lost the most votes, Sam or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Because I know that I was on the losing end of quite a few votes over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| But I've really, really enjoyed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Sometimes it's felt like I've been serving as a den mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| to a rowdy group of Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| And sometimes it's felt like I've had ten older brothers looking out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And it's meant a lot to me and a lot to my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| that you've all been part of our lives for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| So it's been an honor to serve the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| And I look forward to still being involved at some point and in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| So you'll still be seeing me around, and I'll still be irritating you from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| But I like to think that you've enjoyed it a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| So thanks so much for this and for being such excellent colleagues over the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1423)|

| 0:28:12| First, I invited up here was my wife, and everybody knows you can't do what we do without the support of your family at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1692)|
| 0:28:23| They sacrifice a lot of days and nights, and they do it without money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| And they get to listen to our complaints when we get home about votes either going against or for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1709)|
| 0:28:37| although I was more on the winning side, Amy, than you and Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| I also have up here my successor, Commissioner-Elect Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| So that everybody can recognize him, I believe that he will do a good job, and I'm offering any guidance or help that you may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1730)|
| 0:29:00| I'll be glad to assist in any way possible, and I thank you for putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1740)|

| 0:29:16| I first want to thank the people of the 4th District of Knox County for allowing me to serve for the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| It has been my privilege and honor to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| In my six years on commission, I fought to try to keep Lakeshore open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| I knew if the hospital closed, it would mean more mentally ill people on the streets or in our jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| and that is exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| We need to build a safety center to take care of and help the mentally ill in our community get the services they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| I always felt that the role of government is to take care of the ones that cannot take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| To me, that would be the mentally ill, our seniors, children, and our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| I have spent my time on commission trying to help those that need most to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| I have fought for students, parents, teachers to give them a voice for better Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| I wasn't the leader of the movement, but was glad to help give that platform for them to speak from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| In the last six years, this commission and Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett increased the school's budget by over $76 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| while paying down the county's debt by over $90 million during the same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| We did this without raising taxes on the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| We also built two new schools, North Shore Elementary and Carter Elementary, paying cash for Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| We approved the building of two new middle schools, Hardin Valley and Gibbs, which will be completed in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| I approved the expansion of several others including Ball Camp Elementary and Pond Gap Elementary, also without raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1844)|
| 0:30:56| I have also worked hard in my district on such projects as the new guardrails on Linesman Drive, which we have needed for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1856)|
| 0:31:05| I proposed and helped pass a resolution updating the past ordinance, which mirrors the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| to take care of our four-legged friends, protecting them from extreme cold and extreme hot weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| In my six years on commission, I have answered every phone call or returned the call of every citizen who ever contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| Never asking where they lived because I felt I served the county, not just one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=1884)|

| 0:33:22| more independent thinking and not always along party lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| I felt not everything was right or left, Republican or Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2006)|

| 0:40:53| and I was born and raised in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2453)|

| 0:49:01| everything rises and falls on leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2941)|

| 0:49:10| And I would just urge you to continue to fight for our children and our parents and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| We read in the newspaper every day so many jobs are going away because of different technological advances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| and some of the lower skilled jobs just seem to diminish and go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| And it's going to be so important in the next 10 or 20 years that Knox County continues to raise the bar for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| And I know that the commission will continue to fight as hard as they can to raise that bar to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| So thank you for working together, each one of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| The law director, Mr. Armstrong, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I know he worked with us very well over the years sitting in on our board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=2987)|

| 0:50:09| And Karen's been the longest serving school board member now 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| In fact, I was just thinking a few minutes ago that I had two children in our Farragut schools at the same time you had your son there at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3016)|
| 0:50:26| And now they've all graduated, gone to college, graduated, and now gone to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| And she's still been serving the seven schools in our district as the school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| But we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| And we told her she's limited to just 10 minutes for an acceptance speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| Actually, they told me I had to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3045)|
| 0:50:58| So I will say in one way I am similar to Commissioner Brown in that we rarely pass up an opportunity to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3058)|
| 0:51:09| And what I will say is I've had the opportunity to serve a wonderful district in a tremendous county with terrific people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3069)|
| 0:51:19| And it has certainly been an honor and a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I thank you all for your support over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3082)|

| 0:52:22| I don't know how to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| It would be three from the 8th District that went astray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| We could be three blind mice, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Or we could be any of the other threes of things that you can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3153)|

| 0:58:15| that put me in the situation where I ended up serving on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| and time passes and now I'm your law director, so he's not going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| but when in doubt, if I do something wrong, you've just got to blame Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| So anyway, Phil's been a dear friend, and as they said, an 8th District boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| we got rid of the Gibbs Eagle now, it's just the Carter Hornets that are standing down here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| and we're pleased to say that one Carter Hornet is leaving from the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| and another Carter Hornet is now going to be the incoming property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| so the 8th District will still be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| And Phil, I'm going to turn this over to you, and I appreciate your friendship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| and the work you've done and the opportunities and things you've done for the citizens of all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3541)|
| 0:59:13| Well, I'd like to thank this body today for being honored in such a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| As I look up there, a lot of you are not going to have the opportunity to serve as I did on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| I have to sort of smile and giggle about it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| but I served with 40 commissioners, either elected or appointed, and I don't hold the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| So you think that you know troubled times, but maybe you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| But what I have seen is a cleansing and purging until we've got it down to 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| and such a great process with great people that have served since me and with me and now serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| So I'll say that about commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Property assessor, I'm not sure that I got any smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I come in during the time of, and a lot of people don't think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| roughest time of economic upheaval, especially in the real estate market since the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| Now, you walk in off the street after two years of being on commission, you're faced with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Had a lot of help from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| We didn't have the most number of appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| but we had a substantial number of appeals that no property assessor in Knox County had faced before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We had over 16,500 informal appeals, 4,500 board of equalization appeals, and about 2,200 appeals to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3631)|
| 1:00:42| Roughly, that was a downturn of $170 million in assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| And that's not a crippling blow to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| But how were we able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| Well, when you stand here at the podium, lots of times you're honoring me, but you're honoring my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| I had a great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| My top three people had 110 years' experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Two guys, Dean Lewis and Jim Weaver, had almost 80 years when they came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| Linda Turner was recommended by the Realty Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| She had 30, 35 years broker, was a residential appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| She also handled First Tennessee's foreclosures for 48 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| So you see what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| I balanced mass appraisal against real estate because it's two separate concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| And my greatest ally was change, and my greatest adversary was change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| I came into a computer system that hadn't been changed in two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| Mike Hammond, I don't know if he's in the room here, in October of 9, he allowed me, Amy, I believe, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| October of 9 allowed me to put computers and telephones on the appraiser's desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| We don't talk about the computer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Let's just talk about putting telephones on the appraiser's desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| They went from a measured listener quota system to now they're appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| They've got dual screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| They're accountable for the entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| They don't turn it over to data people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| It's never been to your property and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Part of this, when I say my staff, and I know Dick Moran's out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| he's been very patient with me because sometimes I've been very demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| And Carrie and Dave, that's headed that up, had a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| You don't understand what it is to change over a system like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| Probably a million pieces of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| And after you get it going up and running, you have to test 2,000 at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| There is a little criticism here not too long ago about the conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| I want to tell you something to make it simple for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| If you have a quarter, two diamonds, and a nickel in this hand or this pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| and you take that same quarter, two nickels and a dime in this pocket and put it over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| put it in this pocket, that's the conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| His department, the IT department, converted it perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| You can't change that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| And I want to clear that up and say what a great job that staff was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| because that was a two-year conversion process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| And it took a lot of talent to do that because we went from a program that was going dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| Now 600 counties has the same computer system, and it's a valuable tool, and it's supported well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3810)|
| 1:03:39| Education, that was a highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| The state said, hey, if you put people in class, we'll bring you to classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| Part of the reason I did that, Nashville had mid-20s of certified appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| Memphis had 30-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| We had none except what I hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| Now we're on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| We've got a lot taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I had three or four take the master test here just lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| And we're well on schedule and having a good, trained staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| And I will throw out just a few numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| If you serve two terms, we're the office that generates almost $1.9 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| In the first few years that I served, new business growth in Knox County was between $100 million and $150 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| Last year it was $400 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Great news for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| You'll probably see the state comes in two years after your reappraisal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| They measure and recalculate your sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| You're probably going to see anywhere between a 4% to a 10% drop in the property rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| Now, that doesn't mean any lost income due to equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| Matter of fact, probably people will pay a fair amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| Our discovery program has aided in the discovery of new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| So I could talk a lot up here, but it's just not me that sort of headed up this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| It's my staff with experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| So we're turning over a good staff and a good office to Mr. Pinehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| And we look forward to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| We hope that he's successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| And certainly we'll offer our help in any way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| If I didn't introduce my wife, Cindy, and my granddaughter, Bria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| I want to correct that before I get away from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3927)|
| 1:05:35| Madam Clerk, I request that you turn to page 20 and read the presentation caption at the top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| Presentation of the East Tennessee Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration, ASPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3942)|

| 1:06:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| I request the presence of Mr. Caldwell, the Honorable Mayor of Knox County, Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| and introduce the former law director of Knox County, Dr. Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3971)|
| 1:06:26| Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, and for the record, I'm Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| I'm on the faculty of the University of Tennessee School of Public Policy and Administration and Political Science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| But I'm here today as the past president, as a member of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| of the East Tennessee Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration, also known as ASPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| ASPA is a national organization dedicated to the ethical and professional practice of public administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| Annually, we submit to our members basically nominees for our Public Administrator of the Year Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| And I'm delighted to tell you that this year's award recipient is someone for whom I have great respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| because I was afforded the opportunity to work with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| someone who is currently serving you and has served diligently in Knox County through its trials and travails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| especially when it comes to matters of fiscal finance and accountability, and that is Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| We do have a plaque for Chris, and if I could just briefly read this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| it is our 2016 Public Administrator of the Year Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| This award is made in recognition of Mr. Caldwell's ethical and professional contributions to the practice of public administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| which have improved our society and inspired others to pursue careers in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Caldwell should say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4056)|
| 1:08:04| I'm honored for this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| I just wanted to really tell you it's nothing really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| I couldn't do what I do without the great staff at the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| They do great work and make my job very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| And, you know, once again, you all have heard enough speaking, so I'm just honored to have received this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4110)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Dr. Jarrett, I appreciate the acknowledgement of Knox County and your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| and I'd also like to thank you for the service that you have also given Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| Well, thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| And, of course, serving Knox County to me was every bit as precious as my military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| It was a distinct honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Mr. Mayor, while you're remaining at the podium there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| the portion of the agenda that we're now moving into is public forum, and you are the first person on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| Mr. Chairman, members, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| As all of you know, the East Tennessee Technology Access Center, that's pretty neat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| they do some very good work for the people in our community with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| They're currently working to expand their efforts to include a community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4178)|

| 1:09:46| It's not going to be cheap to make it happen, but I think we can help get it started right here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| So I'm committing $500 for my campaign account for the planned community center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| and I want to challenge each of you to match my contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| either through your own campaign accounts or through your discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| I met with Executive Director Mary Tom Adams and heard her pitch last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| and I think it's a pretty good pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| It's a very good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Now, I want her to come up maybe and tell you a little bit about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| Would that be all right, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| I'll let her tell you exactly what they do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| They really do the Lord's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| They look after folks that maybe some of us would think that fate wasn't as kind to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| and make accessibility the forefront of what they do, and they just do wonderful, wonderful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| I was familiar with them when I was in the legislature and tried to help them out then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| and I think this would be a very good project for us to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| Could I have your name and address for the record, please, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Yes, Mary Tom Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| I live at 4415 West Sunset Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you, Mayor Burchett, for your support of the East Tennessee Technology Access Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| I've got two wonderful stories to tell you of people who are overcoming challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| that were fairly substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| One is a little girl named Phoebe who was born to a mother who was addicted to opiates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| She was given very little chance of speaking or walking or having any kind of a fun life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| but Phoebe was fortunate enough to be adopted into a home that sees no disability too great to overcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| and the East Tennessee Technology Access Center got her started with a very small rollator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| which is like a walker with wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Now, Phoebe's rollator is about this tall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| and we give away durable medical equipment to people who either don't have insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| or for whom insurance is not going to cover something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| A tiny little rollator is a very expensive piece of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| and we were able to help Phoebe get this equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and as she grows, we will continue to help her get the next rollator that she may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| or that she may never need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Phoebe is a tiny little pigtailed girl who, at this point in her life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| is about to do away with that rollator because she has a great family that's supporting her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| and she's about to speak, and her mother told me recently that she thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| that she'll return the rollator for the next little girl or boy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Now, sometimes we have people who come into our center who have lost the ability to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| Joel is a man who is in his mid-50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| and he had an automobile accident about five years ago that left him paralyzed from the chest down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| So Joel had watched enough NCIS, as he said, and needed to figure out what was next for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| So he decided to enroll in the University of Tennessee's Vocational Rehabilitation Master's Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| Well, Joel didn't really know anything about computers, and his hand doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| So when he went to use the mouse, he couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| And when he went to try to type, obviously, if your fingers don't work, you can't type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| So Joel came to the East Tennessee Technology Access Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| and we were able to give him a mouse that rolls, and he could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| We also provided him Dragon Recognition software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| So he was able to complete his master's degree and will be coming to work at ETAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| A community center is a place where people get to come and be exactly who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| We need this at ETAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| We can do martial arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| We can do yoga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| We can do community gardening, all things for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| We have two acres in South Knoxville and a very large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Your support will help us do that, and we are very grateful for that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| Continuing with public forum, Brenda Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| Brenda Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| Continuing with public forum, Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| My name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| Last month, I was up here, and I showed you all this racist picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| with Muhammad Ali and the gorilla on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| And right after the meeting, the mayor and his staff, they were back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| I said, can you find Muhammad Ali on this picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| He couldn't even find Muhammad Ali on this picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| It was so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| But you gave the gorilla Section E and Section F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| and the front page of the Sunday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| I'll be here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| You can put my name down now until something changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| And to prove how racist it is, last month this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| And what happened this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I had the most racist thing I ever had happen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| I should have been one of them black victims from a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| You had a Knox County Sheriff officer stop in front of an intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| on 16th and Laurel Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| And what did she do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| She put her unmarked car in park, jumped out of her vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| and ran to my vehicle behind her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| And she harassed me and threatened me like my life was in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I called the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I called the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| I called the Knoxville FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I called the White House, and they transferred me to the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| And I called the Office of Poor Standards for the Knox County Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| and they said they would have her supervisor talk to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| I called back a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| They said they don't even have an officer fit the description I gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| That tells me right there they are covering up something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| It got to the point to where I had to go to John Duncan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| I went to Corker's office, and I went to Lamar Alexander last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| and I had them fax papers to get an investigation going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| So this four-year-old party, they'll be coming to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| And I called the FBI again to try to get some kind of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| as to why this can't be investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Finally, I got to the district attorney's office today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| and they were willing to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| If this lady harassed me and road-raged me, either she did it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| or she will do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| We need to find this person and just let her answer to why did she do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I never had high blood pressure in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| And just telling this story to the FBI, telling it to the governor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| and everyone else, my blood pressure just shoot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| This should not have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| We should not have to be in the paper for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| But as far as this Muhammad Ali thing, until somebody gets to the news center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| and let them know, it's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| It's not even called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| We went to the Muhammad Ali funeral in a China TV station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| They interviewed us, and they was glad to put this out in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| The Associated Press ran an article on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| Sports Illustrated ran an article on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| ESPN did a live shot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| It's just that if we're going to do something, let's be for real about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| We've got to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| We've got to live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| But for this racist officer to do what she did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| and the office say they don't have this person on their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| and then they go further to say, well, if it happened to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| can I file charges on somebody impersonating a police officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| They still didn't want to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| It's only until I got to the Department of Justice now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| and the district attorney here, they're willing to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| But at the same time, Sam, you're still a bad referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| You're one of the worst we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| And for Amy, please run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| We will give you all our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| And that is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| And on the last thing, your boy Peyton Manning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| he donated $10 million to Donald Trump's campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| And his dad, Archie Manning, told the Trump campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| if you need some more money, we'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| And in conclusion, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| In spite of Mr. Presley's dementia, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| he has about my officiating abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| I do want to agree with him in that he wasn't the only one aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| news sitting article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| I don't think this is the body to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| But that was an atrocity that Representative Daniel's statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| just compounded and really makes the region look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| It was unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| It wasn't appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Neither one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| And so, you know, Xavier and I have a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| I did just say that that was one of my funniest moments on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| when he threw a flag at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| But it really is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| And I don't think a lot of thought went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Because I think the news generally does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| But that was just horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| So I wasn't here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| But I did want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| And in conclusion of public forum is the Honorable Sheriff J.J. Jones here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| He doesn't know why he's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| But he's going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| The St. Jude's is not on our agenda, so you'll have to explain what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| The what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| The St. Jude's is not on our agenda, so you'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| It's not on there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| Take the five minutes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Take the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4822)|
| 1:20:33| I'm Jerry Flater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I'm from Kingsport, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| You've got me up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| It says, Ride for Kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| So that's kind of close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| This is something we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| And I'll give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| I belong to a group, the Kingsport chapter of the Gold Wing Road Riders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| There's chapters all over the world, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Why they call it Road Riders, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Nobody's going to take a gold wing off the road, at least on purpose anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| But our sole objective for several years, this is our 21st year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| we raise money specifically for St. Jude's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| We have projects all through the year that we raise money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| And this has been established, like I said, this will be our 21st year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| We gather up at Bristol with our chapter and several other chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| We have chapters out of North Carolina, Virginia, and on our ride to Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| and it's called Wings Across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| We pick up other chapters, other groups, other individuals that ride with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| and we go every year and present what money the different chapters have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| every year to St. Jude Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| We have been involved with it for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| I'm the ride coordinator, and this is part of the responsibility that I take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| But I believe it was last year or the year before last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| we reached the million-dollar mark of what we have done over these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| which in itself sounds like quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| But we have been told it's a million point six a day to operate that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| So it is a very expensive operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| But we've also been told when Danny Thomas started it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| they had a 4% survival rate of these children, and now they're above 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| So there's a lot of great causes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| This just happens to be one that we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| But we've come down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| We felt it was important enough to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| We're from Kingsport, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| But part of our ride involves coming through Knoxville, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| We avoid the interstates where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| We like to ride the back roads and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| But coming through Knoxville, plus we also stop at your McGee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| which is a very nice park, by the way, for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| And we take a break and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| And we have grown to the point now, when we leave Bristol, we have 40, 50, 60 bikes riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| By the time we get to Memphis, it's double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| But four or five motorcycles going down the road is not too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| But 50, 60 is kind of a challenge to get through somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| The Knox County Sheriff's Department has been very, very instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| in getting us through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| They've helped us get through here for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| It's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| It makes it safe for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| We wanted to come thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| We were going to do this at the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| But I know we're kind of preaching to the choir here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| You know the department you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| But we wanted to say thank you to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| and to thank you for supporting the motorcycle division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| They look like they're having a ball when they're escorting us through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| but we know they're very professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| They put on a tremendous appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| They represent the Sheriff's Department very well, which represents you very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| So they do a tremendous job for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| and I'm sure other escorts that they are involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| But it was significant enough for us to come through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| or come down here this evening to tell you all what they do for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| to allow us to continue the fundraising that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And we wanted to present this to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| So if the sheriff and at least the lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| but that's why they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| They're not to run us out of town when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Richard, you all come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| This is Richard and Connie Pendleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| He's the chapter director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Nelda is my wife and part-time GPS when we get lost on the motorcycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| So she tells me where I need to stop and ask for directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| This is the Gold Wing Tennessee Chapter C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| presents Knox County Sheriff's Department Tango Shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| for their past, present, and future dedication and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| to our Wings Across Tennessee project for funding St. Jude Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| And this is just a very small thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It is tremendous what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| You've probably seen them out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| but it's unbelievable the way they function as an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| as far as a division of the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| And we just wanted to come down here and say thank you to them in your all's presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5117)|
| 1:25:39| Just to add to that, I know they do a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| but it's always good to hear from somebody else also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| Sam, the jail just called up here and said they're missing a bunch of bags of potato chips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| I've got a detective en route for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Let me restate what is obvious to Mr. Fleener and the Ride for Kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5158)|
| 1:26:06| The Wings Across Tennessee or Ride for Kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| any of the number of things that you're invested heavily in with your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5172)|
| 1:26:21| cannot be outweighed by the fact that what you're doing supports the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| that have no other means to receive the treatment at St. Jude's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| I know their advertisement says the families have no out-of-pocket expense going to St. Jude's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5192)|
| 1:26:41| and it's through people like you and the honorable, dedicated men of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| raising money to support that, and we, County Commission, truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| Thank you, sir, for coming to be with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5214)|
| 1:27:05| And now through all my sticky notes and through everything that we've done this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| I would ask to have a motion for approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5230)|

| 1:27:29| We are now to amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| Is there anything on our agenda this evening that anyone would like to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| other than those which are not asterisked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| I'll make a motion the agenda be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5266)|

| 1:27:59| There are no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=5279)|

| 1:43:40| Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| Madam Clerk, I believe the next item is page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| Yes, page 4, Resolution 8112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| It is appointing an individual to complete the unfulfilled term of Jim Jennings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| as the alternate member on the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| which term expires April 30, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| On Tuesday, August 16, at 3.22 p.m., an email authored by Ms. Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6248)|
| 1:44:19| informed us that Cliff Beeler had withdrawn his name from consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| leaving only one resume attached to the resolution, that being for Mr. Jim Wright, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| Is Mr. Jim Wright here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Mr. Beeler, would you please come to the podium, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Can I go ahead and make the motion, or do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| I'd like to make the motion he's been nominated by acclamation and voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Mr. Wright, the reason I've called you down here is because we resemble each other in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6288)|
| 1:44:56| but we are of no relation. I do not know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| That's one thing I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Do you wish to say anything in addressing commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| on consideration to be a member of the County Sheriff's Merit Review Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| You'll be the alternate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| I'd just like to say I'm honored and humbled to even be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| It's a privilege to be able to serve on the Sheriff's Merit Council, or to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6320)|

| 1:45:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6338)|

| 1:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6354)|

| 1:46:38| Okay, it's on page 19, the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6398)|

| 1:48:06| This is Ordinance O-16-8-101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| Did you read those again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| I think I missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| I just have a question once the motion is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| I'll make a motion to approve so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I guess the question is for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| and I think one of his staff or Mark may, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| I guess the main thing that I saw the difference was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| in this employee handbook, and I just want to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| Is the right for an employee to appeal, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| is really leaving the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| And so what does that do, and why are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| My name is Myers Morton, 847 Knight Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| I'm deputy law director at the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| Normally, Tennessee law provides that employees can be employees at will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| and that includes public employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Knox County employees are employees at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| However, if there's a civil service board, which there is for sheriff's deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| they're not employees at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| They're entitled to rights under the civil service board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| Absent that, there are some Tennessee Court of Appeals cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| that indicate at times an employee's manual can provide a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| with certain contractual rights, including the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| And sometimes it can be considered if an employee or an employee's manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| gives the right to appeal a termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| a court has under certain circumstances discretion to say they have rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| they have contract rights, and they're no longer employees at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| Now, our employee's manual has disclaimers saying that we can amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| saying that it's entirely discretionary, but it's a very gray area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| and a court could decide ultimately that it granted a Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| the right, contractual rights, and they're no longer employees at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Okay, so under the example, I mean, sheriff's offices, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| the sworn is obviously not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| So let's say employee A is working at an entry level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| or not mid-level management, somewhere in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| and they volunteer in a political campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| They lose, and their person loses, and they're not the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| I understand directors aren't protected and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| but that lower level employee gets fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| What protections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| I mean, a political firing shouldn't be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| Is this outside the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| No, this is just in general government, what we have control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| Employees at will can be fired for any reason or no reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| but they cannot be fired for an illegal reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| I'm not sure, but if an employee is fired for free speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| they would have a civil rights action that they could proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| irrespective of this employee's manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Well, I just wanted to bring it up because it's different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| contrary to what we've been doing for the time I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| and so I want to make sure that we're not creating an environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| where we can just get rid of somebody if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| The supervisor is still responsible for making the appropriate decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| and I think the mayor ultimately has final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Are fee offices covered under this, Mr. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| Yes, sir, except for, you said fee offices, the elected officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| Yes, well, registered aides, clerks, all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Unless they adopt their own policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| They're going to fall under ours unless they have their own employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Affirmatively, yes, and there's a procedure set out that they have to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| within a certain period of time after council decides whether or not to have a new manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Seeing no further discussion, this ordinance first reading is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6743)|

| 1:54:07| Pardon me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Let me say this, that there are all elected elects are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6848)|
| 1:54:18| I thank Ms. Gill, Ms. Carringer, Mr. Nystrom, and Mr. Daley for taking the time to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6858)|
| 1:54:27| I know that they've been here before, but especially tonight to be here with us and sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| coming on board as commissioners here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Discussion regarding the safety center committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| This discussion item is added, the reason being that there is some change of titles in the people that make up this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6886)|
| 1:54:59| As in Commissioner Brown is Commissioner Brown this evening, and maybe the next time that committee were to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| he would not be Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| I would like to defer to new commission, but it's going to be my recommendation that that committee remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6909)|
| 1:55:17| It is currently made up for its 12-month life cycle as appointed by the sitting current chair of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6917)|
| 1:55:28| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| That's pretty much what I was going to ask, if I could remain on that committee until this duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| And, again, it would be my recommendation to the new commission, seated upcoming Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6937)|
| 1:55:52| Just grab one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| The RFP is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| It just got back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| It has not been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| I talked to the mayor, I talked to Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| and the suggestion is that on that safety committee we had representatives from 9 out of 10 of the service organizations in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6967)|
| 1:56:21| that handle these types of clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| After the committee from purchasing goes through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| the suggestion is that it go to a special meeting of the safety committee for further vetting and nitpicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=6995)|
| 1:56:46| I don't want to say nitpicking, but, you know, approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Maybe it needs to be tweaked, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Nobody has seen anything on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| But go to the safety committee, who would then make a recommendation back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7014)|
| 1:57:05| And at that point, if I look back in a minute, I'm sure that Ms. Angie would agree that we had agreed somewhere along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7025)|
| 1:57:14| to have a workshop before the commission vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| That's kind of where we are at this point, assuming everybody is in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| Seeing no further discussion and moving on into announcements, the TVA&I Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| the Tennessee Valley Industrial Agricultural Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| has invited us commissioners to their annual fair lunch September the 9th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7057)|
| 1:57:46| It would also mean that the commissioners elect are also invited to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| There's something down here bothering me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| Something had been nudging my shin there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7083)|
| 1:58:12| Okay, back to the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| The Fair Board has invited Knox County commissioners to their annual lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| That's September the 9th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| Also, the regional meeting of the Tennessee Commissioners Association will be here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| Calhoun is on the river, August the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| For either of those, no, wait a minute, I've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7115)|
| 1:58:43| It's a pink note, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| The annual conference, Tennessee Commissioners Association will be in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| It's their conference and trade show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| It's October 12th and 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| If you're going to Calhoun's on the river for the evening meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| or if you're going to the trade show conference in October 12th and 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| please notify the commission office so that we can get a head count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| and begin to get those reservations made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| And the last thing that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Six o'clock for Calhoun's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| Yes, six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| Six o'clock, no, six o'clock, August the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| The last item I have is at the swearing in of Knox County Commission elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7169)|
| 1:59:39| and the Board of Education, I think, also is being hosted by the Honorable Mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| That will be September 1st at 9 a.m. in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| And then I've been handed one late addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| The third annual Asian Festival will be on Market Square, 11 to 6, 11a to 6p, Sunday, August the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7194)|
| 2:00:06| That's the third annual Asian Festival, Market Square, Sunday, August the 28th, 11a to 6p.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7206)|
| 2:00:17| Are there other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7217)|
| 2:00:25| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Yeah, this week, two things in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| It's Wednesday the 24th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| The county is going to break ground on Plum Creek Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| So we'll be there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| There should be an e-mail out for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| And also Thursday the 25th at 245, we've already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| The Carnes Lions Club is breaking ground on their park, a great addition by a community club in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| So we want to give them credit where credit is due, and they've done a great job on their property for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7250)|
| 2:00:57| So that's the 25th at 245, and it's behind the fire department and Bojangles there on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| Commissioner Brown, you have seniority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| I see more lights on this side now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| I just want to make a quick announcement that our merchants south of the river are going to be starting back their second Saturday sales in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7273)|
| 2:01:25| So I want to remind everybody out there to come south and shop the second Saturday in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7285)|
| 2:01:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| The Metropolitan Planning Commission tomorrow, August the 23rd from 5 to 8 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| at the North Shore Elementary School is going to be doing an update on the Southwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| and Commissioner-elect Nystrom is going to be in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| But I also want to make the offer to any of the other new commissioners that if they're not familiar with how a sector plan is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7316)|
| 2:02:04| the paperwork and maps and everything will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| It's going to be an open house concept, so you can come and go as you please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| and that's from 5 to 8 tomorrow at the North Shore Elementary School in the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| And moving right down the line, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| I don't know if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| When I was downstairs, somebody put these lovely, fragrant lilies here for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| and Sam said that it was Dan Andrews who put these here for me, and I wanted to thank him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7351)|
| 2:02:37| It was incredibly thoughtful, and I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| So I don't know if he's still here or not, but thank you, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| You know, as we issue these thank yous, I think a little bit of explanation is in order for all of these bags of chips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| which I sincerely thank all the participants for delivering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| You know, it's been eight and a half years, and when I say we eat jail food up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| we generally do eat food that is for the prisoners downstairs at the gracious efforts of our sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7386)|
| 2:03:15| But, you know, past eight and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| I probably consumed a bit more chips than the average commissioner and staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| so it didn't go unnoticed by my partner here, Amy, and she got me on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| So thank you all for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| But I thought it needed to be explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| I don't know for whatever reason, whether it's the Olympics or the presidential cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| but the historic flooding that's going on in Louisiana has really been undersold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| and made recognized to the people of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| So I'm just asking the people of Knox County to pray for these people and help out in any way you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| Seeing no further lights, now do not become alarmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7439)|

| 2:04:37| The portion of the meeting related to zoning requests, we call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7477)|

| 2:04:53| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| On 4P16RZ, which is the first item, and I know it's been reset, they've had a seller that's backed out on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| and he would like to ask if we would table that until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| And I told him that that would be his last reset if we got voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| If it's deferred until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| Deferred, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| I wanted to get the correct terminology there because one's a different vote number than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| So I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| On the first item, 4P16RZ, be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| This is the last time until the next meeting of the Board of Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| October, next October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| Yeah, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| And this is the same one that's been deferred since May the 23rd of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| And the stipulation here is that we will not defer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| I mean, we can do whatever we want to, but I thought it would be the last time I asked for a deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| Oh, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| It's the action of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| Motion is properly before us to defer with the stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| This will be the last deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7583)|

| 2:07:06| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Seeing no opposition, report of MPC, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| The Planning Commission voted 14-0 to recommend to you plan residential at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| One person spoke in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| The majority of the correspondence that we had on the matter recommended the four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7643)|
| 2:07:33| Do you wish to speak to address zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| We had no problem with the four units per acre, and at MPC I suggested that they go ahead and approve it at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7659)|
| 2:07:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| Before I make the motion, in talking with the developer, I think Gary can confirm this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7673)|
| 2:08:02| but I believe you're going to come in somewhere closer to three and a half, aren't you, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| Is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| I really haven't done a layout yet, so it's probably going to be in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| Well, our concern in the community was that the one right next to it came in at 3.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7693)|
| 2:08:21| so we wanted to stay close to the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| Based on that, I'll move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| Per MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7708)|

| 2:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Okay, seeing no further discussion, the motion that is before us is to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7715)|

| 2:10:57| Page 22, item 6-A-16-SP is a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the 2016 Northwest County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7857)|
| 2:11:07| Commission Districts 3, 4, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| This is presented by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| Yes, Commissioners, this is the Northwest County Sector Plan, the first time it's been updated since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7878)|
| 2:11:26| Issues that have been addressed, there have been a number of mixed-use areas that have been added to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| specifically in the Pellissippi Parkway area, the area around the Carnes, downtown Carnes, if you want to call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7893)|
| 2:11:41| There was some emphasis in that area, along with the area along the new Shaw Grove ball camp corridor down that valley through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7901)|
| 2:11:57| With regard to the hillside information, the hillside protection is no longer a plan category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7917)|
| 2:12:08| It is now an overlay on the plan, and each piece of property has a plan designation underneath the hillside protection notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7928)|
| 2:12:21| No longer will we struggle with what to recommend for rezoning on the areas that are designated for hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7941)|
| 2:12:36| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Yes, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Mr. Kelly, I really want to say, first of all, to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| I know Liz is not, I don't think she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| She's not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| But, you know, this is the first time I've had to deal with her on a major project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| and she was outstanding in her public awareness, I guess, her marketing of this, everything that she did to include the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7971)|
| 2:13:01| She did a great job, and I'd like for you to tell her and Mr. Green that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| In regard to your previous comment, the overlay on the hillside, is it still as it was written into the plan as a suggestion onto those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| The hillside plan is a guide, and when we review applications that are designated for slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=7994)|
| 2:13:24| it does have an impact typically on what the staff will recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| Whereas the Planning Commission and you as elected officials have the authority to use the information that we put before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| and still act in any way you deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| And again, tell Mr. Green and Ms. Liz that she did an outstanding job on social media and everything, getting everybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8019)|
| 2:13:46| So thank you, and I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| Seeing no further discussion, the motion before us is to approve, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8031)|

| 2:15:00| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8100)|

| 2:15:10| It's an appeal from denial of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| I jokingly understand where we are on this, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8115)|

| 2:15:35| And with that, the report of MPC, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| Yes, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Walker Trucking applied for C.B. zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| The current zoning of the property is planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| They applied for C.B. zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| The staff, in making their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| did recommend approval of a portion of the property being rezoned to C.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Once the matter got before the Planning Commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| there was discussion among the Planning Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| at which point they opted to deny the request after hearing, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| the use that is proposed is permitted in the planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| the current zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| There was a lot of discussion about the access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| There was discussion about screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| There was discussion about other items dealing with the development of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| property for the proposed use, which is a mulch yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| After hearing these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| the Planning Commission voted to deny the C.B. zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| because through the current planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| they could, through the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| come before the Planning Commission, ask for the use to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| At that point, the Planning Commission could weigh in on access, screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| and the other what might be considered offensive parts of the business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| operate and could deal with those in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8223)|
| 2:17:10| Before I start, I need to pass out some material to commission members, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| and then I'll start after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| While he's passing that out, do you all have a map that has a green line across it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| or do you have any colored maps of any kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| It's online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| Is it in the packet, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| In the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| What I've got in the packet is not colored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| No, you're not going down far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Go down to page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| If you don't have the one that has the green line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| the staff recommendation doesn't make a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| Yeah, it is page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| It's a red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| Well, there's a green line on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| There's one with a red line and one with a green line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| There's one page 8 is a green line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| We have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8288)|
| 2:18:23| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8303)|
| 2:18:30| First, let me say how appropriate it is for the four members who are going off this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8310)|
| 2:18:40| to have as their last item to deal with on the last meeting they're going to be here in this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8320)|
| 2:18:50| and have to deal with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| I compliment you all on your period of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| and personally add my thanks to the thanks of others in the county for your period of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8340)|
| 2:19:07| I probably talked to those of you who are going off and expressed my feelings in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8347)|
| 2:19:16| Let me say that there was a lot of time spent and work on this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8356)|
| 2:19:28| And if you'll look at the one I just passed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| you have essentially one rather darker orange line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8374)|
| 2:19:43| and then two very faint lines below or to the east and south of that darker shaded orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8383)|
| 2:20:00| In any event, the lower, the one closest to the bottom of the property of those faint orange lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8400)|
| 2:20:06| was our first position as to what we wanted rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| When there were problems with that and working with the staff member on this, Mike, what's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8413)|
| 2:20:23| Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| We went back and did some more work and came up with then the next one to the bottom line as our suggested line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8425)|
| 2:20:35| We went out to the site and he accompanied us, looked at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| told him what we were talking about doing and how we proposed to include this into our mulching operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8440)|
| 2:20:50| which is that property immediately to the east of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| And while out there we did a lot of looking and thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| and the line that you now have as the supposed green line is actually, I believe on your stuff, a red or an orange line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8461)|
| 2:21:12| It goes diagonally across the property from the upper right-hand corner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8472)|
| 2:21:20| down to where there's a, on the other side of the property, where there's sort of a jog and it attaches in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8480)|
| 2:21:28| That is the line that we all agreed to and that we would not do anything above that line or to the north of that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8488)|
| 2:21:41| Mr. King, that's the line that's designated 1040?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| That's the one we ultimately agreed on and everything north of that line will remain PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8509)|
| 2:21:58| and remain in woods as you see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| And only on the south side are we going to be doing our operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8523)|
| 2:22:10| It is a commercial mulching facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| It is an important adjunct or an important addition to our operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| We have used the property next door and will continue to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8539)|
| 2:22:27| but this expansion gives us the capability for spreading out some of that operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| and using this adjoining property for further storage area for mulch material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| that is, if you will, seasoned in windrows and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| And down at the front portion of the property closest to Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| we'll probably be moving our retail sale of mulch material, sand and gravel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8571)|
| 2:22:59| and that sort of stuff from the other site to put it onto this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8579)|
| 2:23:07| We bid just recently the city contract for yard waste disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| We got the approval from city council at its last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| This will serve importantly in delivering that service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8599)|
| 2:23:26| We will have a central city site used like a transfer station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| Material will come in there, be lightly processed like ground one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| and then goes out to this site on Rutledge Pike or our other facility out in Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| where the additional grinding and storage of material will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| Now, there are two things that I want to talk about that I think bear most on the question of our requested approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8629)|
| 2:24:04| The first is the suggestion, and that was one of the things mentioned by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| or perhaps more of the MPC members, is that we could do what we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| if we put a development plan in and went through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| We could do that in the PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| We didn't have to have it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| While that is true, CB gives us a lot more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| Right now, we've got a grinder over here on the property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| We've got scales over there and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| The time may come in the future when we want to use that grinder on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8684)|
| 2:24:51| that's here before you today and set up a location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| Have to put in a little bit different network of roadway to service stuff coming out of that grinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8696)|
| 2:25:03| If we did that, we'd end up having to go back in all probability and get another plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8703)|
| 2:25:11| and submit it and get it reviewed and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| There are other things about it that it's just a lot less cumbersome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| from a getting the job done standpoint for us to have it as CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8721)|
| 2:25:31| The last point I would say on that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| If I go and it's PC and I go and I submit a plan and MPC doesn't approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| my appeal is to the county BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| I would rather have the action of this body, in essence, approving our proposed utilization of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8746)|
| 2:25:55| and this is the way you can do it by giving us the CB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| Now, the only other thing is there hasn't really been a change in the recommendation of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8761)|
| 2:26:10| Staff reviewed it on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| We had give and take and staff recommended approval of our request with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| It's MPC itself that turned that over and went the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8780)|
| 2:26:26| The two conditions I have no problem and my client has no problem with condition one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| which relates to landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| Condition number two is a requirement that we give up one of our two points of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8795)|
| 2:26:43| If you look at the picture that I gave you, you will see that those two points of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| access Rutledge Pike in such a fashion that they're right turn in, right turn out only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8809)|
| 2:26:57| Now, the property that we have adjoining that's to the east of us, it has a median cut to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8817)|
| 2:27:08| but the access to this site is just through those two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| We have shown them in the drawing, the information on here is ours, not MTC's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| but if you'll note, we've got an arrow pointing for means of access by way of ingress and by way of egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8841)|
| 2:27:34| Seventy-five percent or better of the traffic to our facility will be going Rutledge Pike generally eastward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8854)|
| 2:27:43| gets to the point and the median cut crosses over and goes into our facility at the adjoining site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8863)|
| 2:27:53| goes over a scale, dumps its material and so forth, circles around on that interior road system in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8873)|
| 2:28:00| and comes back out the same way it came in and it turns right onto Rutledge Pike heading back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8880)|
| 2:28:08| That's easily 75 percent or better of our traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| With having those two points of access, if they want to buy material, landscape material, stone, sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| whatever for doing their yard work for some other customer or whomever, then if they want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| then they come down, turn right, go in that, immediately go to the left along the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| where that stuff is stored in bins, picks that material up and goes right back out to the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8912)|
| 2:28:39| turns to the right, heading back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| There is another driveway at the far western side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8923)|
| 2:28:51| There may be some discussion about whether it's a public street or whether it's a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| but in any event, there is what it is in reality and actuality, a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8936)|
| 2:29:03| that goes up to serve those six or seven residential locations up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| That is the point where we will have our detention facility for surface water dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8950)|
| 2:29:22| It will be right in that what would be the southwest corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8962)|
| 2:29:28| so we don't really have good access, if we have any access at all, to that street over there on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8968)|
| 2:29:37| So for that reason, we felt it was very important to have those vehicles have the ability to turn right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8977)|
| 2:29:45| come into our property, make a sort of a circle and go right back out and go back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8985)|
| 2:29:53| And for those who aren't going to go that way, if they're going to head east for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=8993)|
| 2:30:01| they would come out, go a short distance and hit the median cut at that roadway there on the southwest corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9001)|
| 2:30:12| and they would cross that median and then turn and go east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| As I said, that's a minimum number of vehicles going that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| and by far the majority of it's going to be going back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9023)|
| 2:30:33| We're not utilizing a major portion of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| If you did anything else by shutting off one of these means of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| it means somehow we have to build an interior roadway system so that those vehicles come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| circle around in some fashion on the property, and go back out the same way they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| We lose more property for our use in doing that, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| And number two, then we've got traffic coming and going in the same area that creates more traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9063)|
| 2:31:12| than that right in, right out way I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| So long and short of it is we support the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| We would ask that the staff recommendation to rezone this property CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9083)|
| 2:31:30| all that lies to the south of that red line be rezoned CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| and I would ask that condition number two to the approval be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9096)|
| 2:31:42| So I would need, I guess what we'd need then is a motion to approve MPC staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9102)|
| 2:31:51| except for condition number two and that condition number two be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| I'm ready for, well, let's say it like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| I hope I'm ready for questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| Now let me let Mr. Kelly comment while it's still fresh on his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| I think John's made a pretty good case as to why this should be a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| and why you should deny the rezoning request in that he's talking about the traffic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9140)|
| 2:32:25| of trucks circulating in and around on the property without some type of actual traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9145)|
| 2:32:33| which we could get through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| I think we're just speculating on what the traffic situation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| We do know that there is a median cut right now that goes into where the grinder and all that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| but anyone who's just going out there to buy mulch and the majority of the traffic is going to come from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| he said that already, the majority of the traffic is going to come from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| and they're going to have to make a U-turn in Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| which is a fairly high speed road at that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9179)|
| 2:33:06| We would like to, the engineer that reviewed this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| recommended that they use the western-most access where the existing median cut is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9190)|
| 2:33:18| Barring that, they saw the need for all the U-turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| and anytime you have driveway points, those are, you know, in the traffic engineering world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| those are called conflict points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| Anytime you have a conflict point, you have potential for an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| So the recommendation to eliminate one of the access points is what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| minimally I believe is what the staff would look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| We're just, you know, we have no issue with the business itself being at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| We just feel like that planning needs to go into the siding of the actual operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| His concern about maybe moving the grinder over to that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| they're already aware that they may want to put the grinder over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| I think they could submit a contingency plan along with their use on review request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9246)|
| 2:34:12| that would show where their grinder would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| and that could be approved at the first time around if that's where they think they may go in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9255)|
| 2:34:23| Again, the Planning Commission recommended a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| They felt like the use of this piece of property needed public review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| and therefore did recommend a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| I want to make sure the access between these two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9282)|
| 2:34:55| in other words, where we are currently and the one we're asking be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| we're not going to be providing access between those two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| for people who come in to use either one of those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| The roadway within these two properties will be constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| for the purpose of handling interior traffic, our own vehicles and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9318)|
| 2:35:26| I'm not following the U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| If you're going out Rutledge Pike to get into the property that's up there labeled Walker Property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9329)|
| 2:35:38| towards the top of the page, you turn right into that median cut and access the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9338)|
| 2:35:47| If you come back out the same way and you turn east and you're going to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| you're going to turn right to go into this property we're talking about rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9352)|
| 2:35:59| To go out, you're going to go out the other access point closer towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9359)|
| 2:36:08| There's no U-turn involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| It's right turn in, right turn out on both of those means of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9370)|
| 2:36:20| Right now, of course, the idea is to keep the operation we've got going now on the existing site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| going where and as it is, but like I said, in the future sometimes things change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| and we'd like to have this property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| If you look at your material in your packet, I believe you'll find that there is CB to the east of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9398)|
| 2:36:49| There's CB across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| There's CB across the street and further back towards town from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| We're certainly not out of character as far as our zoning request is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| We put our current operation on that property when it was CB zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9424)|
| 2:37:10| and we've had no problems or issues with our utilization of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9430)|
| 2:37:18| Again, I would respectfully ask that the request for approval of CB be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9438)|
| 2:37:25| and that you remove condition number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| I guess my final point would be that this property got zoned planned commercial in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9452)|
| 2:37:39| A number of you, I guess, were on commission at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| and at the time the property got zoned planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| there was condition placed on that zoning that said there would be no grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| or land disturbance until a plan was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| There is some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| The back part of the property gets pretty steep back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| There are some site issues that need to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| So from a public policy standpoint, this commission in 2009 said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| we would like to see a plan before you do anything on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| and we believe that that was a good statement to make at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| and it's a good statement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| We've had statement, rebuttal, statement, and rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| We'll now go to questions from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| Mr. King, is this expansion of the business, hiring more employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| or is it just moving things around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| What is the motivation for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| Well, it is expansion of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9528)|
| 2:38:53| Ultimately, my client is going to need more employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| because we're getting more of a volume of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| in addition to just expanding this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| I can't tell you exactly how many more employees there will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9546)|
| 2:39:11| but we're going to have this facility continuing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| It will have more volume to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| We will have the facility going out in the Solway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| It will have more volume to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| and we're adding a third location in the center city at Proctor Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| and we've got to have people there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| I don't know that I can tell you how many more employees we'll end up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| but there will be in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| I drove that road many times in my past because I grew up in that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| The topography is, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| is it going up a hill there as you come up and it's on the left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| Yes, it is going slightly uphill as you're going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| The property itself, once you start from the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| as it goes toward the back, it rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| It's not coming over a hill blind if somebody was trying to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| You've got good sight distance down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| I don't know that it makes any difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| but in dealing with slope issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| or the hillside and ridgetop issues and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| that's the reason we did what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| when we ended up agreeing to this line that's on your material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9633)|
| 2:40:39| I would say that in conversation with the prior owner of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9639)|
| 2:40:44| and I don't remember how far back it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| but the slope that's on this property was, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9646)|
| 2:40:52| created by taking dirt off the site back years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| and that sort of created your elevations that are currently on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9658)|
| 2:41:06| When it is where it starts and then starts to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| that's not necessarily a natural slope that was there to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| It was one that was created by excavation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| Another quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| The proposed exit, even though it looks like it's there now on our map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| it's not there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| The proposed traffic pattern going out is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| Oh, it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| That's one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| The one to the east of that in front of a little building that's sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| one in front of that, and then this other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| if you'll look where it says proposed traffic pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| and that arrow makes a turn to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| that's right down the middle of the second means of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| And on the furthest to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| are those five houses up there on that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| There is one house, maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9727)|
| 2:42:16| The rest of those structures up there are double whites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9736)|
| 2:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| And as you can see, part of the reason we drew that line at an angle like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| was to give more buffer between what we did and those residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9753)|
| 2:42:41| or what we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| They've got a lot of trees in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| and we're leaving a lot of trees toward the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| When we started out, we talked about I think it was a depth of 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9770)|
| 2:42:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| It was something around 200 feet depth of trees left toward the rear of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| and we're way beyond that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| Mr. Kelly, a quick question for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| The proposed exit, MPC was not comfortable with that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| They have two current driveways with a third potential at the median cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| Again, the engineer that reviewed the request said the middle driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9804)|
| 2:43:29| the one that we have talked about them doing away with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| was constructed without a TDOT permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| so there may be potential that they could lose that driveway anyway if TDOT came along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| and said, hey, you all never get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| So from that standpoint, that's the driveway we've talked about doing away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| Commissioner Hoidby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| Commissioner Thomas asked a lot of the questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| One of the things I'm looking at is this, I guess, the first west driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9845)|
| 2:44:14| It looks like a street because it feeds these houses and trailers or mobile homes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9854)|
| 2:44:26| And that's why I'm kind of wondering if we eliminate that middle one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| do they have access to that technically street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9870)|
| 2:44:35| Because it's not technically on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| It feeds those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| but it would be a good question that could be answered through the use-or-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| It does, it provides access to those houses up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| but it appears that this piece of property has frontage on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| As a matter of fact, it appears that the easement actually crosses the corner of their property, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9895)|
| 2:45:03| The concern that Mr. King and he and I talked about it quite a bit this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| is that that's the area where they have their settled detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9908)|
| 2:45:14| and not only is the detention pond being put there for stormwater reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| because of the type of business it is, there is environmental concerns with the materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9919)|
| 2:45:26| the leaching of things out of the compost that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| So they will have to have a detention pond on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| And that is the lowest point, I believe, on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| So it makes sense to put it there, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| you have an existing median cut in a four-lane federal highway to provide access to that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9942)|
| 2:45:51| and it makes good sense, if possible, to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| Okay, so that brings up a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| If the retention pond is going to go there, then there will not be any access to that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9959)|
| 2:46:11| We don't know if there's any other engineering solutions to that, whether it can be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| I guess that's what I'm kind of trying to figure out in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| that if we eliminate the middle one and then they put a retention pond here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| then they're down to one access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| And they could circulate around on their own property at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9989)|
| 2:46:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| Yes, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| Several questions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| One for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| You know, I've looked on KGIS while we've been sitting here talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| I counted 13 access points that didn't have a median cut right away, just around maybe not even a mile in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| I mean, this area of roadway, I mean, there's a driveway in between these two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| I mean, there's constant U-turns by design, by TDOT, because they've given access to everybody to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10023)|
| 2:47:11| And so that second access point to me is currently there on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| If this was not an existing building, if this wasn't existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| if this didn't come to this company, didn't want to hit this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| this has already got two lots approved to it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| It's already got two entry and exit, an entry and exit out of it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| So why take it away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| I mean, this has been a general store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10054)|
| 2:47:35| This has been an agricultural feed store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| This has been a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| And that's just in my lifetime that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| And so it's already had that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| And then if you look at the third access, the most western, most of that is TDOT right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10066)|
| 2:47:56| only up to the property line where the asphalt changes and the walkers own part of that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10076)|
| 2:48:02| It looks like halfway up the hill they own part of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| They may not know that, but they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| And then in the discussion of, in the minutes of the meeting, I've looked through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10088)|
| 2:48:18| and Mr. Green's comment in the minutes, and this is obviously a paraphrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10098)|
| 2:48:26| driveway is in the county, right-of-way is in the city, and it's a TDOT road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10106)|
| 2:48:30| We have no authority here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| So you don't make, it's not up to NPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| It is a true statement in that we can make recommendations to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| as to what we believe the access should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| And typically if the city and the county engineering department make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10125)|
| 2:48:50| TDOT typically would abide by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10133)|
| 2:48:54| And so based on that discussion, that statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| TDOT's already given an entry and exit to clearances on this piece of property before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10137)|
| 2:49:05| They've already okayed this to entry and exit on this one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| I don't deny that it has three access points right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| What we're suggesting in any time you have a high-speed situation where you have intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10154)|
| 2:49:22| intersections on these types, excuse me, accidents on these types of roadways happen at the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10162)|
| 2:49:30| They're not happening out in the middle of the road out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| It's when people are trying to get on and off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| That's where the accidents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| And every time that we, and I'm not trying, we're not trying to take something away from the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10176)|
| 2:49:45| We are trying to, what we believe, address what could be a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| and could help the situation out there by eliminating a conflict point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10190)|
| 2:49:57| Hopefully that would improve safety in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| And at the same time, provide them with adequate access to operate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| Again, we have no issue with the business itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| Glad that they got the contract and are going to be able to have a plan for how they're going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| Actually be able to save the city some money because of multiple sites that they can take stuff to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| Was part of the no votes, I guess, or the denial votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10224)|
| 2:50:31| was it because of what type of business it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| You're talking about the no votes to approve the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| No, I think those no votes go back to what I said initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| I think the people that were voting no were going, why don't we rezone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| It's permitted in the planned commercial zone to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| Is it permitted in ag zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| I don't believe it is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| It's not? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| And what is the, Mr. King, what's the opposition by the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| Because if you look on KGIS on the aerial photo, there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10269)|
| 2:51:14| they've got two access points on Rutledge Park, but if you go and look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| they've got access to the other road that we're all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| What's the opposition of extending that and making that an exit point instead of having the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| Well, there's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10289)|
| 2:51:34| If you will, first of all, as has already been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| the prime location and the best location for a detention facility is in that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10298)|
| 2:51:45| As you've already observed, we're going to be just inside the right-of-way on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10305)|
| 2:51:51| in the location of where we put that in that southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| So you can't move the retention pond 40 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| Well, you may be able to, but keep in mind that if we open that up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10320)|
| 2:52:14| we may have to ultimately, but if you open that up for our traffic to go all the way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10334)|
| 2:52:21| to get to that point to turn and then go to Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| now you have, once again, two-way access at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10345)|
| 2:52:31| You'll have trucks coming in, trying to deal with trucks going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| So, I mean, it's easier to control that traffic pattern if we've got a situation where this is where you come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10359)|
| 2:52:50| it's a right turn in, and when you go through, you go right down to there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| and you have a turn right back out on and right turn only going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10374)|
| 2:53:00| If you put that, not only are you putting truck traffic on what is, in essence, a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10380)|
| 2:53:10| but you're putting them on there and you're going to have them going both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| Somebody that knows he's been there before a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10395)|
| 2:53:19| he doesn't want to go up to drop off anything to have it ground for mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10399)|
| 2:53:26| he's just going out there to buy mulch material and some stone and sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10406)|
| 2:53:32| and he knows he doesn't have to go all the way up there to the entrance to our other facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| and go through that median cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| He can go through that median cut down here and turn in and travel then a short distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10419)|
| 2:53:45| to get to turn right to try to go through our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| meeting vehicles going the other way from that other single access on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10428)|
| 2:53:55| And also trying to interface, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10435)|
| 2:54:01| with the residential structures that are there that that driveway serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10441)|
| 2:54:09| I mean, I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| I am not a traffic engineer, but I am an observer of what traffic does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10451)|
| 2:54:19| And I keep looking at this and it makes real sense to me to have the right turn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| to go a short distance, then go to your next access point and have a right turn going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10466)|
| 2:54:36| That takes care of your traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| It keeps you out of the interior of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| keeps them from interfering with any kind of activity that may be going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10482)|
| 2:54:47| and that's the easiest, quickest way for them to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| Can I ask one more question, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| The 6319 Ulrich Park, which looks to be a house that's in between, an acre or two that's in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10495)|
| 2:55:01| is that in use by the company or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| That is not. That is a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| And they did not object to our utilization of the site that's going now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| and they've interposed no objection to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10516)|
| 2:55:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| I use the Natural Resources Recovery Facility off of Oak Ridge Highway and Joe Daniels Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10524)|
| 2:55:31| I'm there at least three times a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| That facility has one entrance and one exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| When you drive up, you either decide that you're going on the scales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| or you go to the left to pick up the mulch or the pine straw or whatever else you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| So it can work with one entrance in and one entrance out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| Has anybody else ever been to that facility off of Joe Daniels Road in the 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| Yes, a couple of times. It's got a 25-foot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| Okay. Now, the difference is if you go there and drop your brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| and then you get back on Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| you have to head into Solway to make a U-turn to head back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10569)|
| 2:56:15| You've got traffic coming in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| so you're starting from a dead stop to make a U-turn to go back, heading back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10578)|
| 2:56:25| What they're proposing on this is that the folks who are coming from Knoxville to go to the mulch center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10585)|
| 2:56:33| is they're going to have to come to a dead stop at the U-turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| make that U-turn in front of oncoming traffic, go down maybe 100 feet and get into the right lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| and make a sharp right-hand turn into the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| I think we're looking at an accident waiting to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| I think Mr. Kelly made a great argument on a use-on-review for this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| so we can actually find out exactly where the entrance needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| because I think for somebody who's got a vehicle hauling one of those little personal trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10621)|
| 2:57:07| it's going to be a mess getting in and out of there the way they're stating their entrance and exit point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10627)|
| 2:57:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker was at the tail end of what he said is what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| It sounds like we're doing real-time use-on-review work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| and it just doesn't seem like we're not traffic engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| Some of us have been on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| Several of us have been on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| But it sounds like this isn't done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| It just doesn't seem to be quite ready for prime time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| So I'm really in favor of going back to a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10672)|
| 2:57:55| I don't want to compare this to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| I respect what you're saying, but I've lived out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| That road, when it was expanded to four lane, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| there was hope that there would be a lot more businesses put there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| and most of them are industrial-type businesses, heavy equipment and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| And I just don't see it being the same accident rate happened in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10696)|
| 2:58:23| Plus, the slope of that road, you see everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| And if none of these residents around it complained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| I really don't see the problem with approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10713)|
| 2:58:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10723)|
| 2:58:44| I have a couple questions for both Dan and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10724)|
| 2:58:50| Mr. King, the east location, the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| there will be no connection from there to the new west parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| that you are looking to pick up and expand on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| I want to make sure I'm following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| You're talking about the eastern entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| Where the medium cut is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| Where the medium cut is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| Will there be a road connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| An interior road connecting to this other parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| There will be an interior road up here at the northeast corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| where it runs up to that triangle up at the very top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| There will be an interior road from the existing site to come over onto this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10768)|
| 2:59:36| basically follow that eastern boundary line down and into the work area of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10776)|
| 2:59:44| But public vehicular traffic is not going to be allowed to go through this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10784)|
| 2:59:54| around that interior road to get access to this piece that we're wanting to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| That's just for our interior use only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10802)|
| 3:00:03| And the exterior, the west, extreme west driveway easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| whatever it is that services these houses up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| it is your opinion that the size of the detention pond and the limited use of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| will not allow you to go around it onto the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| You're talking about go around the detention facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| If you go around the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| I think what you're going to run into is you would be then trying to make a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10835)|
| 3:00:45| If you came in off the other access, the first access, the most eastern access to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10845)|
| 3:00:54| if you came in there, what you would end up doing is doing an angle, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10854)|
| 3:01:01| to come into or attempt to come into that driveway further to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10861)|
| 3:01:08| You'd have to avoid that corner down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| So all you're doing is putting that truck traffic on what now is, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10871)|
| 3:01:19| really I don't know how to describe it other than it's a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10879)|
| 3:01:28| I don't think that would be really very suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10888)|
| 3:01:35| I'm not saying that it can't be engineered that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| but it was not in our contemplation as to utilizing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10898)|
| 3:01:44| We did not contemplate that we would use that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| If we put such a road in to enable us to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| what I said is now you're going to have the option of having truck traffic come in at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10913)|
| 3:02:00| turn to the right to access our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| As vehicles are trying to come out of it, turn into the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10923)|
| 3:02:06| and we have those six houses up there utilizing that facility for that roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10926)|
| 3:02:13| using that roadway that's there for their driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| I still get back to, I can remember when they had over at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10939)|
| 3:02:24| they had, if you were on Cumberland Avenue crossing in front of the UT Law School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10944)|
| 3:02:29| it was a nice, flat, beautiful area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| They spent a lot of money planting grass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| It had signs out there that said do not walk on grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| and there were cut walks where everybody walked cutting across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10957)|
| 3:02:42| What they did was they took all that up and they put in a big hump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| like you would do a big swale that they had to walk over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| They didn't have to have any more signs after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| They didn't want to walk up that little bank, so they walked around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| What's going to happen here is using those two points of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| is going to be the natural thing to do and expect about moving traffic on and off that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10985)|
| 3:03:13| Mr. Kelly, the elimination of one of the entrances on this new parcel that they're looking to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=10993)|
| 3:03:20| in no way affects the perceived dangers of the U-turns made in the medium cut, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11000)|
| 3:03:29| No, it wouldn't help that situation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| Okay, and the MP staff had recommended approval with the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11012)|
| 3:03:38| And I think the planning commission, the 15-member citizen body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11018)|
| 3:03:44| looked at the staff recommendation and heard what was going on and said, you know, this is half done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11024)|
| 3:03:51| We need more information before we can make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11031)|
| 3:03:56| So the westernmost access where the median cut is, we're not real sure that that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11036)|
| 3:04:04| Common sense would say, though, that would be the best place to get onto the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| on or off the property, an existing median cut if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| But if you can't use that access, there are other engineering solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| potentially extended left-turn desal lanes, axle lanes, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| that may be needed or required in order to try to address safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11064)|
| 3:04:32| And that's why, again, I'm here this evening, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| in voicing the action of the planning commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11077)|
| 3:04:41| and I believe that's the direction that they wanted this commission to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| Would there be any difference in the recommendation if this were not an expansion of existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| or this was just a stand-alone, somebody brought you this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11091)|
| 3:05:02| I don't know that I know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| You asked a good question earlier about is there going to be a connection between the two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11105)|
| 3:05:11| You know, first blush would go, well, you turn in there, you go through their existing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11111)|
| 3:05:17| pick up on the other end and go out the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| But, again, we don't know that that would actually work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| and we could understand there would be reservations of particularly having, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11123)|
| 3:05:28| Joe Blow, general public, going back around the grinder and all this other stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| You know, the city trucks, and there are going to be a lot of city trucks dropping brush at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11132)|
| 3:05:43| And I can understand them going in and dropping and going back out the way they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11143)|
| 3:05:49| But, you know, our initial thought was, well, why don't you just connect the two together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| Well, Mr. King explained the issue with regard to where they would have to be and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11153)|
| 3:06:00| So that may or may not be a real solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| But, again, we're going on based on what the applicant has told us at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11164)|
| 3:06:10| and no real specific information that would say yes, that will work or no, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11170)|
| 3:06:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| Mr. King, while we're fresh on the mind here, I want to call on Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11180)|
| 3:06:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11185)|
| 3:06:26| Mr. Kelly, on your map that you referred to when we first started this discussion, the green line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11186)|
| 3:06:33| there is a note here beside it that says a staff-recommended zoning line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| CV zoning south of the green dash line only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| That doesn't have anything to do with entrance and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11201)|
| 3:06:45| One of the conditions of the staff recommendation was the elimination of one of the access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11205)|
| 3:06:50| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| If I may, Mr. Chairman, I wanted you to keep in mind we can't use that easternmost entrance to our existing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11215)|
| 3:07:08| through the median cut to get public traffic and vehicles coming in to dump trash, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11228)|
| 3:07:17| We can't get them across that piece of property and into the piece we're talking about to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11237)|
| 3:07:24| First of all, right in the middle of it, we've got a piece of agricultural zoning with a house on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11244)|
| 3:07:30| so we can't go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| If you start looking at trying to create a road that's going to carry traffic back and forth on our existing site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11252)|
| 3:07:41| and particularly if you try to use our easternmost median cut in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| now you've got a traffic pattern going up the right-hand or the eastern side of our proposed rezoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11267)|
| 3:07:56| So you've got to have a big wide road for trucks to pass each other, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11276)|
| 3:08:03| It comes all the way across the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| It will take out the building, which may be taken out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| The barn that's there will be taken out, but you're going right through the heart of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11289)|
| 3:08:16| we're proposing to try to use for our operation with a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11296)|
| 3:08:23| Again, you've got to get them on there, get them across the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11303)|
| 3:08:32| and then get a way for them to turn around and go back out the same way they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11312)|
| 3:08:40| You do that, and you've just taken up more space that's for utilization for the use intended for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11320)|
| 3:08:56| I respectfully submit that if you go to the existing site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11336)|
| 3:09:04| I think you will see that the operation that's there is the most efficient use of that current site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11344)|
| 3:09:12| from an engineering and a travel standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11352)|
| 3:09:18| I think that sort of indicates that this entity knows how to develop it and do it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11358)|
| 3:09:26| and you can't just expect that he can't do it without input from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11366)|
| 3:09:36| I respectfully renew my request, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| I guess when you look at an appeal of a zoning issue and to overturn the denial from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11384)|
| 3:09:53| that we should be hearing an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence to overturn the MPC decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11393)|
| 3:10:01| that it shouldn't be that there's more questions upon more questions upon more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11401)|
| 3:10:06| I think the staff has done an excellent job of making the case that we are not supposed to be designing roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11406)|
| 3:10:13| for a piece of property, that the best course of action is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11413)|
| 3:10:19| And I think that we should take the MPC staff recommendation to have this as a use on review on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11419)|
| 3:10:29| because in my mind there has not been this overwhelming preponderance of why we should overturn the MPC's decision on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11429)|
| 3:10:41| Point of order on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| And that question was to you, gentlemen and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| I'll make it, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| A motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| Okay, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| He's made a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11457)|
| 3:10:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11458)|
| 3:10:59| You know, the MPC staff made a recommendation, who's a paid group of planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| The MPC overturned it, and it's our obligation to look into and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11463)|
| 3:11:10| And if we can't do that, then there's no purpose for us to be hearing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11470)|
| 3:11:15| And so if you don't want me to ask questions and try to meet, this is a mixed signal from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11475)|
| 3:11:23| Clearly a mixed signal from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| And for us, for you to speak that we shouldn't ask questions is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| If I may, I'd like a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| Just a second, just a second, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| I never said that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| I said just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11501)|
| 3:11:49| Exercise your microphone there just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| Take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| I never said we could not ask questions in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11522)|
| 3:12:09| All I'm saying is on a zoning appeal, the appellant has to provide overwhelming evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11529)|
| 3:12:20| to overturn what the MPC commissioners have voted on, and I haven't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11540)|
| 3:12:25| I never said that any of us sitting on this forum cannot ask a question of either party's president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| But in my opinion, what the staff recommendation has said, that we need to move as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11552)|
| 3:12:39| I follow that and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| I do not agree that the appellant here has overwhelmingly convinced us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11561)|
