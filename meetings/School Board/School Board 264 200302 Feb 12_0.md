And I see Randy Smith. Thanks so much for being here. I don't think I see anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=273)|
| 0:04:56| A few announcements. Several board members will be attending the TSBA Legislative and Legal Institute at the Doubletree downtown Nashville on February 17th and 18th.

| 0:05:26| Also just a reminder board members, TSBA will be holding three day school board academy sessions in Knoxville this spring on April 5th, April, I'm sorry March 5th, April 21st, and May 5th. So there are three one day sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=326)|
| 0:05:45| These core sessions fulfill our state mandated and annual training. So if you have not chosen a session yet, please let Ms. Coatney know as soon as possible which one you'd like to attend.

| 0:06:02| Thank you Madam Chair, members of the board. Due to forecasted flash flooding and high winds for the early morning hours, Knox County schools will open one hour late on Thursday, February 13th, 2020. Buses also will run one hour late. However, school administrators, maintenance, custodial staff, and central office will report on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=362)|
| 0:06:24| And again the concern we have especially with our bus routes and so forth and the ground moisture that with high winds there could be trees that fall and we want to make sure that our bus drivers and inexperienced drivers have visibility in the morning. So one hour delay for tomorrow. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=384)|

| 0:11:45| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Okay. Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Babb. Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to defer this for 30 days, mainly on the basis of we're not exactly sure about the cost, or I'm not, about the cost that we're going to accrue from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=714)|
| 0:12:11| So I'd like to make a substitute motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Okay. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| I guess I'd like to hear if there are any concerns from the Security Department if this would affect anything if we defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| I'll second so we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=751)|
| 0:12:42| Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So we have a substitute motion by Mr. Norman and a second by Ms. Bounds. And Mr. Oaks, would you like to address that, or Mr. Produces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=762)|
| 0:12:52| I'd prefer to let Chief Produces address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Chief Produces, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| Chief, did you hear the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| And thank you. I would offer two viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Number one is our plan had been to implement as much of the visitor management system as we could in the spring, and to go ahead and work most of the kinks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=792)|
| 0:13:25| There'll be some stumbling blocks, I'm certain, a project this big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| So we wanted to get it implemented in the spring, work through the kinks, and so that when we started in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| there would not be one more new thing to have to manage as we started back the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| And so that's one concern, not that we're in a huge hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And then the second issue is this grant, the money does expire the last day of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| Now, we have some time to do that, but the clock is ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| It was a 24-month grant, and it will end at the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| And then there are some limitations on the amount of time that you can hold a bid open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| And I'm not overly familiar with those, but it's my understanding that you can only hold a bid open for 90 days before you have to start over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=851)|
| 0:14:22| And we had the right people at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| We followed the normal protocols to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| We had the right committee put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And so we've spent a significant amount of time to be certain that this is a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| And so we certainly would urge that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| We're ready to move forward, but obviously we'll defer to what the Board's wishes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| Okay. Mr. Norman, do you have a follow-up question? No. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| Well, I appreciate the amount of time that administration has put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| I think adopting something like this without time for public input is something that we really need to look at carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=901)|
| 0:15:14| This will impact every person who visits our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| So taking time for some public input and questions and finding those answers I think would be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=918)|
| 0:15:28| Okay. Ms. Satterfield. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I'm not opposed to Tony's substitute motion, but I just kind of want to just speak on my personal experience with systems like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| So in my line of work, I do a lot of traveling in and out of schools, and most schools have some type of system in this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| To where Knox County Schools, we just have a sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And just being honest, you hardly can read what I put on the sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| So there's a level of we don't know who's in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| And so I do think that we do need to move into a direction of monitoring who comes into the building or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| So I appreciate Knox County coming, looking into something like this, because the sign-in sheet is just a little dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=964)|
| 0:16:12| But I do understand the questions that do come up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Mr. Produces, because I know I've directed these questions to you from a couple – I had a couple people contact me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| kind of representing the immigrant population, and I think you gave some great insight that I was able to pass on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| And so if you could just speak to the concerns that I was getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I think people are afraid this is going to cause, like, immigration background checks and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| And so if you could just explain what exactly is being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| I think that will help some people understand this a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| This system will really only check one issue, and that will be the sex offender registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| That is the only software and the only download that the vendor downloads onto the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| and they do that daily to keep the list current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| So the sex offender data is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| It does not check immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| It does not check child support payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| It does not check citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| It does not check criminal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| And our plan is, in addition to the sex offender registry, to add our criminal trespass database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| And we talked about that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| We do have several people that have been disruptive to the educational process on our campuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and we issue them a trespass letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Now, we try to give them a civility code letter and some different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| but the only data that the vendor downloads into the system is the sex offender registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1055)|
| 0:17:45| In the 95 counties in Tennessee, Knox County is the fourth highest county for sex offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| There's 19,800 in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| There are 562 sex offenders in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| and there is not a school in our district that does not have sex offenders within a two-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| Sex offender data is public record, and if you plug in the zip code in the TBI database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| you will be horrified at the number of sex offenders that live very, very close to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| And so the notion that it's going to check all the other issues is simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| And then we talked a little bit about do you have to have a government-issued ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| which speaks a little bit to the immigration concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And the truth is you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| You do not have to have a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| You do not have to have government-issued ID because not everyone has a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And so ultimately, we will encourage people to have picture IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| but it will not be a requirement to enter our schools once we adopt this, nor is it a requirement now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| And so ultimately, it will be a human decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| If there's someone who shows up that do not have a lot of identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| but over the course of time and as people get accustomed to the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| we will send out welcoming letters to explain the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| and we anticipate most people coming to school with their ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| but some people come to school now with no identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| and it is still ultimately a human decision based on the administration's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| and they'll be able to summon the school security officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| much like the situation where we have if someone comes to the front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| and we're not quite sure who they are, you just engage in a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I think Ms. Irwin's light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| I believe you said that the only data the vendor downloads to the system is the sex offender data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| Could we input other data, or could we get other data from law enforcement and put that into the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1201)|
| 0:20:10| Is that ability in the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| There is no capacity for us to download criminal histories or NCIC checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| which is the National Crime Information Center that checks for wants or warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| We don't have the ability to access that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| We are not allowed to access that information, and our plan is to only input the trespass database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1231)|
| 0:20:40| So we do not have the capacity to plug in criminal histories or background information or child support, any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| Have no way to get that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| No, ma'am. No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| And no one else could access the system to do it on our behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Now, could there be a hack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I would imagine you can hack most any system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| I'm thinking more of a permission somewhere that we're not thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We certainly don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| When we put our committee together, we had a strong representation from our IT folks to help us understand the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1271)|
| 0:21:20| and so we're very comfortable that the data is protected, much like we protect all of our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| And so, like I said, we had the right people at the table to include our IT folks to help us understand questions like yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Thanks, Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| And I totally respect your all's work on this and the security folks that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| My only problem is I'm just not familiar enough to vote on something right now that affects every single school in this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1311)|
| 0:22:02| and all the folks in this county, really, in terms of access to these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| So, I'd just like to know more, and I think 30 days is not going to hurt us that bad to find out more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| We were not engaged in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| This is just brought to us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| And so that's the reason why I think it would be wise for us to give this 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| But I do appreciate all that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I know we spoke last week about the ability of the system to track visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| And so I know in the past that a lot of PTAs have to submit their volunteer hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| So is that the intention of that piece would be to provide that type service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| I would tell you there's three pieces that are positive byproducts of having a visitor management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| Number one is you can absolutely track your volunteer hours if it's a recognition program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| and you want to figure out who's doing the volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| This will allow you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| A second piece is districts have had some success when vendors or contractors visit your campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| and they log in to the system, and then they go off to the school and do some work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| and then they exit the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| And when you exit the school, you log out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So if I'm there to work on the heating and air, it tells me when I get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| and it tells me when I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| And so if I'm there for three hours, some districts have had some success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| matching that visitor entry log into invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| For instance, I'm there for three hours, but yet I bill you for ten hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Some districts have had some success matching the actual on-service time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| versus the bill that they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| And then a third byproduct is if you have a catastrophic event in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| and you need to be sure that everyone is out of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| one of the tools is that you can access that visitor management log,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| and if you have a parent or a teacher that may work there or you have a volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| or you have a vendor or the Coke man is there to fill up the Coke machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| and you can't find them and they have not evacuated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and they are not on the outside of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| this system will allow you to figure out that you've got two or three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| unaccounted for unless you may make the decision that there are still people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| inside the school because not everybody that is logged in to be inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| has exited or evacuated the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| So those are three of the real positive pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| And are those collected at the building level or at the district level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| You can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| We will be able to develop district level customizable reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| as well as at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| And would those be at the request of specific, will that just vary by school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| or will there be some information that would be building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| and some district level I would assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| We can determine, once the system is up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| we can determine how we want to manage those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| So we have a motion on the floor to defer this item for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| and we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| If there's no other discussion, we'll go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| And opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So let's just do a roll call to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| We'll start with district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| So we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| So if you vote yes, you are voting to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| If you vote no, you're voting to vote on this this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| So we have two yes votes and seven no votes, six no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| So we will vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Is there discussion on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| The other item that might be of interest is that I was contacted by another vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| and they have a system, identification system, and were not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| So anyway, I mean, I don't even know who they are, but they were offering up some other ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| So that's another reason to delay, in my opinion, and that's the reason why I'll vote to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Would you like to address that, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I can address that some, and I see that Matt Myers is here from procurement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| But this contract went through the Knox County procurement process, as it should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| and as Chief mentioned, it was vetted properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| All the I's were dotted, T's were crossed, and there was competitive bidders who bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| And I don't know if one of those was one that contacted you, Mr. Norman, or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| but from the law department's position, I mean, the competitors have had their chance to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1660)|
| 0:27:50| and all the processes were followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Yeah, and I just want to reiterate now that our check-in system is a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| So I appreciate us getting a little bit more security in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I mean, I think if you look at we have 562 sex offenders in Knox County who live beside our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| And actually, I understand the piece about that we do have some people that don't have a government ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| but I think that should be rare that people are allowed in our schools without some form of photo identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| because it would be very easy to have people in our schools that don't need to be there if they don't bring that ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| So, okay. Any other comments, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Okay. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| We have Mr. Norman dissenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1728)|

| 0:30:52| I would like to make a substitute motion and I move to substitute the approval of the memorandum of agreement regarding the relocation of Knox County Schools central offices to the TVA East Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1852)|
| 0:31:05| to defer the vote of the MOU until either the Tennessee Attorney General states the move is legally allowable or until the state law is amended to allow the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1865)|
| 0:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Bounds and a second by Mr. Norman. Okay, discussion? Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1881)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I wasn't aware until just recently that we have a bill that has been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| It's House Bill 1935 by Bill Dunn and State Bill 1886 by Becky Duncan Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| And this bill says local education agencies as introduced authorizes an LEA's local board of education to locate the board's administrative offices within a building owned by the United States government or an agency or instrumentality of the United States government pursuant to a lease or easement authorized by the United States government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1907)|
| 0:32:11| And this amends TCA Title 49, Chapter 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| So, I think with both of those things on the table, it was my understanding maybe incorrectly at the January meeting that we were waiting on the Attorney General's ruling and evidently now maybe people aren't sure of how that's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1935)|
| 0:32:35| So, now we have a House and a Senate bill that, let me see the information here, exactly, is moving through the House and the Senate both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1955)|
| 0:32:46| So, I think it would be in the board's best interest to wait until one of those two have been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| Okay, Ms. Rabb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| The memorandum of understanding before, I guess I'm not in favor of that because I do feel like the memorandum of understanding before us actually does not allow this to go forward unless there are three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1977)|
| 0:33:11| Unless that bill is passed, unless the Attorney General gives a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| So, I feel like there are provisions in this already that we can't, this is not going to work unless that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| So, I think, you know, from my understanding, everybody in the county would like to know if we are favorable so they can move ahead on plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| But this has got to be a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| What you're waiting for has got to be a contingency for this MOU to even work anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| So, that would be my reason for being behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| But I do think we have to have one of those three entities passing that the custody and control is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Okay, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| At our December meeting, we took a good faith vote to wait until we had a legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2029)|
| 0:33:59| And my constituents have been calling and asking why we aren't honoring that vote, why this is back on the agenda when we don't have an opinion from the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2039)|
| 0:34:10| So, I'm concerned that we're ignoring a vote that we took regarding the MOU, that we are moving forward with something that we doubt the legality of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2050)|
| 0:34:26| And I think we have confirmation of that doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| And I had intended to talk about the Senate Bill 1886.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| That's why I had those copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| If this were legal, we would not have a bill suggesting that it be made legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2079)|
| 0:34:50| So, clearly there is an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And to forge forward when we know that we may be doing something illegal is a level of irresponsibility that is just astounding to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2095)|
| 0:35:07| We took a vote that we should be upholding, and we have doubts about the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| I don't understand why this is even on our agenda again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| So, I would definitely agree with Ms. Bounds that we need to put this off until we have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Go ahead, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| And so, yes, we don't have the opinion from that one individual that you were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| But there's been ample amount of county commissioner meetings where people came and spoke for hours to kind of explain the legalities of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2141)|
| 0:35:51| And I think it's, I think there's a level of, like, I can't, somebody that's been in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| been doing this type of work and legality work for more than I've been alive, me to tell them that they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| I think that that's, maybe you all know more to it, but just the level of expertise that was shared over and over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| for me, it just makes sense to just move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| That's just how I would vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So, that's, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| I was just going to ask if Mr. Dupler could speak to some of the concerns the Law Department has regarding moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| and why custody of concern is, I mean, custody and control is so concerning to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| And if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Dupler, the way the law reads, it's very, it doesn't state clearly, really, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Whether about the custody and control issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| If I need to be more specific, thinking about when we own a building and we choose to repurpose that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| for example, changing that building from a middle school to an elementary school or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| If we were to lose custody of control, custody and control of our school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| how would that impact our ability to repurpose buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Would they be our own buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Could we change how those were used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Yes, I mean, the state law, the Tennessee Code mandates that the local education association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| or LEA as it's called, but, you know, here it's the Board of Education, has custody and control over school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| Now, I mean, the bone of contention here is does the definition of school buildings include the district headquarters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2265)|
| 0:37:57| and then that spills over into, well, okay, what about an operations building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| What about, you know, other buildings that are under the custody and control of the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| So that's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And, again, I think attorneys can differ on it and, you know, good attorneys can differ on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| Our role is to advise not only this board but the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| I'll also say that our office has signed off on the form of this MOU that's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2304)|
| 0:38:35| I met with the law director himself, and Charlie Sturkey has been working on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| And so we approved the form of this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| It does have the contingency in there that one of three things has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| Either the attorney general opinion favors the move or the law has changed to favor the move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| or our opinion changes, which it hasn't at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| So the bottom line is this is really a policy decision on behalf of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| whether or not you want to defer this or go ahead and vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Either way, our office feels that it's a legal way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Yeah, I'm completely comfortable moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| There's been no shortage of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| I feel like, you know, the mayor's office has been transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I mean, they've answered all my questions, and like Mr. Dupler pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, that concern is addressed in this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| We're not going to be moving if it isn't legal for us to move, so I would prefer to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| There are 47 documents that county commission considered, and those 47 documents also impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2392)|
| 0:40:01| And those 47 documents have not been explained to us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| So when we're talking about an abundance of information, we've had a lot of people talking at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| We have had a lot of opinions given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| But everything that goes into the decision to move our offices to a federally controlled building with federal marshals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2415)|
| 0:40:28| the impacts of that have not been explained to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Those 47 documents, legal documents at that, should have been presented to us in an open meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2432)|
| 0:40:42| where the public could consider what we are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| This impacts the entire community, and it will impact the entire community for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| It's something that we need to take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| And whether we consider it as real ID or photo ID or whatever we consider it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| we need to very seriously realize that when we are looking at a building that is not in our control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| and is fully in federal control in the way it was explained to me by TVA was 100% federal security control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2477)|
| 0:41:29| we have to realize those students who we are constitutionally required to have in our school system cannot visit that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2489)|
| 0:41:43| And people repeatedly say to me, well, they can meet somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| If segregation is what we want for Knox County schools, this is what we need to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| That is, I don't even have words for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2515)|
| 0:42:04| Because over and over, what I'm told is, well, they can meet somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Those people can go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| When we get down to talking about those people not being able to come into our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| that is deeply concerning on every possible level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| When we think about the fact that we could have a person come to our building without their ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| whether they have ID or not, and they could end up in federal custody, that's deeply, deeply concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2557)|
| 0:42:46| We will have zero control of security for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| The federal government will have 100% control of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And we are willing to sit here and vote on an MOU after we have voted to not move forward yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| But we're going to vote on an MOU without considering all of those legal documents that we've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2587)|
| 0:43:17| without knowing where people are going to have to go to meet, without having real answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| We have a lot of people who have come and told us, well, you could do this and you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| That's not a very solid answer to any of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| If we even think that we are going to leave here with an agreement that says we are going to keep anyone out of a government building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2618)|
| 0:43:50| that we are going to keep any group of people from accessing a government office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| that we are going to say these people can meet us somewhere else, I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2637)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Ms. Owen. I'm not sure whose light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| Ms. Hill, was your light on next? Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| Okay, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| The main point I think Ms. Bounds brought up, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| We're just not sure about the legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| So that's the reason why I'll support that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| But I would like to ask a question, and I don't know whether to direct this at Chris Caldwell or the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| but I'm trying to interpret what this MOU means, especially to the sale of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| And it's my understanding that if we sold the AJ building right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| and say we sold it for the $6 million or whatever, then the school system would get the $6 million if we sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2704)|
| 0:45:13| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| So there is a resolution from 2009 that says any sale of school property goes back to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2717)|
| 0:45:29| What this MOU says, as drafted by Ron McPherson and myself and approved by the superintendent and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| just done better by attorneys after the fact, is that the sale of the AJ, assuming it gets approved by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| that money goes back into the building upgrades of the East Tower, and then the county picks up the additional cost that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2748)|
| 0:45:58| Okay, and I thought originally the mayor had said that the mayor was going to pay for the upgrades to the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2758)|
| 0:46:10| Still the same, but we have always said that we would take the proceeds from the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| to pay for a portion of the upgrades to our six floors that schools would occupy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| I'm just not comfortable with giving up $6 million in this process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| and I think the MOU does kind of put a stamp on that, and so just another reason besides the legality issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2790)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| I support Ms. Babb in her comments about the resolution that we're being asked to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| or the MOU does in fact cover many of these concerns, really all of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| We have truly hashed this to death, and to hear even, you know, Mr. Dupler say that the law department is in fact satisfied with this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2821)|
| 0:47:18| and it does in fact cover concerns that are brought up as far as the legality and the question about the bill currently in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2838)|
| 0:47:36| I just feel like everyone has pretty much bent over backwards to try to make this thing work and to appease all parties out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2856)|
| 0:47:50| so I really see no wisdom in any delay at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| I think that our mayor and our commission have acted in good faith to try to make this a win for everyone, and I believe that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2876)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Ms. Christine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I know this is recommended by Mr. Thomas, and maybe, well, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| Maybe if you or Mr. McPherson could speak to the financial benefits or if you have any concerns as to what Mr. Norman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| and then maybe if Mr. Caldwell, if you could address some of the ID concerns again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Ms. Christie's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Yes, there are some financial benefits for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you to Mayor Jacobs and also Mr. Caldwell working with us to try to look at the space cost that we've been paying over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| which is somewhere around a million dollars in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| So in conversations with the mayor and Mr. Caldwell, they have agreed that the space cost for us would be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| which would allow us to redirect funds that are already in our budget, and budget permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| well, looking at a 15-year period, roughly $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I think if you look at the 40-year period, roughly $60 million, I believe, was the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| So there's financial impact for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And as we have talked about before with the mental, emotional, social issues that students are having and, again, budget permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| what my hope would be and what we could be able to recommend to the board is we could redirect those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| and use them towards helping with the mental, emotional, and social needs of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| That's been the number one, I think, basically number one concern expressed to me by our teachers, by our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| We've had many conversations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| So I think that would go a long way in terms of us being able to address those needs and to redirect those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| And Mr. Caldwell, if you'd like to address that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| So as it relates to ID and Real ID, if Real ID takes effect in October, this would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3005)|
| 0:50:14| But currently, as it is with respect to the TVA East Tower, if you currently come into the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| and you don't have a driver's license, you cannot go up in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| You can ask PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| You can ask Jane Burrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| If you do not have a driver's license, you cannot go up in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Madam Chair, can we get some confirmation from some of our staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| If someone comes to that building to see them and they do not have a license, how is that handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| I would like to ask Mr. Thomas to weigh in on this issue, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Mr. Thomas, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| In discussing the TVA Tower and the bottom floor that would have space available for public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3059)|
| 0:51:09| as we've discussed that, it's been my thought process that any visitor that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| regardless of whether they have an ID or they don't, could utilize that space if they're meeting with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| if you could address that, and also if you can address the issue of current visitors who come into the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| Let me take the second question first because, again, PVA is responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| Probably someone from PVA would need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Let me go to the next question before that's addressed in terms of the meeting spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| We have been assured, what's been communicated is that there will be meeting spaces provided to us for us to meet with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| I know right now, again, we have an Andrew Johnson Building, disciplinary hearings and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| Of course, again, people that come to those hearings only go to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| So it's true that people can't just come into the building and access the upper floors without going through the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| So I feel comfortable and confident that what we've been told is, again, the meeting spaces will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| I don't know that it's really that unusual for staff to come down to the meeting area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| As long as there's a meeting area and privacy can be protected for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| then I think we're comfortable with the arrangements that we have been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I would like to reiterate my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I would like our staff to answer what they do if someone comes without ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3159)|
| 0:52:50| Dr. Reislich, if someone came to visit you and had no ID and knew them, could they come in or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3170)|
| 0:52:59| I know that PBA is going to tell us this, but I know it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| That's the problem I have, and that's why I need to interrupt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Because we keep being told by people who are not in that building over and over that a driver's license is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| and that a person cannot get past the first floor without a driver's license, and that's baloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Any person in this audience could walk over there with me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| and we could go up the elevator to anywhere we want to go, and that person would not have to show a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| I know Mrs. Goode, my administrative assistant, frequently is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Someone is in the building that wants to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| She'll go down, and she'll actually meet with whoever it is and also in charge of the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| But the protocol, as I understand right now, is that if I want to have a meeting with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I have to notify PBA, the security desk, that such and such person has got a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| and they're coming at whatever time that meeting is and get them cleared that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Now, again, I think identification, I'll let PBA address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| Identification would be required, but people just can't come in unless they slip by some way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| I can't say that it's impossible to do that, but there is someone at the desk each time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| and the only people that have access around the desk are the employees that work there who have a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| But I think it's also monitored by cameras, I believe, in the lobby area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| I'm Kristen Grove, director of property development for PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| and I do reside in the Andrew Johnson building on the seventh floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| We do have that desk staffed, and protocol is that the public does have to have a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| The driver's license is scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| They are issued a stick-on badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Now, if there is a situation where they don't have a license and someone comes down, I'm sure that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| But the protocol is that they have a license to get in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| That is the extent of that security system currently, and as we've said at TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| the hope is to improve upon that, which we would think would be a benefit, but it's the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| The public comes in, they have a form of ID, a license, a real ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| and they can have a person meet them and go throughout the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Go ahead, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| I was in the building on Wednesday, and I got locked out without my key, and they didn't ask for much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3334)|
| 0:55:43| They asked my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I told them, and then she went through my list and was like, okay, go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| So maybe there needs to be some more training with the security people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| because I have experience where you didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| And I will say that during the meetings that we had meeting with PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| they indicated that it's roughly 9 to 12 people that come to the AHA building now, and I just can't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| yes, I understand your point, Jennifer, of just, you know, making sure we're acceptable for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| but I can't – it's one of those things of, like, which one has the bigger list of opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| and I can't throw away the opportunity to really serve our districts with the mental health aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| and the funds that we're going to save for on the high end, 3,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| 3,000 people are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| I understand that, but the crisis that we have in our schools right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and where we're planning to redirect the money to is more important for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Ms. Founds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I didn't mean to quite stir all of this up, but I will say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| and let me go on record as saying that I have the utmost respect for Becky Duncan Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| Senator Massey, and Representative Dunn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| and I have probably very little doubt that this law will be passed as a safeguard to the Attorney General's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3412)|
| 0:57:02| But it does concern me that TCA Title 49, Chapter 2 changes the law for the entire state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3422)|
| 0:57:11| and I feel like it's being changed for one county, one entity, and one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| And maybe I'm just not aware of other situations that this would benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| but it – I mean, obviously you can't write Knox County and TVA in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| but it seems very specific, and it just seems a little overwhelming to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| that we would change the law for the whole state of Tennessee for this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| But that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| I think Ms. Owens-Light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Yes. I just want to clarify the $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| So we have a resolution that says that the sale of a school building should go back to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| but we're going to take that $6 million and put it into the money that the county is putting into the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3478)|
| 0:58:08| So that's not really coming back to the schools, if I'm doing my math right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| So if they were going to give us the $1 million a year for the upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| which really we shouldn't have ever been paying, and we have discussed this for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| we should have never been paying that $26 million over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| because what the law says is that the county commission will supply office space for the administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3508)|
| 0:58:37| We have discussed over and over and over that we should have never been paying that to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| So that $15 million, that's not a windfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| That's what we shouldn't be paying anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| We've lost $26 million over time because we should have never been paying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| So saying, yay, we've had this big windfall, I think that's very disingenuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| because we haven't had this big $15 million windfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| It's just the county doing what they should have been doing all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| However, they're going to subtract out $6 million for the sale of the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| So we're going to lose that $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| So that puts us down to just $9 million in our big windfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| And if you take that $9 million from the $26 million that we've lost in previous decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| we're still negative $17 million for this great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| And the fact that everyone is bending over backwards to try to make this thing work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| even so far as state legislators trying to change the law for one of their 145 districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3577)|
| 0:59:46| to put administrative offices in a federal building, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| Why is this so huge that all of these people are willing to go to such great lengths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3593)|
| 1:00:06| The fact that we don't know that is also huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3606)|
| 1:00:15| And if we go forward with this with no more actual information than we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| every one of us sitting here knows that we have not been told the truth tonight on at least one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| We know that that's not how things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We also know, because we have e-mails that say so, that that 9 to 12 visitors per day is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| We have e-mails that say it's up to 60 visitors per day that have been logged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| and that that is also not accurate because they just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| They don't know how many people go in in groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| They don't know how many people hold the door for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| They don't know how many people come with others and never show ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| They don't know how many people come in that side door with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| They have no idea how many visitors we have per day because the system isn't in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| We have some kind of protocol supposedly on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| but every one of us sitting here knows that that's not the way it actually works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| So we can't talk about those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| If we move forward with this, with all of this evidence we have in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| knowing that this is not currently legal, I hope every person in this county sues our butts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3692)|
| 1:01:43| Mr. Caldwell, would you like to address any of the financial issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| I think since day one, when we was working through the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| the intent was always for the $6 million to go toward the building upgrades to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| So that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| As far as the $26 million that schools has paid for the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| and we've worked through those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| that is operating costs like utilities and security and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| I think the A.J. Code says that counties must provide school boards with adequate space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| I think ultimately those expenses, though, from an accounting standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| gets charged back to appropriate spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| So like for the county, general fund would have to pay for sheriff's space, elected official space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3750)|
| 1:02:39| I think that is how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| And so I don't think this is any different than what we proposed from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| We need a second on Ms. Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you. We have a motion by Ms. Hill and a second by Ms. Babb for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| We're voting whether we are approving the MOU as attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Or did we have another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Okay. So first we're going to vote on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So we have a motion by Ms. Hill and a second by Ms. Babb on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3798)|
| 1:03:28| Okay. We'll do a roll call beginning with Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| I'm voting on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3812)|
| 1:04:01| Okay. Do we have any objection to the question being called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3841)|
| 1:04:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Okay. So therefore we need to take a roll call on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| On the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Okay. So we are voting on whether we're voting on Ms. Babb's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| No. We're voting on whether we're calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Okay. This is going to be an exercise in parliamentary procedure this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Ms. Coatney, we're going to start with Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3881)|

| 1:05:00| Okay. So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| So we are going forward to vote on the question, which the motion on the floor is Ms. Bounds' motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| which was a substitute motion to – would you like to restate your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Sure. I'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3916)|

| 1:05:23| of Knox County Schools' central offices to the TVA East Tower to defer the vote on the MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| until either the Tennessee Attorney General states the move is legally allowable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| or state laws amended to allow the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3935)|
| 1:05:45| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| So to reiterate, if you vote yes, you are voting yes to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| If you vote no, then we will go back to our original motion, which was to approve the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| Is that clear? Okay. Ms. Coney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Let's start with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3961)|

| 1:06:19| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Okay. So we have a vote of five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| Motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Now we will go back to the original motion, which was, I think, made by Ms. Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| and seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| The motion was made by Ms. Hill and seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| So we will do a roll call vote beginning with Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| We're voting on the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| If you vote yes, you're voting to adopt the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| If you vote no, you're voting not to adopt the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4021)|

| 1:07:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| 9F, approve resolution to increase Title IX management, create an administrative position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| of Title IX coordinator, and address outstanding claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| We have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| And I believe we were adding a discussion item on policy G331.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| We're all very aware of a suicide of one of the faculty members at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4069)|
| 1:08:00| It's a crushing type of event for all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| I had some conversations with the wife of Jeffrey Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4088)|
| 1:08:18| and I'm quite concerned about some things that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4098)|
| 1:08:27| Certainly, we're aware that his discussion of non-renewal took place some days before the suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4107)|
| 1:08:39| Without getting into some of the details that the wife revealed to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4119)|
| 1:08:53| I think at the very least we need to look at our process for non-renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| I think that we need to look at how that information is conveyed by the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4141)|
| 1:09:14| There's just a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| There's many people that are very touched, very moved by this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| and I think we need to review it thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| and make sure that we're not doing anything that would contribute to such a thing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4169)|
| 1:09:39| I would like to move this to the next policy committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| a discussion of this non-tenure, non-renewal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4187)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Ms. Fab, I'll refer to you for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Before we start with public forum, I will just remind people that everyone gets five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Please come up and state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| and also for those who have not come before, just realize this is a time for you to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| but the board does not respond back during public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| So I'm first going to call Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4227)|
| 1:10:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Todd Shelton, South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| I'm going to mention disparities in educational outcome, lack of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| and the importance of cultural competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I also just want to note I always enjoy seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| and hearing about the good things that happen in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| Sometimes I don't get to speak to them, but I just want that for the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| I was born and raised in Middle Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| and as I grew up I slowly became aware of a huge discrepancy in the different histories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| that people around me lived through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I'm still learning about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I also recognize that it was hard to get information and answers about the why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| and the how different people around me were treated different than I was treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| I came to learn that our country has a lot of good and bad history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Any country does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| And history is a really important thing because, for better or for worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| it's part of who all of us are in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Part of our history has to do with racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| which was brought over on the boats in the 17th century and is still allowed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| The word racism itself is, it's not about being a bad person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| It turns out that racism is bad for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| We are all about being what was handed down to us from the generation before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| and the generation before them and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| And that means the good and the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| The idea of democracy, that's a good thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| The idea of racism is not a good thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| I'm very disappointed and really angry about the ending of the cultural competency training contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| with UT that was ended last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I'm also really disappointed and angry that the decision was made during the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| without any communication with the school public and public in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| I first heard about it by attending a school board meeting the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| I know that the UT program got good reviews after the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| and at the board meeting in October, I was told it got good reviews after the second year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| I also know that there were dissenters, but the surveys came back as good reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| People in Stop School Push Out group and even other community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| have been meeting with the board members and district staff for two and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| about the disparities in educational outcome and the importance of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| Transparency was the key word that we all agreed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| when discussing policy and decision making for the kids of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| I don't understand how this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| It shakes my foundation in our agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| and I just don't understand it and I'm upset about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Going on with disparities, the truth is that we have an issue in our community that affects all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| and the disparities in educational outcome in our Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| everyone knows this, and some refuse to acknowledge it and some folks are suffering from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| The Knox County superintendent and school board even set this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| as one of the three main priorities to deal with in the strategic plan, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| Cultural understanding and cultural competency is a wonderful thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| and it actually helps us all use, it actually helps us understand our history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4460)|
| 1:14:31| and the history of the people around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| The need for cultural competency training was stated in the task force recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| as a tool necessary to have to do to undo the disparities in educational outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| Here are four well-known necessary elements in learning cultural competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| One is the ability to analyze one's own culture with its strengths and weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| Another is cultural competency is understanding the cultures of others around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| And one of the most important parts is to recognize the effects of cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| when they interact with one another, different cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| And there's also having knowledge about institutional cultural characteristics, like racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| Without an understanding of cultural competency, I'm afraid that so many of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| that have so much potential, like PBIS or restorative practices, will not meet their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| I'm also afraid that the disparities in educational outcome will continue and will even get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| So I'm hoping the budget coming up that the school board will include the staff necessary to make these programs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| We have met with Janice Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Thank you, Mr. Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| And so we look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| She has not got the staff that she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| She doesn't have the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| We have to conclude your remarks, but thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Erin Eglund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| Am I pronouncing that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Erin Eglund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Are they here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Next speaker, Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| Thank you, Madam Chair, for the opportunity to speak to you all once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| As Mr. Shelton just spoke to several different things, I'm going to speak to them in a similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4591)|
| 1:16:40| The first thing that we've talked about that seems to be, or at least we think it's important, is transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4600)|
| 1:16:49| And as Mr. Shelton mentioned a few minutes ago, we had that training that went on last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| and all of a sudden it was abruptly shut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And those of us in the public domain had no knowledge to that until after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| So that's not good transparency to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| We've been, you know, our organization, Stop School Push Out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| and several other organizations have been communicating with you all for the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| Stop School Push Out has been a little longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| And we're still having terrible problems with transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| So either we should say we're going to conduct reasonable transparency and leave it alone, or leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4652)|
| 1:17:44| The public that you all serve and the activities that you all are responsible for is for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4664)|
| 1:17:58| The public has a right to know what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, when you decide not to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| It needs to be clear to the public that you're stopping something for a particular reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| that culture training that Mr. Shelton talked about a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| we went through an awful lot of discussions over the past to get that in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| and all of a sudden, just like that, it's over and done with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| We didn't have anything to know about it until after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| And we had initially worked a deal that I thought was going to allow that to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| And obviously, that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| So let's be true to ourselves about what transparency is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| Mr. Shelton also talked about disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| I wasn't at that last meeting last month when that package was presented, but I got my hands on it, and I reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| And I want to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| It's a beautiful document, beautiful document, but the average person don't know what the heck it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| When you look at 14, 15 pages you have in here describing issues relating to middle school and high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4752)|
| 1:19:22| you say nothing about grade school, but there's a lot in here about high schools and middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| There's nothing in here about understanding what we're really trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4768)|
| 1:19:41| If we're looking at disparities over a period of time, why would we do a document once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4781)|
| 1:19:50| It's sort of like I'm only going to check the tires in my car once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| And when they go flat, then that's the only time I react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, if we're going to try to make some forward progress in disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| what we should be doing is presenting something to the public on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| Here's how it was last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Here's the progress as we've made this quarter, and here's the plan for the next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| When we come out with a package that's 15 pages long, and most of the general public has not even been involved with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4819)|
| 1:20:28| don't know what all them bright colors and charts mean in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I mean, you've got them labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I agree with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| But to understand whether or not the numbers of disparities related to minorities, people with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4835)|
| 1:20:45| and elementary school is not even presented in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| There's nothing in there about elementary schools at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| There's nothing that I can look and see and say, okay, last year versus this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| Why are we waiting a year to look at what we are doing to see if we're making progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| We should be doing that on a quarterly basis and then adjusting for the next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| And we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200302feb12?start=4881)|
