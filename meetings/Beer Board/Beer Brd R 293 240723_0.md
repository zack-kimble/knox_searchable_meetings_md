| 0:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Before we get started, a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| If everyone who's here for their beer permit can please listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| When I call the names of the businesses applying for the permit, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| State your name and address clearly into the microphone for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| You'll need to push the button with the little person on it on the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| If you get a permit that is approved pending final documentation, this is new to my script here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| it means that you have one or more requirements that are incomplete for a beer board permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| So that means you've been approved by beer board, but that's all you've been approved by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| and it's pending you getting other documents and requirements taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| One thing we've been seeing a lot of hiccups with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| and I think we have a handful of people that will be here tonight for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| is the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| If your application does not have your certificate of occupancy completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| I just need you to be aware that that means many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| It may mean that you need zoning changes, meet parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| submit architectural drawings to plans review and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| modifications to your zoning, your building, and your codes compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| It's a large umbrella of things under an innocuous term called certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| This may entail hiring an architect and or a contractor and submitting plans for your site review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| If you have questions about that, Mr. Johnson is here from the building department sitting up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| So if that is you, we want to make sure that you get the help that you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| so that you can get your beer permit and get your business in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| So I just want to put that out there to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Applicants that have their beer permit approved tonight and their file is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| they can pick up their permit at the end of the meeting from Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Finally, as I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making motions in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| So let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| We have a long agenda and limited time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| We're going to call off agenda items with complete files that have no records and approve those in a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| Mr. Bird, could you call those and we can vote on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=309)|

| 0:07:30| volunteers can do things like card people and other functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| but the actual service of the alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| the ordinance provides that it not be a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=458)|

| 0:21:27| Actually, we need permission to maybe postpone it for not the next billboard meeting, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| the meeting after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1293)|

| 0:21:42| And you guys have not been able to complete your file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| You're still missing certificate of occupancy and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| This is district two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| I don't know if Councilman Roberto has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I guess, how much time do you think you need to be able to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| You were saying you needed maybe until September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| We got a little snag because of permitting, because we took down the canopy and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| So we have all our permits in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| So it all depends on the contractor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| They said about a month, but I would request two months, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| What I'm going to do is make a motion to have this heard in the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And once you have everything put together, you can always turn it in early, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1354)|

| 0:22:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| And that way it gives you a little extra time, given that sometimes we don't know what contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| schedules might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| It gives you a little extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1362)|

| 0:24:23| How much longer do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| You still haven't gotten your plans reviewed or approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1466)|

| 0:27:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| That would be myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I came from our home office in Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1669)|

| 0:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| So for our Beer Board here, you guys, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| This recent is cited for sale of a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| It was the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| We have our options here are to refer to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| take no further action, so no motion, or postpone or defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| Mr. Spino, I have a question, and I don't see any of my colleagues' lights on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| So you guys turned in a remedial plan, and you have quite an elaborate serving plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| as well as details about how to sell product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| You can have the nicest, prettiest plan, but that doesn't mean that it is implemented by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| So what all training is happening so that your staff knows not to sell to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| I had my entire staff go through the MDC alcohol awareness program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| Any new hires, every one of my staff has to get certified through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| on top of our LMU online programs to get us so they are all aware of alcohol awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1752)|
| 0:29:23| Sorry, a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| On top of, what else are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| We got the IntelliCheck, so there are devices set up at every terminal that IDs need to be scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1772)|
| 0:29:43| No age discrimination, there is no age gap 40 or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| Everybody is going to get ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| We are in the process of taking the human element out of scanning IDs through another program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| that will eliminate any kind of error or ever have to be here again to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| It makes sure the ID is scanned on every guest check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| and it eliminates the entire human element error of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| On top of, what else are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Sorry, nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| So what Mr. Spina is referring to are all these programs that we do have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| and I do believe in the package that we submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| We have the, I didn't put the entire module in there because it was hundreds of pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| but it's a program that all of our folks who serve alcohol are taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| responsible alcohol service, signs of impairedness, of course how to read an ID or what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| As Mr. Spina said, we take all the effort that we can in order to take that human error element out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| I mean this young lady this night of this offense did actually look at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| She just miscalculated it by a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| I believe the birth date was December, and this happened in June, but it was the proper year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| So things like that, we try and do everything that we can to keep that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| The other thing that we're doing, and we've done this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| but we've taken it to a different level at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So we have another program that we're looking at that's going to go on our TOAST system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| We're still vetting the system out to see if it is any improvement over IntelliCheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| IntelliCheck came to us via a recommendation from the state alcohol ABC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| The state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| State of Tennessee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| As well as the top shelf programs that they alerted us to in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| So we're taking that extra level to see which one of those two programs is better to try and eliminate any errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1909)|
| 0:31:59| or at least increase the accessibility for these iPads to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Because we had several, but now we've added another six since this incident occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| hoping that that will distribute around the store more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| You've implemented another set, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Correct. We have six more iPads that we've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Six more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| That we've deployed. Or is it five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Six. And then also on top of everything that he's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| we have another program coming in with outside sources that they send their own people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| to see if we're actually being compliant with, you know, underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| So they'll go in, just normal guests, red card, green card, that we are actually not serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| You know, we are IDing everybody. We are not making this same error ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| And like all my predecessors before me and putting us in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| which is horrible since I've taken over this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I've changed the culture of this restaurant and I really, truly do care about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| And devoting my own time, tomorrow I'm visiting, I'm not sure if one of you, with community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| I'm going to volunteer my own time to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| I'm just doing whatever I can just to change the culture and not have this be an issue going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=1993)|
| 0:33:23| Mr. Spinas, when did you start at the store you're referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| I'm sorry, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| When did you start at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Okay, so you weren't there for the first sale, just for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| No, ma'am. No, this is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Okay. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I do have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I cannot see when people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| You should yell at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| You know, what concerns me here is we see that you were cited, or the store was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| I know you hadn't been there since before January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| but the store was cited for a third citation in a two-year period in August of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| Then there was an agreed order entered, and you've paid a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| And you had a 30-day suspension in September of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| And then in June of 24, you were cited for a second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| And so I absolutely agree with you in your efforts to change the culture, because there's definitely something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| And I think your idea about taking the human element out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| and I know this beer board has encouraged folks for a long time now to adopt the scanner system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| so that you take that mathematical problem out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| The challenge that I have, though, is this is a lot of citations in a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| So I don't feel comfortable taking no action or postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| So I'm going to make a motion to refer for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| and then let the hearing officer talk to you all about that, and you guys can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And I'm glad you're making efforts, and I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| But there's just a lot of violations here, and I just can't get past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Mr. Frost, what is the consequence of us taking no action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Can you remind everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Well, it's basically you believe that they have exhibited a plan where they won't get another citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2131)|
| 0:35:44| And which offense sends them directly to the revocation hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| If they received a third violation within a rolling two-year period, that would automatically get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| That's what sent them there in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I just wanted to refresh your course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Mr. Roberto, or Councilman Roberto, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Yes, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Call me whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| When you've made a motion to send it for a revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| are there any particular directives or anything we want to send to them in reference to their remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| I think that they do have a, like you had pointed out, Chair, they have a very thorough plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| My problem is more with the number of citations we've had in a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| and I just don't feel comfortable allowing for the chance that this will happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| I do think a fine is appropriate here given the number of citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| but I'll leave it to the discretion of the hearing officer to decide what to do with that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| But that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Officer Presley, I have a question, and I don't know if you'll be able to answer it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| I'm trying to dig through the report and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| The ID that was presented that was underage but the server miscalculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| did it have the direction, horizontal, vertical, like was it denoted as an under 21 ID is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| Yes, I have a picture of the ID here actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I can show it to you if you'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| The server that night took the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| She looked at it, and she told me I didn't scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Oh, you mean afterwards when the citation occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Yes, when I come in and it was citing her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| She told me she looked at the ID, but she didn't physically scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Now, this is the ID if anybody would like to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| It has the red box around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I don't know how we get the servers to scan the ID because if she had scanned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| even if she just didn't notice the box on the ID, the scanner would have told her she couldn't serve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| And you guys have the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| You implemented six additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| That's what the new program that we're looking at to prevent that from even happening even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| They have to ring it in per guest check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| So I have a question about that program just out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So will they have to scan it to be able to get a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Is that how it will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| They can't dispense it until they scan an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| See, if a server is required, if they see the red box and they're required to scan anything with a red box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| then we don't have to worry about a math error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| What is slightly concerning is the materials that were turned into us, the beer board, for your remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| were quite a lot about how to upsell and sell people more alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and that's not quite what we're looking for in how not to sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| So that is the bartender training guide on proper service and providing hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| So anything that dealt with alcohol service is what we provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| I wanted to make sure that that was all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And, you know, one of the bigger pieces of this is surely the fact that with Michael being in the location now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| and a lot more eyes on this on our end is the accountability of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| You know, Michael and whomever might be managing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| they will do their best to manage the staff and make sure that they're all doing everything they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| So it's unfortunate something like this did happen and has happened in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| but it's something that we do take extremely seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| We have a motion and a second for this to go to revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| Oh, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| I have a question before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I wanted to ask, I guess when you have shifts come in, is there any type of meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| Is there a huddle that, you know, you guys talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Or, you know, what does that look like if you have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Every day, twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| We have pre-shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| I go over our daily things and give them the date to look out for, you know, the 23rd of 2003, whatever it may be of that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2418)|
| 0:40:30| And just, you know, I beat it in their heads over and over every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| This needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| I D everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| No exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| And, you know, that's besides everything else we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And so do you tell them that in addition to the date that you give them, that they need to scan every day, that they should scan these every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| And so it's very unfortunate, something like this, when it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Because, you know, that means that there's an employee who now has a charge and alcohol has been served inappropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| So these are just the ones that we catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| So, you know, I appreciate all of your efforts and the information that you sent in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And, again, human error is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| I just think that there's a consequence when it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And it's not just with the employee but the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| It's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| So, you know, it's something that I'm really focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| No further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Will we be given some sort of notice about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| The city law department will file a complaint with my office and we'll be in communication after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Mr. Johnson will be your point of contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2521)|

| 0:42:16| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Edward Romero, 8520 Keystone Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| And just for the record, I surrendered the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| So you've surrendered your permit to Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Mr. Johnson or Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Mr. Johnson, has the fine been paid by the deadline prescribed by the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| No, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Has a remedial plan been filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| According to 4-78C1, the only choice is to go to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2573)|
| 0:43:03| Well, true, there is no permit, but they still might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| this gentleman might have problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| But I don't think you can avoid your fine by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| So the option for him is to pay the fine to avoid the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| 4-78 doesn't have an exception for someone who has turned in their business permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| It says if you don't pay the fine in the prescribed time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| and you don't file a remedial plan in a prescribed time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| they shall go to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Mr. Romero, Councilwoman Fugate has a question, but I just want to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| so you got the notice, you're aware of the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Yes, I got the notice the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Yes, and I'm willing to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| I just didn't have the time to pay the fines because I had to move out from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| so I did surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| That was on Friday night, 10 o'clock somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| You're talking about the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| What was at 10 o'clock on a Friday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| That was when the citation was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| That's when the mistake was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| So on Monday I came and surrendered the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| and then they served me a week after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| So I haven't had time to pay for the fine, but I will pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| Councilwoman Fugate, I just make a motion to send it to the revocation hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| because our ordinance says that's what has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| That was my motion too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2700)|

| 0:45:07| and you'll get notice of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2708)|

| 0:45:15| Mr. Frost, could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| I'm not sure how that operates, sir, after it's through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I'm not involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Ms. Dyer and the law department and Mr. Johnson here take the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2722)|
| 0:45:34| I would wait until hopefully something can amicably be resolved with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2741)|

| 0:46:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| My name is Hossain Jamani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| The address is 3215 South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Officer Presley, do you have any comments about the citation, the second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| I thought that might be a better way to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I don't know if you want to comment on the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| No, this was involving the same cadet that we had the idea out for before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| This was a sale inside a convenience store there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| The young lady behind the counter sold him a individual beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Mr. Jamani, you've submitted your remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| And does anybody else on the beer board have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| I will point out this is also the – Miss Council Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| We could finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Are you going to point out something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Oh, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Mr. Jamani, I read through your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| I think it's pretty comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Council, I'm looking at page 447.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| I am satisfied with the steps that you're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| I don't feel like they're superficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| I feel like they're pretty in-depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| I think there's been consequences for those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| but more importantly it looks like you've got a pretty rigorous process going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| and I think time will tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Now, both of these have been under your ownership, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I'll pause for a second to see if any of my colleagues have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| If not, I'll make a motion to take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| I guess we don't need that motion, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| No, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I think you've heard so far in the dialogue tonight about how serious this body takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| subsequent consequences, and this is under your ownership, so this is under –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| I'm a frequent shopper, so I'll see you soon, but please –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| I think you've got a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| If you implement it well, you should be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| Mr. Jamani, real quick question about the remedial plan guide that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| One of the things here says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| our back office point of sale system requires age verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| When you say back office, I don't know who – this is from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| Does that mean near the cash register or is it somewhere else further away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| No, back office is already connected to the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| They're supposed to check the ID and put the right date of birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| but there's a system where you just – they figure it out, the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| they figure it out what's the right – suppose if it's the 21 is the cutoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| to just do a sale, a lot of times they just do the right – they look at the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| but they don't enter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| So it's not a scanning, they're entering the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| You have to enter the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Right, and they're just entering a generic date to not have to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| and translate what they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Okay, okay, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| So that's an employee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| So it's not like they're not checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| They check the ID, but they take it and it's a human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| And we feel that just to avoid one extra step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| they figure it out what's the right number to pass this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| Am I making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Yes, no, I understand, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| So instead of entering and checking the ID, they check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| but they just enter what is going to make them not do that extra step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| and they'll just go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| That's what we found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Are you able to – sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Are you able to see that reporting so that if they enter the same date over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| and over you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Okay, so there will be periodic checks of that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Okay, yeah, that's included in here, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Wow, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Anything to avoid extra work, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| And we take it very seriously, and we have told them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| as you see it in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that now we're going to make sure that they're going to sign it where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| if it happens they'll lose their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I mean, we cannot take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| It's really serious for anybody who's operating a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| So Vice Mayor Smith is recommending no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Well, there's no seconding needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| There's no action, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| So, all right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| We have one last, which is 6D, and that is Hena Harbs Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3062)|
| 0:51:12| Is there anyone here from Hena Harbs Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| Nilam Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Yes, my name is Nilam Patel, and my address is 3001 Burnside Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| and my corporation is Hena NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| So this is also cited for sale to a minor, second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| You've submitted a revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| I don't know if anybody from the beer board, Councilman Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| I have received your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| There's ten suggested things on there to do to help overcome the lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| following the guidelines about sales to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| You've done some of them, but there's others that haven't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| I see you have required the servers and sellers to ID everyone regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| age, or at least you've told them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Since the citation, you've offered remedial training to your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| You have a company policy regarding the sales of alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| You do have POS software, according to the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| to electronically check, and you have signage posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| And all those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| But also I see where your business is not a Tennessee-responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3165)|
| 0:52:54| Your business hasn't requested underage drinking prevention materials through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| the Metropolitan Blood Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| All of your employees haven't received server training cards or training about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| how to properly check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| You don't conduct in-house compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| and you don't have an incentive plan for employees for confiscating IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| So I'm really, really concerned that the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| although you've taken some steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| there's a lot more that could have been done and can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| Yeah, sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240723?start=3219)|
