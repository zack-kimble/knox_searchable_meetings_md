| 0:05:14| I'm going to ask now for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| departments for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=316)|

| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Ladies and gentlemen of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Mr. Andrews, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| I'm going to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| approve this application, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| I understand you've had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| family circumstances that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| brought upon this ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| But this store has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| location where under 21 has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=353)|

| 0:05:59| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| That will not be tolerated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| There's nothing you can say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| next time you come up here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| will make me feel any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| about how you're going to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| If it happens again, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Do you understand what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| I can make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| First, I guess as a way of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| comment, Ms. Nash from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| health department, she's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Her father passed away last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| They're from Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| I know they went down this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| weekend to funeralize her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Just to let the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| To and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| And I have noticed, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| just an anecdotal comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| I mean, I'm not purchasing beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| But I have noticed a shift in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| professionalism and within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I will let folks know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| I do feel --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Please don't prove me wrong that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| you guys have gotten the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| And I really have noticed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| folks are just a higher class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| of employee, to be blunt about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| So hopefully these employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| are properly trained will do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| right thing when it comes to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| I would say you're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| touched over and over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| So do the right thing to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| You can go to bed at night and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| not even have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| So thank you for what I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| And hopefully we'll continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Any other comments from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| The last thing that I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| say is, of course, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| appreciate Mr. Siddiq's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| recommendation to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| something that we'll continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I think the ice storm delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| some of our discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| his suggestion about outlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| criminal consequences, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| in terms of fines and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| But that type of document might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| be helpful to the vendor, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| think, in terms of emphasizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| the severity of the types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| things that this would be, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| way the law looks at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| We'll work on that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| And then, of course, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| realize that what the board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| talking about is revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| They're going to revoke this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| license if this comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| That's my prediction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| If this was to happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| they're going to put the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| severe punishment on you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| But we appreciate your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=517)|

| 0:08:42| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=522)|

| 0:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=559)|

| 0:10:14| C-A-L-E-B-O-Y-E-R-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| And my address is 1416 Kenyon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Street, Knoxville here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| I am representing a small group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| of individuals that are planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| on trying to restore the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| sanitary laundry building that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| there close to the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| of Central and Broadway Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| It's kind of a blighted building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| that's had a number of break-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| It caught on fire a couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| ago and has just been sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| empty for, I guess, around 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| It has an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| contamination problem, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| been dealing with, been dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| with by T-DEC, and it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| But we are trying to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| funds together to restore this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| building and turn it into we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| been working with Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| to restore this building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| turn it into a community theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| space and an art gallery and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| art studio space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And in the research that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| done, I've found a Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| code that's, it's Code Title 67| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Chapter 5, Part 2802, that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| that blighted properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| have environmental problems can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| be waived of the interest and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| penalties on back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Now, we basically got donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| the title of this property by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| the previous owner that accrued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| all the back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| It's a long story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| He was fairly negligent, but he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| had federal taxes that are owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| in the sum of, like, $120,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| the environmental liens to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| order of about $110,000, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| then the city and county taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| that were around $140,000, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| well as just the damage to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| There's a lot of disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| The roof is caved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| It just needs a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| But we were just trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| out if there's any way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| actually apply that Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| code because we can't figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| But it's there, and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| know if there was any way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| any of our commissioners, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| McKenzie, I haven't really talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| to him personally about it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I just wanted to put it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| guys to see if there was any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| of actually applying that waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| of interest and penalties on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you, Mr. Borges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| We've got several that want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| comment, so just hang around for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Mr. Briggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Well, you sort of asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| question that I was going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| is, is there any way we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| on this because I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| everyone feels, but generally to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| try to salvage one of these older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| buildings that's in a blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| area is something that many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| You may have a difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| looking at the TIFs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| the tax incentive financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| because it's not going to be a ---| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| it's going to be more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| community building than it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| for-profit building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| But that's something you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| What I would like to do is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| give the law director's office a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| chance to investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| They would have to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| But to me, if we're just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| to let a building sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| empty because they owe taxes, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| me it seems like that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Ms. Royles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| This is actually my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| And I live within walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| distance of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| And definitely I'll get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| with you and the group and figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| out a way to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| I don't see that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| -- I mean, I think we would all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| be in agreement that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| building needs to be rehabbed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| And I think making it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| community space is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| So we can work with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| director and with the trustee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| And I see you guys pointing at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| each other back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| And do any of you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| The only thing that I'll mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| is that the city sold us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| property at the city tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| and Doug Gordon is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| And I mentioned to Doug that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| would encourage him to also meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| with you because he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Chad, name there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Chad Tindall, 10129 Elk and R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| But in any event, Doug Gordon's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| a delinquent tax attorney and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| sold this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| I know he's talked to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Boyers and I have, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| And I'm sure that they'd be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| to meet with you and try to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| if something can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| This is a property that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| very beneficial, just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Commissioner Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Let me get you my business card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| and you can call me and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| set up a meeting with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| So just to maybe add on to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| as to Mr. Boyers, that's --- I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| know with Emporium Building, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| know that that had a more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| public use at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I don't know if they got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| pilot or something from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| cities, but I'd say that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| might be too difficult of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| hill to climb, but that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| an avenue for you all to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I agree that a TIF is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| not the appropriate route, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| know the city may have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| other revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Can I make one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| This came to me as a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| If this is a not-for-profit, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| TIFs and those things, or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| pilots, may not apply because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| there's not taxes on not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Yes, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| I don't know how they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| to structure this, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| something where that may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| available if it's not a taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| What he needs to do is just get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| the tax liens or whatever taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| off, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I guess but the --- somehow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Emporium did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| So just maybe use that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| as a blueprint and that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| This is a building at the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| end of Great Gate Street that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| has a bunch of non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| cobbled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| So that might be an avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I don't want to give any false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| hope, but that may be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=961)|

| 0:16:03| I like the idea and the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I hope you can work through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| legalities that were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I'm just curious, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| federal tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Is it some guy's federal tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| lien?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| There's not usually a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| tax involved on property, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| It's the previous owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| personal federal taxes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| from about 12 years' worth of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| his income taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| So that would be between him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| and IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| I was just sort of indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| how much cost there is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| aside from the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| taxes that are sitting, hovering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| over the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| So that would have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| resolved at a different level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| and a different forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| We're applying to the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| because the owner has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| stripped of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| There is a way to get that lien| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| removed from the property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| just attach to him as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1011)|

| 0:20:58| was the funnest wedding I'd ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| been to. She was just terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1260)|

| 0:21:06| wouldn't go out catting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1266)|

| 0:21:12| going to be in big trouble. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1272)|

| 0:22:10| great. She got me involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=1330)|

| 0:33:54| I was in Seattle for the birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2034)|

| 0:34:20| somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2060)|

| 0:34:50| You can leave it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| In fact, I guess to be accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2093)|

| 0:34:56| the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2096)|

| 0:34:59| correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2099)|

| 0:35:02| I did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| It would be 901, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| It would be 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Or 8012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I'm talking about the count below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2110)|

| 0:37:11| Back in November or some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| ago, I had the idea that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| ought to do something better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| with Knox County's surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| property and selling it rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| than disposing of it just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| public auction for a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2239)|

| 0:37:22| to figure out a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| And we worked on that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2244)|

| 0:37:31| process last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2251)|

| 0:46:41| I hear a motion? I think what we had discussed was having a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| postpone this for 60 days to allow the parties to get together so I will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2808)|
| 0:46:57| that motion. Okay. Motion to defer for 60 days. Okay any discussion towards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| motion? Mr. Wright. I would ask to be informed of what maybe the background of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| this might be that we're looking for in the next 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| What I would anticipate is that we'll set up a meeting with the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2842)|
| 0:47:40| board as we agreed to do when we had contentious items and both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| items will be discussed. They're related of course in terms of their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| implications and that Ms. Carson and I will discuss here shortly and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| you'll be notified of that meeting. Thank you Mr. Chairman that's that's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| answer. Okay Mr. Hammond is that you or is that Mr. Shouse? Mr. Shouse? Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| Chairman I would just add to that it may be a policy matter the Ricky McLeod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| Amherst and Gibbs but it certainly just seems to be a matter of a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| interpretation about the Southwest Knox in regard to this S I forget the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| acronym but it's the bond that financed the South. QSCAB. QSCAB yeah QSCAB yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| and I think our attorney has if I recall I don't want to put words in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| mouth but what some of the advice he gave us a week ago was that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Southwest Knox if the title was transferred that it it possibly called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| the bonds I believe so that that's certainly a legal issue we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| resolve because bottom line it is a Knox County taxpayer is going to own this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| whether it's in the deed of the schools or deed to the county or they did to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| engineering department and that's kind of taxpayer it's gonna own it's gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| have to pay for it so anyway that's what I want to make sure we focus on is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| that the Southwest Knox situation. Okay so that will be as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| discussion when we're considering both resolutions those will be that'll all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| taken taken up in the process. Okay any other discussion of this item? All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? So it'll be deferred for 60 days and Miss Carson I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| alert the board as soon as possible about when that meeting will be. Okay we're on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| 11. This is resolution 801 a resolution regarding the transfer of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=2988)|

| 0:50:34| Yes thank you Mr. Chairman again my apologies for not being here on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| but I did have some questions that I wanted to address and my questions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| going to be around two aspects of this number one the deal what is the deal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| then the second thing is with regards to the people and the the patients and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| clients that are being served at Hillcrest so first of all Chris as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| understand the deal and normally you don't go over these things in public but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| this is a public transaction 5.2 million is what will be given to Knox County for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| these three sites in the contract what assurances do we have that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3070)|
| 0:51:21| to for example tear down the hospital the tuberculosis hospital that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| going to be making the improvements to the water tank etc etc I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| make sure and I don't need long explanations I just need assurance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| it's there that these things are going to happen and then what happens if five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| years from now they decide that they want to sell that property what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| at that point it's called well 400 Main Street let me start first with setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| with the ID be and with them with the members of Hillcrest we went over a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| things to answer some of these questions and one of this one of these items is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| the fact that you know it's appraised at 11.2 we're selling for 5.2 so we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| to toss the six million dollar difference to something so we tied the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| six million dollar difference to continuous care of the indigent which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| they serve currently 72% and also a an improvement schedule that goes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| water lines to either tearing down or rehabbing the old TV hospital to various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| improvements at other sites and there's a time schedule for them to meet these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| deadlines and then we also put a profit to hearing provision in there and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| that basically says is if you sell a facility and you make let's say they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| sell all three and it's 20 million dollars and anything greater than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| they sold it to then that money comes back to the county yeah would you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| over that one more time it's called a profit provision and basically if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| were to sell the properties at anything more than they paid for that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| so if they sold this property for more than 5.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| Chris Trump council ID me just one day so in essence they are permitted to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| a facility so long as it they satisfy kind of one of three different criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| one is they could they could sell facility to an entity who agrees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| assume all the obligations to continue to provide care to the indigent etc as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| set forth in the agreements and they could also that would be with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| county's consent okay in addition they could sell the facility as long as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| took all of the the proceeds associated that to build a new facility in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| region okay and let me you you said in the region it will in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| geographic area of Knox County okay where the where the they would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| build it where the beds are I mean they have to do it with yeah I wouldn't draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| that line for yeah the certificate of needs are tied to location as well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| area and then in addition they could if they did sell it just say everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| agreed that in essence there's a better use for this property and in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| agreed with that etc they went ahead and they sold it for more than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| they've paid for plus their capital improvements that they've made to it any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| excess there that that any profit essentially would come back to us as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| county so so basically the county is has the right of first refusal if they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| to sell that property that they have to come back to Knox County right it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| exactly set up that way but because they do have some permitted ways of selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| but okay now he's explained to me permitted ways of selling those three I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| just mentioned there which is I mean I've done a great job explaining but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| they can transfer it to someone with the county's consent as long as that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| person comes in assumes their obligation to provide care to to operate a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| term care facility in that same facility right but the key word to me there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| County's County exactly that is it's kind of a consensus not taking a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| of first refusal but consent so it's a prohibition on transfer basically unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| they satisfy one of these three scenarios okay the other is that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| have the ability to to transfer it and take all the proceeds and apply do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| basically have a new facility in the same geographic area of Knox County so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| again and there's no need for a county consent there it's just that's what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| have the ability to do that and then what you get that satisfies you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| again our requirements that that these facilities are used or substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| facilities are used for the purpose of caring for Knox County's seniors and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| indigent the the third scenario that is a permitted transfer is if they they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| transfer for any reason so long as they any excess proceeds you know what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| paid for it plus what they've put into it from a capital perspective capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| investment perspective the excess proceeds we go come back to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| to pay them back for this this this six million dollar price break thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| that that that leaves some of my some of my questions and the reason that I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| these questions is because when I was looking at the Hillcrest consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| statements that ended June 30th 2012 the way I read this the operating revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3398)|
| 0:56:46| from Hillcrest increased almost four million dollars from 2011 to 2012 their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| net assets at the end of the year was 8.8 million now if I don't get these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| correct make sure I want to make sure I'm factual on this so in looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| this if they get a piece of property or three pieces of property that are valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| at eleven point two and then you add that to your eight point eight then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| gets up to about twenty million now you've also got liabilities in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| because they're paying five point two so that's going to be included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| so you look at the numbers but I guess what I was looking at from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| standpoint is we've got and again these numbers indicate to me this is a well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| run organization this is not a negative thing I see it as well run I see it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| in looking at these numbers you can tell that this is an efficient operation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| that this is a well-run company and so I feel good about that I guess my only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| question was and this is why I was asking the questions about about Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| County's involvement is if we were to sell this for five point two and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| have improvements to the facilities then the value is going to go up the value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| that property will go up and so if they were to sell it at some point down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| road they could really you know get a lot of profit from it so the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| this has been addressed I like that and also from the standpoint of the care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| the people in talking with the people at Hillcrest they were telling me that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| not just seniors you mentioned the term indigent they have an individual there I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| believe that's thirty in the thirty year range all the way up to a hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| six so they're providing a need in the county that's vital and so for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| just abdicate that I had a little bit of an issue with but I don't see us doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| that I think that there is some safeguards here again I see them as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| well-run company I think that they're doing a good job I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| sure that down the road because of this transaction that we don't get ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| into a situation that we would look back on and say well gosh if we had done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| when we done the deal but it sounds like that a lot of these things have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| done I guess my bottom line is this is when you look at the fact that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| company increased its net assets by what three million dollars in one year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| you see their their operating revenues up almost four million dollars again it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| shows a well-run company but it says to me five point two and you you look the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| numbers this is a great deal for Hillcrest I wouldn't say it's a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| deal for Knox County I would say it's a it's an okay it's a good deal for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| County with the assurances that we have so I'm gonna vote in favor of this and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| appreciate your indulging me and letting me ask these questions because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| I feel a little bit better about the about the substance of the deal now I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| would point one thing and we talked about the Jew the Jew graphic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| limitations as it goes with the the facilities well what those limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| are is the Beverly Park has to be if they were to sell that and move into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| new facility has to be in what is known as Northeast Knox County if it's West it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| has to be in West if it's South has to be south of the river we put those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| there because we know how important those are to the community so we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| to put to say that you can't close the one in West and move it to North we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| wanted to put those in there to make sure that those areas are representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| and to your point about them getting a great deal yeah and that's kind of why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| we put in the six million dollars worth of improvements okay thank you miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Hammond mr. Shouse Thank You chairman I I'll try not to repeat myself from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Tuesday I when I first saw this deal I thought gosh it's a praise that 11 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| sell it for five looking at all the fact sheets that have been presented to us I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| think Commissioner Hammond pretty pretty fairly equitably not a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| it's it's a okay deal I guess but again looking at the numbers Chris gave us 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| million the fact sheet says putting a million in to clean up the old TB and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| asbestos etc which Chris said that was probably like three million they put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| 2.3 so I can come around to that that five million dollar figure I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| to say it's a great deal and get nine or ten million but I will support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| let me ask you a couple of questions though I guess it was Hugh you sent us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| about a 15 page document over the weekend and it's a good it's a good doc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| it's called a non-binding term sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3697)|
| 1:01:47| Hugh Holt 1000 North Central yes it's a non-binding term sheet basically it lays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| out the the basic premise for the deal that will be constructed by the IDB by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| myself Todd Napier and Chris Trump number two paragraph D long big long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3718)|
| 1:02:09| paragraph lower third of that paragraph Hillcrest acknowledges IDB's agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3729)|
| 1:02:17| set purchase price six million less than the aggregate appraised value and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| this discount is being provided in exchange for their covenant to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| improvements etc and it's too much legal lease for me that what or what or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| Hillcrest will pay the IDB an additional consideration to purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| amount equal to the estimated cost what happens if explain that last four or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| five lines there basically what that says if they don't do those upgrades or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| the difference between what they complete and the six million they got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| to write the county a check. Hillcrest has to write the county check yes for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| for the difference between the appraisal and the what we're agreeing between yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| between the investment and their actual work and the the six million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| okay you answered my question earlier about they can assign it with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| county's approval to XYZ healthcare with county's approval okay Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| will pay at closing all expenses of the IDB due diligence reasonable attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| fees is that gonna be much we're right now we're estimating around twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| thousand dollars okay okay that's I was hoping it wasn't a hundred or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| and lastly the look at 4d the county will agree to pay management cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3806)|
| 1:03:41| insurance costs other carrying costs related the property in the event IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| becomes the owner but only to the extent proceeds from the operation actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| collective IDB are insufficient to pay costs are we on the look for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| if that basically cash flow problems I don't know if the IDB's got cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| problems but that that's basically saying if the IDB has to take it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| over from Hillcrest that and and manage it for a I'm assuming a very short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| period of time because they're not in that business all right that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| that that anything if it's not covered by the revenues generated that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| county will make up the difference that's what that's saying if only if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| IDB on this very small window of time that they in theory own the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| not for 18 months when Todd or I know whoever might manage it I know it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| mainly a paper transaction putting the IDB in the middle of it it's right it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| providing cover for the IDB basically because they have a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| administrative staff and we we would underwrite them if there's a short and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| not Hillcrest correct it would be back Todd may here represent an industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| development board 17 Market Square the intent would be for us to if one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| these things events were to happen where the IDB was to retake possession of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| property our intent would be to be right here as soon as possible to transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| that back to the industrial yeah I mean to the county and and we want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| that up front that you are agreeing to take it back we we obviously do not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| to be in that business it's good business but we aren't going to work if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| everything goes as planned this this will not be a issue but that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| sometimes things don't go as planned but you know because we are conveying it it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| would come back to us but then we want to make sure that you're clear that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| intention would be to convey it back to the county I just wanted to make that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| make sure that we weren't picking up any shortfall for Hillcrest no thanks okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| thank you mr. Schultz mr. Smith thank you mr. chairman Todd could you come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| back I want to ask you a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Todd this 5.2 and yeah IDB board what I just think with it that we can get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| out of this are you comfortable with 5.2 I mean what give me your thoughts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| this 5.2 I have spent no time evaluating that amount I've just that was what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3970)|
| 1:06:19| presented to us through the mayor's office so I really can't speak to it we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| were asked if we could help facilitate this arrangement in a way that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| protected the county's interest you know moving forward in the in the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| but I can't speak that maybe Chris can Chris you know the 5.2 and one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=3993)|
| 1:06:41| why from the county side of things that we feel this is is a good deal for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| sides is Chris what for who came with 5.2 Knox County or Hillcrest it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| agreed upon amount so we kind of went back and forth a little bit okay agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| upon amount once Hugh Holt and myself took a tour of the Hillcrest facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and became known of the improvements that needed to be made do by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| language of the contract then we are required if we don't sell this to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| these improvements so those improvements could range from anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| between three and seven million dollars so what we would have to do is budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| for those improvements in the capital plan so that would be we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| issuing let's say six million dollars worth of debt and over the next four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| years we'd get four four dollars for so I mean now that we know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| improvements that have to be made if the sale to Hillcrest does not occur then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| are required by the contract to make these building improvements okay mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| Murphy can you come to the podium please while he's coming Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| appreciate your comments and I agree with you I had a lot of concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| you had my you might want to make a comment to you at this throughout this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| whole process and you've always been through all the years you've been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| professional and I've been sort of outspoken I think we can do a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| more but I'm to the point I'm not going to fuss and fight over it I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| could do a little bit better but I just want to let you know I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| for this in your favor today but I still think we could have got to me it's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| this is your first deal this is your first offer but let's move on the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| wants to sell it and wants to get that business and we want to get a liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| and as Commissioner Hammond also said you know you're running a good ship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| there you guys are doing good you're making some profit but I just think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| could have got a little bit more out of it but I'm not gonna hold up the boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| for that I'll be out voted on that but I wish you the best luck and you'll do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| good job for Knox County and our seniors thank you okay commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| any other questions comments all right and I and I just like to add just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| little bit to what's been said first of all the the Hillcrest Corporation has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| they've served this community for over 50 years and when we think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| health care of the injured indigent and and people that are certainly well along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| in years they've they've filled in the gap for us I anticipate they'll do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| for a long time in the future and that that's historically our what our what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| the our older members of this Commission and this community remember as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| obligation of Knox County to our community and they'll I feel I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| confident they'll continue to do that and I appreciate what they've done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| far and certainly appreciate the staff and Hugh what you all done in this this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| arrangement I think that we are safe as safe as we could be in a contractual way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| so thank you for that so the motion before us is to approve all in favor I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| posed I said page 14 other business discussion regarding the Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4200)|
| 1:10:12| Committee consisting of commissioners and Board of Education members okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| commissioners of course we've had conversation about committees that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| committee that was proposed quite a while ago was that we had a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| committee to deal with issues with it with the Board of Education the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| Education is offering to form this committee and ask us to join in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| formation of it with their forming the committee and and then ask us to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| part of it so I think that's a good way to go rather than us forming the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| committee we've got our committee this new committee finance committee which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| going to address a lot of the educational budget issues so it was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| thought that we could have four members and four members of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| volunteer four of us to volunteer to to serve on this joint committee so I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| mentioned it to a few of you I would and those are Dave Wright Sam McKenzie Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| Broyles and Mike Hammond so those are the people that said they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| available for service on this joint committee so that's our recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| or is there any discussion on this any further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| all right so what I'll do if there's no other comment miss miss Carson and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4302)|
| 1:11:55| will talk probably with within a few days I'm gonna be out of town next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| but it'll probably I'll notify the Commission the first full week of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| February as to what's going on with this joint committee we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| something something then mr. Brown question you've got four County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| Commission members how many school board members will it be well we're assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| they'll have four also okay they mentioned the first time we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| this there were three school board members my concern was that we got an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| even amount on both sides you know right I would I would expect they'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| four and I and I talked to miss Carson about that she she said either three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| four was a good was a good number oh well I don't I don't know about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4366)|
| 1:13:00| yeah an odd number as a vote I think it'll come more in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| recommendations rather than numbers so but Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| your faith and that I might work well in this and I'd also like to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| that's something that we commissioners talk about because I do not envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| this joint committee proposing anything that it's going to vote on I view it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| a group of commissioners participating in a committee and bringing findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| back to this body now I need to be corrected if that's not a good way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| look no I think that's that's that's right on right on the mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| miss right that these are recommendations we're going to we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| going to all as we do frequently we have a perspective about educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| issues that are different from the school board as they should be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| school boards as an advocate for educational issues and we're an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| for the budget of notch Knox County in the in the in the primary sense so so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| there's going to be some some some adjusting of views and so I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| that I think this body could serve that and and then of course our members will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| be bringing back be bringing back this information to help us make decisions so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| I don't think I don't again I don't think it's something that we're imposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| on by a vote as you said that's that's that's not the objective it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4472)|
| 1:14:40| information okay other other things related to this joint committee okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4480)|

| 1:15:43| today thanks thank you discussion regarding the double payment of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| related to the sheriff's department mr. Brown Thank You mr. chairman I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| to sheriff and also talking with Chris about this particular situation and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| handled in a funny peculiar way but it's seeming that the sheriff's department is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| renting a huge space downstairs which they have a lined off for some parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| places inside where they have some of the sheriff's department folks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| parking in there well they're paying for the space number one but those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| are parking in there are also paying parking space for parking in a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| that's already been paid for so that was my concern now Chris has a explanation I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| don't know whether that meets JJ's and my understanding of the situation or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| but the Chris if you will elaborate on that for us absolutely the last two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| fiscal years being fiscal year 2012 and 2013 no department has been charged what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| was known as space cost we pulled space cost out of each department's budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| put them into one line item because we had some misunderstanding of what space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| cost actually was you may recall people thought we were paying space cost for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| building that we owned it's basically for PBA management and utilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| things like that that's that was DVD out based on square footage but we pulled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| all out put it into one line item so no department the last two years has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| paying space cost and so it's kind of like this as far as the Sally port| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| parking Sally port the Sally port spaces in this total then and last with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| the current year budgets like 6.4 million dollars so that amounts in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| for the space for the Sally port just like the space for the parking garage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| in here as well so you know there is a cost for the management of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| facilities and so I think in the parking committee that we said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| wherever there was a parking space there was a cost because it's you know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| you're parking in the garage it's the same as parking in the Sally Porter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| behind the old courthouse so that's why they're they're being charged that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| they're not being double-charged because we did pull out space cost well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4718)|
| 1:18:46| that sounds good on one hand but when I look at it from another direction it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| looks like to me to be the same thing as if Sherry we took some yellow paint and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| strapped off a spot up there in her department and parked her motorcycle up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| there and charge her for parking there so it just seems like to me that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| beginning double-dip you know you had a motorcycle did you Sherry it I'm still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4752)|
| 1:19:21| just not clear on on if they're paying for that space how they use that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| should be their determination JJ again you want to add into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4768)|
| 1:19:43| name and address challenge 400 Main Avenue Knox County Sheriff when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| Commissioner Brown and I talked about this before I told him it's I have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| problem being an elected official with with paying my part to park the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| individuals that work in there are not elected officials there's no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| access from the public to the Sally Port so they are not taking up a space that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| the public would have a right to be parking in to begin with nor are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| using a spot downtown in the day in the lower parking garage so they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| actually in an entity that no one from the public can be in and they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| using a space in the garage itself and that's what I relayed to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| Brown and that and that's why he brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| how many spaces are actually parking spaces in that Sally Port there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| seven seven not counting mine we're going to charge you for yours I have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| problem paying okay mr. Brown do you have some other questions well I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4852)|
| 1:21:02| like to say that these six charges be taken off from from that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| department okay mr. Smith I served on the parking committee and and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| a part of it you know was the Sally Port that we discussed I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| anything about that people were parking in there in there for free and it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| lot of the supervisors and things like that and Commissioner Brown what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| what we came up with is that the people that park in in this garage somewhere in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| this building they should pay versus do I if I don't want to pay that and I work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4894)|
| 1:21:42| here do I want to walk five or six blocks and get here so are we gonna let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| these supervisors get to park for free and walk right into their door and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| the parking committee the people from all the city police and the Knoxville or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| the county they had no problems with everybody paying their fair share and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| the people that work in weekends and jails we even cut them their time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| half but this just makes it fair that if you park here you're going to pay to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| part versus I'm a supervisor or whatever and I get it for free I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| personally I don't is that right JJ now I don't know who you have parking there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| is a supervisor who's parking there they are supervisors yes yeah and the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| argument that I have is that there is no public access to the Sally it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4945)|
| 1:22:36| taking up a spot that someone else could be in because there's no access to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Sally but on the other hand to JJ don't they sort just walk right into their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| office right there well it's Sally port is connected to the building yes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| jail and to go right into the jail and into our offices whether I mean I'm see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| what you're saying and if I was an employee that's prime parking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| employees but they but that was designed initially for the transportation the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| safe transportation of prisoners right to unload fact that they have arranged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| their space where they can use it for this should be to their advantage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| not to the county's advantage okay mr. McKenzie I you know hearing this I tend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| to agree with Commissioner Smith in that I understand what it was initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| designed for it's not designed for that anymore so now we have the space it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| it's parking but it's inaccessible parking but you know when we asked our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| secretaries and our admins and our other folks to pay for parking to have close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| in parking and this is close in parking I you know when we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| supervisors or not I think you know if there's a space available in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| facility we should charge the appropriate amount so you know I what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| while I definitely understand the argument you know one man one woman one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| spot one charge per month it's it's kind of a that way if they ever open it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| and use it for logistical things in that's not from a personal parking spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| I'll see you know some some some changes to that but but for now you know I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| this was probably a hard decision for the for the parking committee to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| with but it's probably the fairest one that we could do but due to public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| safety that'll never be opened up for public access yeah but these folks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| getting a check and part of that check if you live down and work downtown not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| live if you work downtown parking costs and unfortunately parking costs and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| it's gonna cost those in this case supervisor he may change up and send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| other people that I don't want to say supervisors because who knows you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| what the future may hold but as long as this a person going to do their job here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| and not a business function of the Sheriff's Department I think you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5103)|

| 1:25:12| access to it Mr. Smith one other point Commissioner McKenzie you know there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| waiting list to get in we have employees that want to park here in this garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| and they can't there's just not enough room and I'm glad that they can use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| that frees up more room downstairs okay certainly this is a budgetary item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| Sheriff Jones is going to bring back in some form or another shortly so any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| comments questions all right thank you thank you Sheriff next item on page 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| report from the ethics ad hoc committee okay mr. dr. Briggs I thought what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| would do is give an update we've had two meetings now the ethics ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| of course there's no final recommendations that we're bringing back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| to the Commission at this point because ultimately it'll be the Commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| decides the the makeup of the ethics committee but one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| we're looking at and and some of the discussions have come up and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| really really got this started was how the members of the ethics committee are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| picked who sits on the ethics committee right now the County Commission gets to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| appoint people there the sheriff's office has an appointment the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| office has an appointment and also also the ethics committee itself makes an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| appointment to the committee and inevitably what happens is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| people that are on the committee are either County employees they're elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| officials in my case because I'm I'm the County Commission representative on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| there and also what inevitably happens is a lot of the appointees from either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| the County Commission of the mayor's office are people who either are former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| office holders or they have a close connection with the county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| and in almost because of the way this is done there's an inherent conflict of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| interest with that and we've even had some hearings of the nine members six of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| the nine had to recuse themselves and we only ended up with three voting members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| because someone either knew someone worked in the office with them and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| could go on and on is where because of the the courthouse connections is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| people felt that they needed to recuse themselves we looked at what some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| other some of the other communities are doing and one of the things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| considering right now and this is done in Nashville is that they take some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| the nonprofit non-aligned community service groups to are asked to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5263)|
| 1:27:51| appointments to their ethics committee and in those cases you end up frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| with members of the committee who really have no connection with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| government and who would be viewed as impartial for instance in Knox in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| not Nashville in Nashville the League of Women Voters makes an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| there's evidently two types of bar associations in in Nashville and so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| make to the two of the appointments and then also it's I don't recall what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| but to me it sounded like it was one of the labor unions they get to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| appointments sometimes they even reserve positions for former judges I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| if we need to do that or not we may have difficulty finding people serving but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| what you end up with is not an ethics committee that have been appointed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| different political bodies where there could be interest but you have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| that's pointed appointed by outside interest to do have an interest in good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| government who are making the appointments to the ethics committee the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| arguments also been proposed that you do need some of the institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| knowledge of people that sit on the ethics committee that understand how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| county government works they can understand what you know why some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| these conflicts come up and you would still need that input and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| completely eliminate that you don't have that and what we're looking at doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| letting either the letting the County Commission the sheriff and the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| office each appoint an ex officio non-voting member who would be present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| to answer questions and would be able to give input to some of the citizens that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| are sitting on the on the ethics committee on on on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| subtleties and and how the county government works and and would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| to serve as advisors but they'd be non-voting advisors to the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| committee and then finally on relooking at the recommendations for how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| charter how the charter would be drawn up for a new charter would be drawn up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| is to try to limit the the ethics committee to looking at what the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| legislature initially intended but did not but did not limit the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| committee to is conflicts of interest and gifts and just as an aside I sent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| memo to our chairman that the county human resources department does have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| training session that's given by human resources on ethics in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| government which they gave to the ethics committee and I thought it was excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| and maybe we could do that someday at the chairman's luncheon but you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| see why you you know what an ethics committee would do it also allows us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| see what's what other county employees are hearing so if we do see a breach of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| that it makes it very clear that they have had training in this now like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| said this is not final but this is where the ethics committee is right now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| we're throwing that out just for thoughts where the feedback could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| back through me or Commissioner Broyles who also is is is on that same ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| committee. Okay thank you Dr. Briggs. Mr. Wright. Thank you Mr. Chairman and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| thank you Dr. Briggs for the explanation of what took place in the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| meeting the other day. I'm not a member of that ad hoc committee but I was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| for something earlier I believe it was insolvency committee and sat through or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| listened to the citizen members of the ethics committee raise their questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| about what is it that they're supposed to be doing. I believe that your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| explanation went through some of the things that were taking place but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| believe the most important aspect of the ethics committee as we've been directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| to establish it by the state and this has occurred in our time so one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| few things that I can't say that's before my time. There's one commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| here maybe that can say that but I have to say we have I think we've sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| been in the dark a little bit about what we're supposed to be doing because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| school board has an ethics committee as you just said personnel department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| an ethics committee that's administered by the mayor's office I would assume so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| every time you say ethics committee we're saying something that lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| people can hear and interpret differently. The most important thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| think that we're looking at is that we need to look back at legislative intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| for the ethics committee that we're responsible for administering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| charter of and then beyond that the makeup of that committee. I'm open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| lots of things about how to do it. I believe I've heard there's been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| meetings where there would be a quorum but by the time everyone recused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| themselves for this that or the other then the committee was unable to act so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| there are two things that are facing us. First it's the legislative intent and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| asked the law director if he would assist you in taking to the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| committee that we're talking about the legislative intent that we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| under and then arrive at some kind of suggestions about how the new ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| committee might be established to make it responsive to the community deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| with whatever the legislative intent was and get us the new charter for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| particular committee to work realizing that it is not the end all do all be all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| of ethics committees. You know I think that's really some excellent points you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| bring out and I will compliment the law director's office. They did have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| representative there and we talked about it. I can't remember if it was you or someone else that you sent down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| Maybe it was David that was there that day. But we did go back and look at that and again I think they were dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| mostly with conflicts of interest and gifts. I think if we really have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| training program that the human resources department gives, it really clarified for me a lot more about what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5674)|
| 1:34:43| really talking about and about the type of problems that the ethics committee would be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| And I won't go into any examples just because of the time constraints, but it really helped me to focus on what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| really need to be doing and the type of complaints that would be coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Because sometimes in the past I think it's really gone way beyond what any sort of intent where we were almost doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| criminal investigations and we are just not prepared to do some of the things that have come up in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| But I do hope that we could get that on the chairman's agenda sometime in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| It was a very, very good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| And I think you'll understand after we do that what type of problems and situations would come to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| And yes, Jolie has already noted that as a request we'll be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| Mr. Law Director, did you have any other comments regarding what's been said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| I think we've got some support for the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| And I think Dr. Briggs actually expressed what the legislation intent was in his conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| And most of that has to do with financial relationships, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| And I certainly concur with you, Dr. Briggs, about the role of the committee getting a little bit beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5758)|
| 1:36:08| where they should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| There were certainly some very uncomfortable and just unreasonable things that were required of members of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5770)|
| 1:36:22| And it was caused by a misunderstanding of what their role is, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| So thank you for working on that and the time you're devoted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| Okay. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| Okay. Mr. Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| The audit committee met 13 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| We had a-for us it was almost a marathon meeting, three-and-a-half hours or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| And I welcome Commissioner Brolls and Wright to correct me or add to anything that I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| in this brief review that I will give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| We discussed the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| That's something that's been going on about a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| But we are in the process of expanding that from just general county employees to school employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| and I believe sheriff's deputies also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| That is somebody-it's a fraud and any improprieties that someone may see or think they see or aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5837)|
| 1:37:28| they're encouraged to call this hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| It is an anonymous situation or an anonymous process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| And Mr. Jones works on that along with primarily Chairman Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| They go through and the law department's involvement and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| Oftentimes it is, quite frankly, trivial things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| I mean, somebody was smoking a cigarette in the improper area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| I mean, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| There have been matters of substance and, nevertheless, we're expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5875)|
| 1:38:04| Some good news for the county's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| We went through the CAFRA, the county's financial situation, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| The county's debt is actually down $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| The county-we have issued debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| To give you an example, say we've issued 14, but the debt has declined by 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| So it's a net of $22 million less on the books now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| The unassigned fund balance-now, the actual fund balance is in excess of $100 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| and we all got excited when we heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| But more than half of that is assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| It's debt service and it's bond funds that are here and not yet spent, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| The actual unassigned fund balance when the auditors closed their books was $46,300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| Now, that's like your checking account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| It changes every day when checks come in to be processed or hit against your account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| and you make deposits on the other side of the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Is that a June 30 closed book date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Because that's what we've always used as a reference in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| So that's an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| It's an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| School activity fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| That is-that's been a burr in the side of the auditors since I've been on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| which is, well, three or four years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| A year ago, there were 40 school deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Now there are only nine school deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| This is a thing that's-there's probably always going to be problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I shouldn't say be pessimistic, but a lot of it revolves around athletic events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| and controlling the cash box at a high school football game or at the concession stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| I mean, there's room for-I'm not accusing anybody of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| There's the same room for money to not hit the proper cash drawer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| and there's maybe, you know, not an exact accounting of the cups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| and the Coca-Cola's are filled in and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| But nevertheless, that is something that these auditors are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| and there has been improvement in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| We found that some of these things are trivial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Some of these were issuing receipts from just a general receipt book that you could buy at a Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| I mean, and so you and I could go do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| These things were minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| The-I guess the largest event, the one that, of course, got the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| was some discrepancies in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| There had been a $2.5 million improper accounting of investment income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| This dates back to 2005 and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| A million-six of that has been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| But let me emphasize, no money was stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| This is a huge amount of money, $868,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Investment income was accrued but not actually earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| Now, that's a huge amount, and it's hard to understand that much money being earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| Basically, it was a double-booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| 2005, 2006, and 2007, when you could earn something on your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| To give you an example, we now earn, on our idle cash, that $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| I mentioned we earn between 33 and 50 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| That's one-third to one-half of 1% on that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| It has to be in super safe investments, CDs, treasury bonds, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| So turning the clock back four, five, six years, you could earn 2% or 3% on your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| So nevertheless, this was an accounting era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| and the auditors said it's an accounting era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| It still surprises me that KPMG, our previous auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| didn't find this and bring it forward to be corrected earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| It will be, the effect of it, it will, when it is, which it will be accounted for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| Chris, am I right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| It will be, hit the books this year, that will lower our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| The $800,000 hit in the CAFR, so it's already been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| It's already hit the books, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| So it lowered out your bottom line to the black by $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| And the additional $500,000, which was a different issue together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| that's the one that's going to hit the current year that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| The $500,000, Chris is mentioning, $522,000 adjustment to cash was a grossing up or netting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| of various clearing accounts and reconciling accounts between the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| and the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| It is, the biggest complaint from the auditors, the outside auditors, period company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| was that it took, it hadn't been reconciled before now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| You want to comment on that, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| I mean, I was shocked to hear it, but there are literally thousands of transactions hitting these accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6169)|
| 1:42:57| and they were not reconciled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| And, Chris, while you're doing that, put that in layman's terms, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| That's hard for me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| The $800,000, let's go back to it for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| So basically back in 2007, maybe 2006, I can't remember exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| we went to a new accounting software, and the finance department was booking investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| or revenue from investments, and so was the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| So at the end of the fiscal year, once it was realized that we were both booking investment revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6214)|
| 1:43:43| 1.3 of the 2.1 was corrected, leaving the $800,000, and that was going to be corrected the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6223)|
| 1:43:51| because that was an amount that wasn't material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| But then the next year it was forgotten, and then it was forgotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| and then so when we located it this year, we said, okay, let's correct it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| We've got to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| So we went ahead and booked that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| We didn't find that until very late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| It was found in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| So instead of doing a prior period adjustment, which would have been showing it up in probably 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| we just showed it in current year of 12, and then found the $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| We asked the auditors, could we also book that in next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| Because we don't want to go through and redo all the statements because it's 1st of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| and we're running out of time, and neither amount was material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| So that will be a reduction in this year's fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| And that pretty much sums those two entries up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And as far as the finding goes in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| it's an issue that Dr. Carsello met with the trustee's office about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| And along with us working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| we have come up with what we think is a corrective way to, going forward, make it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| and make that issue go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And I think Dr. Carsello would ask Pew and the company to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| and check those bank corrects for the first few months, make sure things are going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| If that goes well, then I don't think you will see that finding on next year's annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6320)|
| 1:45:29| Ed, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Yes, sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Is he saying then that, like, three years, five and eight hundred thousand every single year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| No, one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| It's one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| The 800,000 was one year, and so it took five years before it ever came back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6339)|
| 1:45:48| And that's when we went ahead and booked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| The 500,000 basically revolves around clearing accounts, which basically is, okay, it's a wire account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| So I'm going to wire some money to pay for some of our bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| And so we put the money out, and it's then the company will reach in and pull that money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| So it should always sum to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Those accounts were not summing to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| So it's kind of a reclass more than anything on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| But it's only a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| But you're on it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| I think everything's fine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I think everything's fine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| I mean, I think they talked at the meeting, and they felt comfortable with their response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| And I think everything is going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| And not to pass the buck, but this was a previous mayoral administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| and a previous trustees administration when this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| It just hung around longer than it should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| I've had conversations myself with Mr. Skinner and Mr. Duncan in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| and they assure me they're working with you have to work with Chris's office to resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| because it's the two different staff from both offices that have to get it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| And, again, I emphasize it was not, and I mentioned we talked about this at the audit meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6419)|
| 1:47:06| and we've had problems in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| We had the gentleman who padded his payroll by, what, $100,000 back four years ago, whenever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| This is not a situation of somebody stealing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| It's an internal bookkeeping era that the bottom line, it hits your bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| It made us have over $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| It looked like too much money a year or two, three back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| and now we're going to take the hit on it just to even the books, if I put it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| That, I guess the final thing, we had a little bit, there was a little bit of criticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| at some of our internal offices here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| The Register of Deeds and the Clerk and Master had some, I think, dual, more than one clerk using the same cash box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| The Register's office assured us that the personnel would no longer be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| If you have multiple people taking cash in and out, well, he did it, she did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| You know, you could see how that could develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| But Sherry Witt's people and staff were there to say they had segregated those duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6486)|
| 1:48:14| and along the Clerk and Master, he has a smaller staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| but he also said he would have segregation of duties so that wouldn't be another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| And I do feel confident that the staff in the trustee's office, along with Chris' staff, will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| this won't be a recurring thing because these auditors, they're on their toes and they'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| It'll hit every quarter or hit the CAFR for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| And I don't think they want to be dragging that into 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| I welcome any questions or comments from my colleagues on there, Amy or David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6523)|
| 1:48:54| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| I could say one thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| Something that Dr. Briggs is always interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| He mentioned the amount of fund balance as a cumulative total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| As far as just the general fund, our unassigned fund balances, which is the one everybody is always interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| we went from about $43.5 million to a little over $46 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6554)|
| 1:49:21| That's a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Discussion regarding the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| Okay. Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| Batter up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| You want me to throw you a high, fast one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| We'll knock it out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| A couple, three years ago, we talked about the need for a safety center, what it could save the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6590)|
| 1:49:58| what it could save a lot of individuals who sometimes fall off the wagon one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| and by virtue of keeping them out of jail, maybe being able to get them back on the right path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6604)|
| 1:50:14| the virtue of having a place where that if they went, for instance, to the Helen Ross McNabb facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6614)|
| 1:50:25| their insurance or their TennCare or whatever would pay for it versus what it costs us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| Every time that the county has to send somebody over to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| or whatever pills we dispense out there at Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| a month or so ago, J.J. and the commissioner, I don't know from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6645)|
| 1:50:56| J.J., if you want to come up and kind of give them the details on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| got together with Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| The state is now ready to help us do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| but we're at a point where if we don't do something now for the take care of the short-term basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| we're going to find ourselves in the next couple, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| going out on the bonds for $27, $28 million for a new pod out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| You all get the report every month on how many prisoners we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| It's to the point right now where J.J.'s office and Randy Nichols' office sits down weekly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| and says, Okay, who's the least offensive that we can let out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| so we can have room for some of these others that we know are going to be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| So that's kind of the predicament we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| J.J., if you could enlighten us as far as what discussion has been taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| And I think we're at the point where we can possibly, before budget time, get something in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I think we are to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| We've got a lot of players at the table that we didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| We've talked to the city mayor, O'Haro, also the county mayor, Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| We've talked to Commissioner Varney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| It's the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| And what I was assuming the next step was was maybe having some kind of joint workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| between the county commission and the city council where it could serve as a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| maybe to get the community involved to let them know where we are moving to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| And we would certainly like to get this addressed before this next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| And Commissioner Boyles has been very helpful planning meetings with constituents in her district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6765)|
| 1:52:54| and community where the location of this safety center would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| I think we have a date for the next meeting, for a meeting that we're going to have with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| that maybe she wants to elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| But I think now we're to the point where we need to start getting groups involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| and having some public input because the time is right for this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| And we don't want to let this go by, this opportunity that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| I think it's taken some three and a half years to come to the position we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| And things are really looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| So I think we need to make sure that we get everybody to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| so no one can say that they've been left out or their ideas or feelings were disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6819)|
| 1:53:46| So I think that's pretty much where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| One point, a key point I think, J.J., to bring back up again is the fact that three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| there was no state money or involvement behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| It was strictly we're looking at going out on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| But right now they are willing to add some help and put some money in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| And same way with the city government is also at the table also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| And this is just an opportunity that we've not had in the last three years of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6854)|
| 1:54:21| So I think now we should seize this opportunity and listen to what the ideas are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| and what people have to say and see if we can't push this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| It ultimately will no doubt save Knox County taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| And it will also get these individuals that don't need to be in jail the help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| and the treatment that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| I have been working with J.J. and with Andy Black from Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| talking to them and having meetings about this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| And I'm not quite as optimistic as they are about the state putting in money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| I hope that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| But I kind of believe it when I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| But we do have a public meeting set up for 6 p.m. on Tuesday, February 26th for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6914)|
| 1:55:24| and it's going to be at the health department in the auditorium there for anyone in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| who wants to come and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| There will be people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| J.J. will be there and people from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| And, of course, I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| I've already met with Mayor O'Hara and with the vice mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| Today I talked with Mark, who are the city council person who represents that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6943)|
| 1:55:54| whose name I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| Mark Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Mark Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Not enough caffeine today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| I talked to Mark Campin today, and he and I are setting up an appointment to meet and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| And I've also heard from Nick DeLaVolpe, who represents an area close to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| and have asked Nick for a meeting, but he and I haven't worked anything out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| And I have been a supporter of the safety center from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| I've served on the justice committee that first floated this idea a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| There are several people in the area who are not, and I'm talking about residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| who are not happy about this and who are going to be very vocal in their opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| And I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| I do hope that there will be an opportunity for people to listen calmly and have concerns aired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| and to receive correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| What has concerned me a great deal is the amount of misinformation that's been put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| about what this safety center will do, what it is, and how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| My biggest concern, other than the state actually coming through with funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| is the fact that there is still not anything in place to support these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| between their release from the safety center and the time that they will get hooked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| with their first appointment into whatever program they're going to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| We all know there aren't enough beds available in residential facilities for people who need A&D treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| for people with severe and persistent mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| And they will go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| I won't say they're going to go out and into the streets of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| because I've made sure that that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| But they will be out on the streets again until there is a place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| So we are still missing what is, in my opinion, one of the most critical pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| which is a safe haven for them between the time they're released until they make that first appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| And this is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| We don't have anything in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| When people are released from the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| they're brought down and dropped off right here at the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| And that's what's going to happen when they're released from the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| If there is no one for them to go, no place for them to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| they will be brought down here and dropped off in front of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Of course, that's better, a whole lot better than being dropped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| and turned out the doors of the ER up at St. Mary's right into the heart of Oakwood Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| because that's what happens right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| So that's going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| So that's a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| But we are still missing that critical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| And I've had a meeting, actually, with Jenny Weatherstone last week at VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| who is very interested in trying to find the funding and work to try to develop a safe haven program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7115)|
| 1:58:43| where these people will have a place to go when they leave the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| They will have a safe haven to go to where they can remain until there is space for them in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| or until that first appointment, which will probably be, you know, a week, ten days out from when they're released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| So this is not ‑‑ I think this has the potential to be a tremendously beneficial thing for our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7140)|
| 1:59:10| and especially for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| But there is going to be some opposition that's going to be vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| So I think we should be respectful and we should listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| But we should also try very hard to make sure that the correct information is put out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7160)|
| 1:59:26| about what this is and about what this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| It is not a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| It is a mental health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| And there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Thank you, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| I, too, am very much in favor of this safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| And I guess two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Point number one is I believe we've had some discussions about putting it in the budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| Chris, is that still the plan to ‑‑ I mean, whether we get state funding or not, is let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| And if the city is looking at it, too, and they're willing to put in some funds, let's get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| And if we can go ahead and put it in the budget for next year, then we can go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| What in our ‑‑ in the discussions with the sheriff and the mayor and the D.A.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| we talked about I think the state is very interested in the city and county both contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| So I think our first step is to construct the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| So we would put a certain amount of money in our capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| and the city would put a certain amount of money in their capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| probably anywhere between $800 million apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| The next step and probably the first step is we're going to have to bid out the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| So the Helen Ross McNab piece will have to be bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| He will conduct that and the winning bidder will be a part of the quote, unquote, team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| We talked about possibly getting in this year's budget also a portion of operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7247)|
| 2:00:55| The state has indicated that they are very much wanting to do a tri‑party partnership with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7255)|
| 2:01:03| and the city along with them at least for the first three to five years probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| So we would third that cost probably about $600,000 apiece if it's thirded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| And so maybe we'll do that like the final quarter so it won't just be kind of getting the facility done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| and then getting operations going and then have some sort of agreement in place with the city to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| okay, after the state does pull out, you know, here's going to be the partnership going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7287)|
| 2:01:35| is we're going to half the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| I think there has to be some sort of agreements in place so nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| so neither side gets stuck with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| But I do think the plan currently is for both city and county to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| at least the construction piece and the five‑year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| And if we could also take a look at any potential savings down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| because one of the reasons we want to do this is to relieve the overcrowding in our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| But Commissioner Burrell has raised another point and I've had a very preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| and I stress very preliminary discussion with Dr. Buchanan with the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| about mental health services that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Now, of course, you know, when you start saying analyzing, that says to me, oh, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| we've got to spend more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| That may not necessarily be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| It may be let's look at services that need to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| Are there people and organizations providing those services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| And are they coordinating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| They may already be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| I don't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| But I think that we have to look at that piece of the puzzle, too, is, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| safety center, they're there for three days, whatever that time is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| They're released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| What happens next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| And I think that we also need to start looking at that aspect of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| But in terms of just the safety center, I just want to make sure we were on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| with let's get it in the budget and let's have this discussion and debate moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| because I think it's something we need to do and do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| And just so you know, the sheriff and I had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| And he ensured me that after a couple of years of this gets going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| we can look at his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| And if there are savings, he said we can have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| And I said, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| And somebody also brought up the point, too, and we've got to get with Dr. Buchanan on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| But this also may lower the cost of indigent care with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| And so we provide, I think, $4.5 million or $4 million a year for indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| So that may be able to be lowered because that should reduce that cost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7402)|
| 2:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Chris, you just brought up a good point there in the fact that I'm assuming from what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| said that if we have prisoner ABC out there now and we have to take him over there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| UT hospital, that that care comes out of that indigent care fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| I would defer to Dr. Buchanan on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| But that would be my expectation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| You thought you were going to get out of here without talking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| And you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| If we, if the hospitals did not agree to bill the indigent care program for the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7449)|
| 2:04:17| they get, it's a crazy calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| Don't ask me to even go there, how much money we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| But it depends on how many people are sticking their hand in the cookie jar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| If more hands are in the cookie jar, less cookies go out per hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| And that's kind of how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| That's the simple way I can understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| So yes, we do pay for that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| So that just brings up the point that this is not a simple issue to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| There are so many parts of it that are going to have to be working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| The health department, you know, whether it's mental health or whether it's regular doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| help, whether it's this, that, the other, everything is going to have to be dovetailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| together to work to make this program right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| And Ms. Broll has to answer one question you brought up a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| From what I understand, if Brad's out here and every Saturday night he picks up old Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7513)|
| 2:05:22| because Joe's a habitual drunk, Joe is not going to be one of these guys who necessarily is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7522)|
| 2:05:30| to go out here because Joe is not he's you hate to say something like this, but some people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| to the point where they're practically beyond help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| We'd be wasting the money, the time of the folks at a facility like this to work with somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7541)|
| 2:05:49| They need somebody that's deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| What they're going to be working with are the less violent, the less criminalistic types that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7551)|
| 2:06:03| coming through on drug and alcohol programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| No one who has been accused of any kind of violent crime would be eligible for the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| And I know that this is another conversation that I want to have with Andy Black and with JJ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| is how many times do we offer assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| You know, somebody who gets picked up for public intoxication and taken to the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7587)|
| 2:06:34| and they're put into a program and they either don't comply with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| I think at that point they are picked up and returned and go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| So they aren't given just it's not a merry-go-round where you can just go in as many times as you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| There will be a point where we say we have tried our best to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| If you are not willing to accept that help, you will spend time in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| That's why I said that this program has to all be tied together where the right hand knows what the left hand is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7621)|
| 2:07:13| and everybody along the line so that we're tracking these folks and seeing what kind of progress we're getting out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| Are they habitual to the point where that we don't have any other choice but to lock you up out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| Well, I also want to make the point that this isn't only for the mentally ill who are being picked up and taken to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| This is for all of our communities, mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| We have the crisis intervention center, which has been in operation for, what, two years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| And do you have the numbers of how many people have been helped through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| The numbers are staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| They are staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| And it's a tremendous, tremendous benefit to our community's mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| And this is going to be a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| It's not just people who are picked up for jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| This is going to be this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| Like I said, it's not a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| It's not a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| It is a mental health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| And this program is available to every citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| And that's a great point you bring up, because when you say 16 beds or 18 beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| that sounds like such a low number of people that can be helped with this type of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| But it ends up being 4,000 to 5,000 people a year that ultimately go through this process and go through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7701)|
| 2:08:29| And Commissioner Brown, you may bring a great point, too, that this has to be everyone working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7709)|
| 2:08:37| like the hospitals and the intensive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| At some point in time, we want to go to the hospitals after we have a handle on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| and see how it works after a couple of years, two to three years, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| look, look at the savings that you all are getting from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| Now, we would like for you to contribute to this and help this program continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| So there's a lot of things that we want to look at after the program is up and running for a couple of three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| to see whether or not what we're doing is of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| And, you know, and hopefully it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| If it's not, then we need to look some other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| But we believe and everybody believes that does these types of things for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| that this is going to be a good investment of taxpayers' dollars and not only for taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| but for the people who need this type of treatment that they're not getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| I don't want to not repeat what's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| The concept of, I think Chris said, 800 to 1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| And, okay, if you're looking at that on the capital, and I know it's next to impossible to quantify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| but the debt service on that should be able to be realized from lots of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| what Dr. Buchanan talked about and hauling people to Maloneyville and just savings in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| And it's much more appealing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| I like the idea when we all went out to the jail facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| J.J. had us out there a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| But if it's at least one other partner, that being the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| and possibly two other partners, that being the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| I mean, the numbers just work so much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| And I get very unexcited if I hear talk about a $15 or $20 million bond issue for a pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7828)|
| 2:10:36| I mean, I don't know about you guys, but that doesn't get me excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| I sort of run away from that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| Like our pension obligations we were talking about this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| Anyway, I like the concept, particularly when we get help from other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| It should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| And I think the state and the sheriff's talked to the commissioner more than anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7850)|
| 2:10:57| But I think they're really interested for the city and county to show a partnership in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| And if that happens, then I think we're well on our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| And then how long the state will pay a portion of operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| you know, I'm not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| They've not really said for a set amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| But let's say it's three or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| That's $600,000 a year from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| If you say five, that's $3 million over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| You know, it's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| And maybe it's something that they would continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Maybe we can be a model for the state to enact it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| because we know with the closing of Lakeshore and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| there are some things that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| I have, I don't have here as much as Commissioner Brawlsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| but I do hear from some constituents in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| And I've heard both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| I've heard, not out here, we've got enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| And I've heard, yeah, it would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| Let's support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| And along that line, what time is your meeting on the 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| At 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| I'd like to revisit with Chris again this bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| You had mentioned the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| We've talked about Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| So there's no guarantee that Helen Ross McNabb would be the beneficiary, I mean, would operate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| I mean, it's in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| They're obviously going to bid, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| So in terms of where it would be built then, I'm looking at procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| Let's say that we were to decide this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| We want to appropriate the capital funds for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Then the next step would be where would it be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| How does that go with the person or the organization that wins the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7948)|
| 2:12:38| Or explain to me how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| I think the reason that Helen Ross McNabb is involved is the last time that bid was put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| they were the only one to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| So if that's still the case, then it will, of course, go to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| As far as the location, that's something that we have to work out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| Because you will have a building that is paid for with city and county tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| possibly on private land, which will be owned by Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| So we need to work through some legal hurdles there to make sure that that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| If not, maybe we get it to where that portion of the land is deeded over to the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| But we can work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| But I think the plan currently would be if the winning bidder is Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| for it to be built on the Helen Ross McNabb site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| But we would first go through and say it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| Let's appropriate the money for it, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Next step would be, all right, who gets the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| I promise it won't take you as long this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| Just keep in mind that being proactive is a whole lot better than reactive in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8029)|
| 2:13:59| It's taken such a terrible instance as Sandy Hook to make people in this country realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8039)|
| 2:14:07| that several years ago the government made one huge mistake in opening up all the doors to Lions View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8047)|
| 2:14:15| and turning everybody out and says, okay, everybody's got an equal chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| Everybody cannot handle an equal chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| Everything has to be handled on a case-by-case basis by virtue of dovetailing this program together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8062)|
| 2:14:30| where it can be incorporated into some mental health issues and programs if it needs to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8070)|
| 2:14:39| We're a step ahead of the rest of the nation in doing some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| And that's what it's going to take to stop some of this stuff, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| And I'd like to ask our chairman, if you would, to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| We've got like three months before budget time to go ahead and set that meeting with the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| and let's get the ball moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| Putting me on the spot here, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| There has been a discussion with Pavlis on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| So I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| I'll continue that discussion and see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| The Knox County Mayor's order reappointing Ruthann Millsaps to the West Knox Utility Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8124)|
| 2:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| And we don't need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| Our agenda is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| I see some of the gentlemen from the billboard in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| Mr. Ammons, Mr. Ammons, we have this as part of our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| And so we're going to recess until 445 when one more honorarium comes up and then we'll take up zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8146)|
| 2:15:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| So we're recessed until 445.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| Commissioners, let's have a seat and we'll resume our honorarium for the Boy Scouts here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8162)|
| 2:16:12| We need to call roll again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8173)|

| 2:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| We have eight present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| We've got a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| As I requested last month, I wanted to, at this particular time, recognize seven Eagle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Scouts of Troop 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| The reason we're doing it right now is because they had commitments earlier in the day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| we wanted to honor their being in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| At this time, Madam Clerk, I would like for you to read a consolidated caption into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8204)|
| 2:17:07| record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| The following resolutions, Resolution 103 through Resolution 109, is honoring Dillon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8228)|

| 2:17:25| Sanders, and Nathaniel G. Weck, and they're being honored for the Boy Scout Troop 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| for earning the rank of Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8251)|

| 2:17:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Go right ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| In the mid-50s, Claps Chapel United Methodist Church accepted a charter from the Boy Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8265)|
| 2:17:52| of America for Troop 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| I learned how to cook, camp, hike, swim, and maybe some other things that we were not supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8276)|
| 2:18:04| to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| But the most important thing is I experienced those exercises, the experience of being in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| the Boy Scouts, and I would say it made me a better person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8294)|
| 2:18:22| It helped me in the Army because I was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| It helped me with AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| It helped me with my continuing education at University of Tennessee, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8307)|
| 2:18:34| I can then lay that cornerstone on being here at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| So if you don't like me at Commission, don't like any Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| Here tonight, there are seven scouts that achieved the rank of Eagle last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| It's a very important year with Boy Scouting in that it was the 100th year of scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| They got a special patch, a special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| It means something to them, and we're here to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| And I would like for the seven scouts to please come down this way and stand here with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8349)|
| 2:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| Spread out around me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| No, don't go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Come over this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Come here, Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| We're going to appear in the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| Thank you, Photo Flash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| What I'm going to do is to hand these, and you're in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| Hand those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| The other thing that I'd like to do at this time is recognize the staff that comes along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| parents and leaders and other scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| Please come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| Please come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| And I'd also like to recognize there's one young scout here tonight who is working on his merit badge for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8405)|
| 2:20:20| citizenship in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| So, see, this is a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| We've got people that are being recognized for being Eagle Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| and we have one young scout here working on his merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| I think that covers what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| I would call on one of the scout leaders to step forward and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8437)|
| 2:20:48| And as we prepare to do this, I have most of the parents standing here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| If you're a parent or accompanying one of these young scouts that is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| or if you are an Eagle Scout in some form or lifetime, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8458)|
| 2:21:11| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| I'm John Weck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| I'm currently the scout master for Troop 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| and our troop has got a great legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| Over 50 years and still on the trail, we've got a huge turnout of parent support with our boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| and that's probably what makes any scouting program successful is when the parents say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| I can't make it every week, but I'll make it when I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| We want to thank you for what you provide for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| The parks and the other resources that we have around the county make it easier for us to show these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| how to have fun outside without having to be plugged into AC power somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| So I want to thank you for your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| and, again, I want to thank all the parents for what they've helped us do with their sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8518)|
