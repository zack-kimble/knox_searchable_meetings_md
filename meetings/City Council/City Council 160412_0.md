| 0:02:42| weather during our great festivals. The University of Tennessee Orange and White game kicks off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=162)|

| 0:03:20| Inn and Copper Cellar. So just tag your social media posts, hashtag Selfie with Smoky, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| then the promotion runs from 11 a.m. Saturday until 9 p.m. that night. See, they did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=207)|

| 0:06:06| Street Fair from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Gay Street and Market Square. This is always a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=366)|

| 0:06:40| It's pretty busy, so plan ahead. Finally, councilmembers already know this. Mayor, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| you leave that, what are they doing about the 700 block that's kind of fenced off? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| they're not. Exclude that from Rossini. It's excluded from Rossini. So it's below that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| or it's the lower block? Well, I presume it's north of that. It's going to be north of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| So finally, councilmembers already know this, but I want to let everybody else know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| the annual State of the City Address and Luncheon will be held this year at noon on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=424)|

| 0:07:41| so we know how many people to plan for. So council, that's the end of my report. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Stair? Thank you, Mayor. I just want to announce that the Public Property Naming Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=467)|

| 0:19:56| amendments you all will be looking at. I need a motion and a second to approve the original motion and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1196)|

| 0:20:48| for the ordinance. So we will start with Daniel Crowder, followed by Patrick Trolley. Eric, can I make a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1248)|
| 0:21:00| comments before we start? Sure. If you will recall when we were here last time, I mean, I think most of us were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| impressed with this proposed ordinance. There were several issues that I'm assuming we're going to hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| tonight, but one was should we allow smokers to be in or near neighborhood areas and would that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| households? There was a question of should we allow waivers of the setback requirements by a handful of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| that live immediately around it and how long would that last? There were questions about should we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| separate tables and chairs and outdoor, sort of building an outdoor restaurant outside the truck or is it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| window service? I mean, those were the primary ones. There were some others in here, too, but that seemed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| the focal point of do we have some things we have to correct before this ordinance goes on and I'm sure we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| people that will help us understand what that is. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Councilman. So Daniel Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| Sir, if you please state your name and address for the record and for our council rules, I'll keep the time. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| up to five minutes. Thank you for being here. Thank you. My name is Daniel Crowder, 2141 Maplewood Drive. I own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| and operate Bulls BBQ food truck and I have been since 2011. I'm also in the process of opening a restaurant on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Sevier Avenue and this is why the proposed smoker ordinance does not make sense to me because, you know, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1344)|
| 0:22:37| food truck permit, the whole purpose of this has been to get food trucks on par with brick and mortar restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1357)|
| 0:22:46| and I don't understand why now, you know, you're proposing to ban smokers on food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| And then let restaurants continue to operate, which, you know, I'll be I'll have a smoker at my restaurant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| So I have trouble seeing the difference there and why, you know, there are plenty of barbecue restaurants, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| downtown that are within residential zones. So I just have trouble seeing the difference between the food truck and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| the brick and mortar restaurant and why we have to have different rules for the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1395)|
| 0:23:24| I guess that's it. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Some things don't take five minutes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you. Okay. Now, Patrick Trelley. Thank you for being here, sir. Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| My name is Patrick Tracy. Oh, I'm sorry. 3106 Topside Road. I'd like to reserve my time to speak after the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| Well, sir, you need to, by the rules, you go ahead and speak now. And then the council may call on you as they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| discussion of different items. Having a setback from residential properties, I don't think that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1431)|
| 0:24:00| Saying that you cannot have a smoker on a food truck is the same as saying, I mean, if this passes, this sets a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1440)|
| 0:24:09| precedence for you and the legal department that we should close every barbecue place or every restaurant that cooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| with wood or smokes food. Because if the whole issue is they smell it, they don't like it. I don't like it when the bread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1455)|
| 0:24:25| company burns bread. It makes the town smell. No matter what kind of food you cook, there's always an odor. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1465)|
| 0:24:34| being within 100 feet of somebody's house, I think that's reasonable to stay back that far. But to be able to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| you've invested your life savings into a business and now going on two years after I did this and was registered with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1480)|

| 0:24:59| unless you close all the restaurants. No more Calhoun's, no more Buddy's, no more Archer's, no more full service. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| pictures of the complaint that I've seen that was sent to the council, that's a brick and mortar business. That is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1505)|
| 0:25:14| food truck. Those people having a smoker sitting next to the street, which there's rules on how close you can set a smoker to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1514)|

| 0:25:29| That's a restaurant, not a food truck. We go to people's places that can't go out to eat and we feed them. So there's a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1529)|
| 0:25:39| difference there. It's not a matter of that we're trying to do anything that a regular restaurant doesn't do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1539)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1548)|

| 0:26:52| Community Forum has communicated its position about this ordinance to City Council since December and we appreciate the changes made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| the ordinance. From the beginning, we have focused our concerns on what impact the proposed ordinance would have on neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| properties and our public parks and rec centers. We urge that in your deliberations tonight to please consider if your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| constituents were living or working right next to a mobile food unit or using a public park, what would be in their best interest so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1633)|

| 0:28:53| smoker, end quote, and number three, clarify the word setback by using the words, quote, the main building setbacks of the base zone. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| oppose, as drafted, Amendments 2B and 3A. If a smoker is used, 100 feet is insufficient distance from residential properties. They also do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| provide any setback from non-residential properties. Both amendments should use the words, quote, the main building setbacks of the base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| zone, end quote. We believe that two additional amendments should be considered and have provided to you the exact language we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| propose. The city should know the location of private properties where MFUs have been given permission to operate. Other cities, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| Nashville, require this information be submitted. Such knowledge is essential to any enforcement strategy and should be on file at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| city and published on their website. It should not be necessary and would be very inefficient for a neighbor who wants to know if an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1777)|
| 0:29:48| MFU has permission to operate to have to call city enforcement officials and ask them to come out and see if the vendor has a letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| permission from the property owner to show the enforcement official. This is Division 3I letter of permission and should be amended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| add the following sentence immediately after the first sentence. Quote, the private property operator shall provide a copy of the letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1802)|
| 0:30:13| permission to the City of Knoxville's Office of Business Support, which shall compile a list of private properties which have granted letters of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| permission to MFU vendors. The ordinance should not allow vendors to set up tables, chairs, etc. on private property for use by the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| public. Allowing tables and chairs changes the fundamental atmosphere of the site and establishes ad hoc restaurants, even in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1827)|
| 0:30:40| districts that do not allow indoor or outdoor restaurants. It encourages the general public to congregate where bathrooms are not required or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| provided and would allow for the consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property. Division 3A additional structures should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| amended in the first sentence to read, when vending on private property, on public property, or right of way outside of a special event. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| we're just adding the words on private property there. The third sentence should remove the words on private property or to read, quote, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| vending within a special event authorized by the Office of Special Events. The last sentence in the current proposed ordinance should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1873)|
| 0:31:23| deleted because if tables and chairs, etc. are not allowed when an MFU is vending to the general public on private property except for special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| events, we do think it's reasonable to delete the last sentence, which would have required the removal of the tables and chairs at the close of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| business every day. So it's a very small change on that. So we thank you for your consideration and we are happy to answer any questions you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| might have. And Mr. Blattner and Ms. Malone will add a few more things since I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| Yeah, I'm sorry. I see on the list now you wanted Mr. Blattner to go before you. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Thank you very much and we'll be happy to answer questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| We have Mr. Wallace on the list, but do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Okay. So we'll go ahead and do all the neighbors first on this. So Mr. Blattner, you're next then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| I'm Jim Blattner, 3819 Glenfield Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| I'd like to say I believe, Councilman Wallace, that the definitions for smokers was well-defined and answered your question that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| two weeks ago. I again commend the ladies for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1954)|
| 0:32:46| For food trucks, again, I'm against smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| I gave you the reasons last week and I won't elaborate on those very much except for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| And that's one of the problems that I have with mobile smokers, and that's that they move from site to site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| So they're here today, gone tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| If it was me, I would be there for lunch at the best location I could find and I would continue in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| probably go to the old city or some place where people congregate and I could do some business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| To smoke, it takes 12 to 14 hours if you're going to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| That means that you're going to smoke it from early in the morning until you're done at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| And that means that when you move that smoker, you're going to be a hazard for traffic and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| I would like to tell you that most of the barbecue places in town that have multiple locations smoke it in one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2021)|
| 0:33:53| and move it to the other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| Archers will smoke at 10 to 12. They have five locations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| New one down on Gay Street, a little development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| They keep it on site, but they hold it and reheat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| They don't actually reheat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| They kept it held at temperature, and then you're served a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| That is an alternative for these people, such as the gentleman that talks about opening up on Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| He could have a smoker on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| I would imagine that he'll work out a way to cook it and smoke it on Sevier and move it to the location wherever he's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2074)|
| 0:34:48| Again, no smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| This ordinance does not regulate smokers on a location such as a permanent location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| It just doesn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| It's only for the mobile food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And I think that the people who are currently smoking on site, and I believe that's a very few number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| I believe they can find another way to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| And I just don't think that the rest of us should be put at risk because of some individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| I'll be glad to talk with anybody if they'd like to talk with them about holding equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| I have a fair amount of experience in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And, again, we've all had buddies barbecue, but when have you seen a smoker on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| I'll be glad to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| That will come later, sir, perhaps not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Okay. Now, Ms. Malone, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Thank you. Always a pleasure. Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| And I'm speaking on Amendment 4 that was provided by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| We have no changes to the definition of smoker as proposed by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| We do have one condition that we'd like to add to the definition of external preparation unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| We add the condition that only gas or electricity be used, in other words, not charcoal or wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| That is consistent with the existing requirements of the fire department regarding events on city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| We also identified in Division 3Q, Preparation Outside the MFU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| a section that must be amended in order to maintain consistency within the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| if smokers are not allowed to operate on private property in conjunction with the MFU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| except for the special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| And we have included that language for Division 3Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2235)|
| 0:37:24| And basically what it says is it continues and repeats the language that has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2244)|
| 0:37:33| by the law department having to do with safety cones, fencing, and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| for the external grilling units, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| as well as the fencing for a smoker, a barrel smoker that would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| as part of a special event festival, which we do not object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| A lot has been said about the investment on the part of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2278)|
| 0:38:09| that get into the MFU business, and we are sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| We understand it's a large investment. It's been described as one's life savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Well, so is somebody's house, and so is somebody's commercial business in a brick-and-mortar store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| On the one hand, the argument is why can't we be treated like brick-and-mortar places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| But on the other hand, we want to be in zoning districts that have never allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| or do not allow brick-and-mortar restaurants or outdoor restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| You can't have it both ways, boys and girls, unless you just want it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| and the heck with the rest of the world. In other words, how do you stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| we want to be treated like other restaurants, but we want to be in office zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| and we want to be in C1 zones where use on review is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| We don't want to have to have scrubbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| We all know that breathing wood smoke is an unpleasant thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| and it's unpleasant to have it in your house where people have invested their life savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| and are trying to raise their family. So I think reality check is a good thing once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| We ask that you remove smokers. We ask that you seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| the requests that have been provided to you on these options by the community forum. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you, ma'am. And now Ms. Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| Take your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| My name is Patricia Barrier. I'm at 807 Phillips Avenue in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| I'm just off of Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Actually, I want to thank all the council members that replied to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| And even if you didn't, I started calling to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| I actually live in what is a foreign-based code. It is SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| We have lived in our house for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| It's always been zoned residential until the foreign-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| What I wanted to do, I did my printers, running out of ink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| but I printed off this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And Councilman Wallace, you actually noted that SW1 is just not in our area, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| We're just off of Scottish Pike, which is a very large area on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| We're this small section right off of Sevier Avenue in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And what abuts next to us or borders us is what's called SW3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| And as a resident in a residential house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| I am opposed to smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| I've not seen the amendments, so I don't know what was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| I actually got online and could not find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| But I did want to say that in the SW1 plan, which is online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| the uses for SW1 is household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| On a use on review, it's allowed worship, schools, and daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| The signage is a house number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And on the very front on the regulating plan, it states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| large-scale assemblage of residential properties or any commercial uses are prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Suggested building types include detached houses, cottages, duplex houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| I would like to see SW1 included along with the residential with regards to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| I can also pull out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| Waivers, those are almost impossible to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| For someone to get a waiver, especially in our area, you're looking at SW3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| Literally, there's an alley between SW1 and SW3, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| So someone could actually park in the back of SW3 and they would be right against SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| This is not an issue with Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| And then I don't want to waste your time reading the e-mail that I sent out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| I did also print off a larger map showing SW1 with SW3, which is on the north side of Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2575)|
| 0:43:12| I'm not including SW2, even though that's high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| I'm interested in just our residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2598)|
| 0:43:32| As far as I know, there are no restrictions that I'm aware of that Council cannot act, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| to include these four blocks of Phillips Avenue, SW1, in the MFU ordinance for the 100-foot block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2619)|
| 0:43:48| And as I said, I've not seen the amendments, so I don't know if you still have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| I agree that a 100-foot restriction would really be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2633)|
| 0:44:04| Because I have to admit that even people, they have a little pit out back, and on occasion, they will have a fire and sit out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| That's on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| But when it comes to smokers that do not have vents or scrubbers, that's a real nuisance when it comes to a residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2655)|
| 0:44:25| Basically, if there's any questions, I would be glad to try and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2682)|

| 0:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Won't be able to learn or experience what they can do with a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Y'all going to put a lot of people out of business just because of three individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| that don't like smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| People build up their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| They save their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| They do things that create revenue in the city, or y'all going to truly make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| that hurts someone's business for every sweat and tear that they put into their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| Are y'all really going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Because if you are, open up the unemployment office because it's going to be full of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| that voted for you, and y'all going to do something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| It's only one person that I took notice of the last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| This gentleman right here, and he truly believed in small business to where that gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| right there did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| It's kind of contradicting, but I agree with you on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| You should create a listing smoking bill because it don't take no 16 hours, and it don't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| no 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| That's what they want you to tell you, but it don't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| I'd do anything I want to do in less than seven and a half hours, and it's good, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| fresh, and it's off the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| So then therefore, with the people that don't like smoke, close your doors, lock your windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| you'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| I guess everybody going to stand up in the park when they have family reunions and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| be allowed to sit at a family reunion, or a picnic, or a birthday party, or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| We created the park so people could have a good time and enjoy recreational activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2851)|
| 0:47:39| but then they're not allowed to grill in the park, that the city has put the grill there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| and the taxpayers have a right to do what they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| When it comes to alcohol, are you supposed to have food when you're on the club in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| to sell alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| I think your numbers are supposed to match, outweigh your liquor costs on your food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| I've been doing this ever since 1975 at Regas Restaurant, and spreading my love throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| this place I call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Because opening up 19 restaurants in Knoxville, working for a couple of selling cathomes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| 28 years, and experience different venues, different ways to create food, and make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| better than some of the restaurants, I ain't going to say better, I'm saying off the chain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| because that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| When I get a hold of a pot and a pan, or some saute items, or even the smoker that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| I purchase, it's because I put my sweat and tears into what I learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| I had to do on-hand experience, waking up 5.30 in the morning as a 7-year-old boy going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| out and getting hen eggs out of hen baskets, or picking corn, or greens, or green beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| It's experience, and that's what my granny installed in me, and that's what I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Because my love for food is better than the love for most people, but all at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| time I love people, but I love food even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| And I appreciate your time, and your effort, I hope y'all make the right decision, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| we all fight for our business, just like they fight for their homes, and I appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| very much, but I'm still going to smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| It still take wood, it still take charcoal, it still take lighter fluid, and I'm still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| going to do what I got to do in order to support myself without unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Okay, council, that's the end of those who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| Yeah, I don't know if Joe Walsh is here, or if Patricia or someone else is going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| on this, but as I read these proposed regulations, the park department gets to set its own rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3009)|
| 0:50:20| about what happens in Knoxville parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Am I misreading that, or what is the approach being taken here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| It seems to me that they can have a wholly different standard than you have for mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| trucks going on public roadways or on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Would you tell me how that's supposed to work with the parks department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| So, within the city of Knoxville, we have property that's zoned OS, open space, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| I think we have two sub-districts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Most of that property is parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Some of it is privately owned, it's country clubs, golf courses, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| But by and large, those are parks that are owned by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And because we have so much variation within our parks, as far as size, how they're situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| what they're used for, we wanted to give parks and rec flexibility in creating rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| regulations for those parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| So we sat down with Joe and some of his staff members and talked about which parks they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| would allow food trucks to operate within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And then within those parks, specifically where within the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| So there is online, there are the maps that show specifically where within the designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| parks a food truck can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| And then the parks obviously wanted to add additional sort of parameters because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| unique way that the parks operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| They have events, they have soccer clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Some of them have concession stands, some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| The parks operate from dusk to dawn, whereas a country club that's zoned OS might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| a food truck there after dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| So we wanted to give the park flexibility in those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| And where those rules wouldn't speak to some mode of operation, the underlying regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3130)|
| 0:52:19| for food trucks would take that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| So there's no no ways permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| You can't have the LED lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| It doesn't say that necessarily in the park regulations, but those apply to all food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| So basically the parks and rec rules add more restrictive regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| They can't be less restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| They're at least your basic rules plus whatever they need to protect the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I don't have them right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| So I don't want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| You set the baseline and they can be more strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Not more lenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Gerald Green, would you tell us briefly, I mean, we've had this discussion about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| do brick and mortar restaurants do versus food trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| And someone made the point, I don't know who it was, that brick and mortar restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| are set to be in specific zones and they have certain rules that sort of govern commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| activity and now we're talking about mobile trucks that can go in or near neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| and bring influences that are different than might be permitted in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| So tell us what about brick and mortar restaurants, where they're generally allowed under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Well, brick and mortar restaurants are permitted in the commercial districts and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| that's the major difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| And in our form code districts, that's the major difference in the zoning ordinance treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| of the brick and mortar restaurants and the proposed mobile food unit ordinance in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| the mobile food units would be permitted in some of the office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| However, the proximity to residential uses and districts with office districts and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3247)|
| 0:54:15| districts, typically there's no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| They often and typically do back up to residential uses and districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Well, I have seen situations where MPC uses an office zone as a transition from, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| a general commercial area to a residential so they have a less intense activity in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| office space and then they taper it down to a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| And ideally, we would love to do that everywhere, but I think a road, I'm sure you and I both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| travel daily Broadway where there's a, and there are many corridors like there where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| there's a commercial strip along the corridor and then they back up directly onto residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| So we certainly have a lot of grandfathered activity that goes on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| And I heard a comment from the back and there is maybe one, the biggest difference possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| between the brick and mortar restaurant and the mobile food unit is that the smoker or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| the stove or the range or the oven, whatever in that brick and mortar restaurant would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| often be inside, whereas with the mobile food unit, it's more open to the atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| and to the neighboring uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Do they have hooded requirements and that kind of thing inside the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| In other words, do they have some corrective device before it exits the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| It's been a long time since I worked in the BAHU restaurant, but I believe they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| They had good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| But under the building code, the cooking appliances in a brick and mortar restaurant would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3352)|
| 0:56:01| required to have some type of exhaust hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Councilman...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| I mean, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I think that we have a number of issues that we really want to talk about this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| in terms of what the ordinance is and it seems to me that a couple of them that we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| the will of council in terms of situations such as the smokers, whether we proceed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| terms of distance requirements and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| And so I'd like to go ahead and propose the amendment that was given to us by Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| This is on page 3 of 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| An MFU shall not be permitted to use a smoker as part of its mobile vending operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| Nothing herein shall prohibit a vendor from using a smoker in a location that is separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| from its vending location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| This is a modification to 2ADI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| So I'd like to make that motion that we go ahead and see what the will of council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| in terms of whether we have smokers or not have smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| So the motion is to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| What's the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Bans smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| The motion is to bans...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| It's in what Krista had prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| It's on page 3 of 3 under amendment B, option 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3439)|
| 0:57:28| An MFU shall not be permitted to use a smoker as part of its mobile vending operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Nothing herein shall prohibit a vendor from using a smoker in a location that is separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| from its vending location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| So that is the first amendment to basically ban the smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| I'll second that, but I'm wondering if council would also add the definition of smoker to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| It's in number 4 there that Krista prepared so we know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| She was going to expand the definitions that are on the first page of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| so you know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Would you include that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| That's also on page 3 of 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| The definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3500)|
| 0:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| So tell me what the motion is, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I think the motion is to amend to eliminate smokers and to define smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| And that's it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| So we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I see Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| I just wanted to ask a question about how many, I guess, Krista, I asked you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| we may have had this already in deliberations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| how many smokers do we have now that are active in food trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| No, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| I know, but I got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I think we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I know, I got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| No, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| It's a rotisserie or a smoker, okay, that they use on the inside of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| The only way you are using a renovation...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Mr. Wallace, you're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| I asked Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Mr. Wallace, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I think we have three trucks that are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| and several other trucks using smokers that are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Four, sorry, four trucks that are permitted that use smokers of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Well, I'm not going to support the banning of smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| I think that we can put some reasonable expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| and setbacks on that as called for throughout this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| So I guess we're speaking to Councilman Grief's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| and I don't support banning it altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| I would support Councilman Wallace on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| You know, we've had this pilot program for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| and the purpose of the pilot program is to try it out, see what's working, see what doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| And I think, you know, originally our law department did a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| and, you know, smokers weren't an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| but somehow over the last few weeks it's become this huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| And, you know, we've got a number of businesses using these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| and I mean, I guess it could be a potential nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| but I certainly haven't heard about it being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I don't think the administration has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| So we've heard from a number of business owners that have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| and we're going to change their whole business model tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I just don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| So I would make a substitute motion for 3A to limit it to 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3669)|
| 1:01:19| and couple that with Amendment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| So the substitute motion is 3A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| which is to amend the 100-foot distance restriction to apply only to MFUs using smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And to also include the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| And also include the definition of Amendment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| Definition of smoker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| All the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Yes, all the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| So the substitute motion, we had a motion and a second to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| is to amend the 100-foot distance restriction to apply only to MFUs using smokers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and to also include the definitions in Amendment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I'd like to ask Mr. Wallace a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| Yes, Mr. Wallace, you've been asked a question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Is your operation, you're in the Old City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Yes, on Friday and Saturday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| On two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Are you opposed to any kind of restriction in terms of how many feet with your smoker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3750)|
| 1:02:40| Are you not wanting any restriction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| I don't think that you should oppose it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| because unless you can stop these companies from making them and selling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| then how are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Y'all are going to hurt a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Y'all really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| When you work in a restaurant, they've got rotisserie smokers in the back made into the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| When you get ready to sell, it's straight off the grill underneath a ventilation hood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| that is required by our fire extinguisher line to help put out grease fires in case it gets too hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| Even the wooden grill that Regas used to own in Calhoun also has a wooden grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| It's a lot of places on the inside that has a wooden grill, but you have to have a ventilation hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| The ventilation hood draws up the smoke of the grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| Fire items or anything, flat grill or griddle or anything else of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| it all depends on how y'all are going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| Y'all are going to hurt a lot of people, and it's unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| because people don't like certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| What you going to do about the Zik virus of mosquitoes this summer that covers half of the United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| They are not prejudiced. You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| And they ain't with it. If it stings you, it's going to sting me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| So you might as well give yourself up, because we're all going to get stung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| So then, hey, I don't know what you're going to do, but please make a general good decision this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| because the last nine times I've been up here, it's just been putting it off, putting it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| I've been waiting and waiting and waiting and patting my feet to see if I'm going to move my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| or just move out of the state of Tennessee, a place that I grew up in and not so all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| And then we got people going to make rational decisions to close a whole lot of business all because of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| What you do about cigarettes and tobacco and the fake smoke that people are smoking nowadays out of these little pipes and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3880)|
| 1:04:50| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Krista, I'm going to go back to Ms. Barrier's request about SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| And what do you think about that and addressing that issue in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| Or how have you addressed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Well, I know that you and I had talked about this yesterday over e-mail and following our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| I talked more with Peter and Deanne Bogus, our new form code administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| And after talking with them, I think we are of the opinion that South Waterfront 1 is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| And so we would need to make a tweak to the language on the zoning districts to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| But after looking at the form code further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| we determined that it would be a residentially zoned property for the purposes of the Mobile Food Unit Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Is that page 6, double I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Actually, if you flip back to page 5, the Commercial, Industrial, and Form Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| And then sort of going over into page 6, it specifies SW, which is South Waterfront form code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| So that would need to be changed to South Waterfront 2 through 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| And then in Romanet, two residential districts to add South Waterfront 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| So I asked Councilman Starr if you would allow that, if you would amend your motion to include what Ms. Carrico just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3981)|
| 1:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| I was thinking just to take the smoker issue on its own and then potentially make that amendment afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| We can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Anyway, I'd like to, I think after our conversation and what's been brought up, I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| And so I want to add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Now, if you want to come back and add it later, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| So I don't want to get it left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| So how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| We'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| So we kind of have a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| So we'll kind of approve this first one on a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| All these motions are just to amend the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Let me get to Vice Mayor Grieve on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| We're still on this motion, the substitute motion related to the 100-foot distance requirement in residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| Part of the reason I made the motion is that because of the Sunshine Law, as all of us know, we can't discuss it among each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| So really part of the reason for throwing that out in the beginning was to see what the will of the council was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| So frankly, I'd like to withdraw my motion with all these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Your motion to ban the smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| So this becomes, can he do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I was trying to make it simple, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| I would recommend just voting for my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Why don't you just wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| It would make it a lot simpler if you just leave it there and let us handle the substitute motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Let us vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Please vote for my motion and get a couple others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| So we'll hold that there and just work on the substitute motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| So we're on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| I was going to ask Councilman Starr, would you repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| How about we let, do we want Krista to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Or do you want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I mean, it's essentially 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| 3A and 3B were dealing with the smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| 3B was to ban them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| 3A was to permit them but subject them to a 100-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| For residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| And so I thought 3A made a nice compromise, and that's why I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| I wish I could say I drafted it all up, but our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| That's why we have lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Ms. Cougarow did that, did an excellent job giving us these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Councilman, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Then you added, if I recall, the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| I must say I don't have a lot of problem with that, but I'm curious about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4148)|
| 1:09:18| 225 to 275, how do you enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| It says typically between those temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| So I think that's just sort of a reference point, but that would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| We're not going to go out with the infrared thermometers and measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| Why do you need that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Why do you need the temperature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I think that's just generally how smokers operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| The typical temperature, I think it's helpful for interpretation of an operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| If we're talking about a much higher temperature, then it's probably not smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| That's what I learned doing my research on these types of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| What if Mr. Wallace cooks it a little hotter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Well, we'll just have to investigate that and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| So the substitute motion is for Amendment 3A, which allows the smokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| 100-foot distance restriction from residentially zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| and it also includes Amendment 4 on the paper here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| which are the definitions of smoker and external preparation unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Are we all in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Is that correct, Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Did you want to speak to that, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I want to speak to that, and I don't know the proper procedural approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| but I want to change 100 feet to 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| His provision, but with a 200-foot distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| You can't amend the substitute motion, so you have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| So we have to do it separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| You have to do that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| Then you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| So we ready to vote on the 100-foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I think last time when we discussed this, we also had some input from the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Is there someone there that might want to speak to this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| We've heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I think we've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| We've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Can they speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Can they speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| We've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| We know if you amend the rules, you can do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| Well, but we also heard that there was a possibility of a compromise that they were agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| and I'd just like to give them a chance if they want to voice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| You're free to call on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| That's what we typically do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| What they've agreed to is, I think, what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| So I'd just like to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Why don't you just ask them that question then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Ms. Malone, would you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| The compromise that you had folks worked out with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| You know, two weeks ago was a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| I think what you told me that you had agreed with the 100-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| There were other conditions as well associated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| and there have since been other issues raised, such as the need for setbacks between a business and a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| And also, you know, also questions raised about seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| There are no setbacks to the seating, so the seating can be on the property lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| Well, let me interrupt you just a minute if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| What we're really talking about is the 100-foot distance that this amendment is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| and that was discussed last time at that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Those other issues are still on the table in terms of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| And I think the position, and it was not the position of the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| The position was if we can't get rid of smokers, and there were three parts, as I recall, to an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4384)|
| 1:13:14| and I can't remember exactly what each of those parts were, but there were three parts to an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| and that was not the position of the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Okay, so are we ready to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| If you support smokers with the 100-foot distance rule for residential property, then you will vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4411)|
| 1:13:44| And the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| If you don't support smokers or the 100-foot distance, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| So let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Councilman Kampen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Councilman Pavlis is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Passes 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Substitute motion passes 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| Now I'd like to amend the thing we just adopted to change 100 feet to 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Same provision that we just voted on, but the distance from residential property would be 200 feet from the structure, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4471)|
| 1:14:40| or the base setback, whatever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| We'll speak to it, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| What's the rationalization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| I think that gives you more room for dissipation and maybe pollution dilution is no solution back from the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| But if you're living in the house and you're in the direct line of the plume and it's 100 foot away or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| I think the impact is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| And I can't imagine that the food truck can't find a place to position itself so he's 200 feet away from houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| where, you know, someone, especially someone who's either very young or very old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| and may be susceptible to fine particulate pollution in their lungs and, you know, whether they have asthma or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| but those are the people that in medicine are usually the target groups for impact of fine particulate matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| So 200 feet gives you a little more chance for it to fall out of the sky, to dissipate in the wind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| and there's a lot of places you can have a smoker and still be 200 foot from a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| I just think that's prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| We can always make it shorter, but I hate to see us start with whacking people over the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| when we can try it this way and see if we need to have an amendment after some period of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| So I think it's a safer alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| I'd like to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I'll ask Daniel Crowder or Patrick Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Y'all give us your opinion on whether that gives you how much heartburn that gives you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| Is there a difference to you all, 100 to 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| On the footage, Patrick Tracy, if you really are truly smoking food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| it does not look like a steam plant with smoke coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| Smoke coming out of a smoker when you're cooking food properly is lazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| The places you set up and use, is a 200 foot distance requirement going to impede your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4600)|
| 1:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| At some of the wedding venues, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| When we go to particular venues where they hire us to come and serve weddings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| there are most of the wedding venues back up to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| So, Krista, right now it's 100 feet from where the smoker is to the property line of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4628)|
| 1:17:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| So from where your smoker is to the property line is less than 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| That's what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| So where you set your smoker up to the property line of a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| My smoker is enclosed in my trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| In my food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| So from where that trailer is to the nearest property line of a residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| is it less or greater than 200 feet in most cases where you operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| It's more than 100, but it's not always less than 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| We're here 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| So the motion is to amend from 100 to 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Are you all ready to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| I mean, Mr. Crowder, how do you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Councilman Wallace has recognized you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Daniel Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| I know it would affect me at Beard and Beer Market and at Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| Those are two places that I've been that that distance would affect my business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Do you use your smoker there at Beard and Beer Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| And as Patrick was saying, you know, I've seen more smoke come out of a fast food restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4712)|
| 1:18:42| that comes out of my smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| And that's, you know, that's the problem I have with it is I have trouble seeing the difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| And a 200-foot rule would drastically affect my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| And I guess that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| I mean, here we've made, you're trying to accommodate, as Councilman Starr said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| trying to accommodate these existing businesses without trying to put them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| And I think 200 feet is just an arbitrary number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| And they recommended 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| It's been in the pilot at 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And I support where we are and support 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Vice Mayor Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| I'd like to call on Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| I thought he was going to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| I appreciate trying to accommodate businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| I think you should also try to accommodate people who are living in their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| I think Councilman Della Vopi is absolutely correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| and I really suggest everyone go talk to a pulmonologist if you can get one on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| 100 feet is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| And keep in mind, if you're doing a wedding on a residential lot, on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4790)|
| 1:19:59| and you're invited in and not vending to the public, you don't come under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| This is the roving trucks going down the public way, Bearden Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I don't know what the distance is at Bearden Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| I don't know how close the nearest residential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| If you want, figure out how close that is and make it 172 or 73 or whatever fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| But for heaven's sakes, 100 feet is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| And everyone can say, oh, you know, I can smoke without smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Maybe you want to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| But again, a reality check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| I guess the, I'm sorry, the gentleman in the green shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| Is the 100 foot, can you operate with that distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| It would be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| It would be much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Mr. Crowder, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Yeah, I think we should stick with the 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| So I'll be voting against the motion to extend it to 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| I'm going to call on Krista again because something was just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| Maybe it didn't sink into all my colleagues' minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| But if you have a private invitation to go onto a premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| and serve that premise as opposed to people on the public right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| the distance question doesn't come up at all, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| It's only when you're vending on the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| Tell us how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| So we're talking about the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| If you are in a zone that is not residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| how far you have to be from residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| That's what we're talking about with this distance restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| We have private individuals in residential zone districts who are essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| catering private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| And the food trucks are coming onto their lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| and operating essentially a catering business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| That's been happening far before we had the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| It's been happening during the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| At that point it's not a food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| It's not really operating like a food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| They would probably still need to be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| but the distance restriction doesn't apply to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| because that's not how it's drafted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| We're talking about trucks operating in zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| other than residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| and how far they have to be from that residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| But if they're on the premises by invitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| then they're really just catering or serving that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| In residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| In residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Well, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| And to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| I mean we have people that have been smoking meat in backyards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| for I don't know how long around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| We're not regulating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Well, that's exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| but how many people are calling and getting sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| about smoke bailing from people smoking meat on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| when it's been going on for I don't know how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| a meat smoker's been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| I mean I understand we're not regulating private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| but to that point it's been going on a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and we don't have a lot of complaints coming from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| That's just part of what I wanted to comment about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| In the pilot program, was there a distance requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| Special zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| I don't think that there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| I've looked at a lot of drafts of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| so there was not a distance restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| and there wasn't any specific regulation on smokers in the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| You were in special zones, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Patricia Robledo, is there any complaints during the pilot program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5033)|
| 1:24:03| Patricia Robledo, Office of Business Support, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| No complaints at all about smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| I checked with 311 with Russ Jensen, the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| No complaints to 311 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| I think that's an important note for all of us to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| We've had this pilot program for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| We've heard from a number of operators who are out there operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| We've had zero complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| We've heard some concerns from residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| We've instituted a 100-foot setback after we listened to those complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| and I think that's a fair compromise, and hopefully we can live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So I think without objection we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| So we have a motion to amend from 100 to 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| So if you support the 100 feet, you'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| If you support the 200 feet, you'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| The motion fails 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| So it stays at 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| So now I want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Yeah, you want to go to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Yeah, I want to go back to the SW-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| And have Mr. Grieve explain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| or just state what we're looking for on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| to add it in to be included in the residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| So on page 5 of the Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| it would need to be amended page 5 onto page 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| where it says SW on the first line of page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| That would need to be changed to SW-2 through 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| Commercial, industrial, and form code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| That's the subsection we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| And the first line on page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| So instead of SW there, we'll have SW-2 through 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| And in remnant 2, further down, middle of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| We'll add SW-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| That's the motion I make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Did we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Okay, is there anything else in terms of amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| I don't think we've addressed Amendment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Another amendment that would need to be made is currently the distance restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| for all mobile food units is still at 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| And so I would suspect that council would want to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| based on the discussion last time and its discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| So we're talking about MFUs without smokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| if there's going to be a different setback for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| At the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| there was discussion about having it comply with the base zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| You're talking about the waiver provision, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| That's one amendment that will need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| and then the second amendment relating to the setbacks for MFUs without smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| In Amendment 3A, it did state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| in allowed non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| any MFU without a smoker shall operate in a location according to the setbacks of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5275)|
| 1:28:04| At the top of page 3, the highlighted portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| So that was incorporated in the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| Are we saying you don't need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Do we need Amendment 2A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| To be safe, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| I would move to adopt Amendment 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Which allows MFUs without smokers on non-residential parcels to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| and locate according to the setbacks of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5325)|
| 1:28:54| Okay, so we're on Amendment 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Yeah, let's go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| So let's define that a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| So what is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Where does the truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| The truck has to be set back from the residential property to the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| Explain that a little bit more in greater detail on how that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| So each zoning district specifies for the parcels within that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| where a structure has to be situated on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| And that within even one parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| it varies based on whether we're talking about the front setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| the rear yard setback, or the side yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| And so presumably if we're talking about the setbacks for the base zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| if the MFU is in the side yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| it would have to comply with the side yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| If it's in the front yard, front yard setbacks and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| And again, those vary by zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| That's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| So you're setting up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| we'll go back to the casual pint that was here last time and beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5403)|
| 1:30:11| They've been operating on zero distance requirements setback at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| I don't know that for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| I mean, you're throwing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| I'm not sure we fully understand what that setback is going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| how that's going to impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| I think that's just too restrictive based on where we were last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5428)|
| 1:30:37| They said they parked right outside the door, on the side door of the casual pint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| That's where they parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| So that being the case, where does he have to set back from if the setback is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| It all depends on what the zone of where the casual pint's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Your front yard setback is whatever, 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| I think it's probably C3 if I had to make an educated guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| So 15 is the rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| So Gerald is informing me that 15 is the rear yard setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| so they would have to be 15 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Front yard setback is 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| So that's one big parcel that encompasses that strip mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| I don't think side yards would really be an issue for them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| So he has to be 25 feet from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| He had to be 25 feet from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| and no closer than 15 feet from the rear property setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| So where are they set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| I don't know where they set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| I think they set up in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| I think that's what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Talking about the beer market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| The beer market, he sets up right there in the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| or right there near the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| I think my alternative motion on that is that there be no setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| So I'll offer a substitute motion there be no setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| That's what we were getting to last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| We restricted the smoker to 100 feet, and that was kind of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| Casual Pint said, look, I don't have a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| or I don't use a food truck with a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| but the setback becomes restrictive to his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| I guess I sort of only looked at what was on the menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| You're getting hungry already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| I think I would agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I guess in my mind I was remembering the Casual Pint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| They said they only needed 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| but I guess that was maybe from the residential line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Well, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| If we don't do away with the potential of a waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| anybody that wants to go get permission from the residents that are affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| won't that impact that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| I don't think the waivers are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| You have to add that by motion, if I understand it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| I'm not adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| I would second your amendment to my motion or your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5598)|
| 1:33:27| Let's make sure Krista is following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| You're going to second my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| I don't know where I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Okay, so the way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| we have a substitute motion to say that there be no restrictions when you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| what's the caveats here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| When there's not a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| No distance restrictions when there's no smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| No setbacks, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| Setbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Are you following this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Okay, so substitute where there's no setbacks if there's no smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| So it would read in the allowed nonresidential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| any MFU without a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| and then I think for recommended language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| does not have to adhere to any setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| I mean, that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| So if it's adjacent to a residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Ask Krista, don't ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| But are we saying, Krista,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| are we saying that a food truck can be parked right next to a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Without a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Without a setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| No setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Nonresidential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Without a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Why would we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Okay, so that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| Could you repeat the motion so that we're all really clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Well, I see a lot of puzzled faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| Krista, could you repeat the motion, the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| As you understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| And it may be helpful to look at Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| So we're looking at page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5731)|
| 1:35:40| D, Roman at I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| And we're looking at the second sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| which starts at the very end of the fourth line with the word in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| Everybody on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Page 528.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| So in lieu of the sentence that currently exists in that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| we would be putting in a sentence that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| in the allowed nonresidential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| any MFU without a smoker does not have to adhere to setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5764)|
| 1:36:12| And then we would have a sentence per our previous motion that would follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| that says any MFU using a smoker shall operate 100 feet from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| So you can kiss up to a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5789)|
| 1:36:41| People mull this for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| So what we're basically saying is that the truck can be right next to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| residential, whether it has a generator or doesn't have a generator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| or whatever on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| So we're not taking into consideration the residential folks that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5817)|
| 1:37:09| Because if you have a setback for a truck with a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| then why not have the setback for the truck without a smoker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| I assume you're addressing that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| Well, I was looking at you, but not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| You'd be glad for anybody to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Well, to go back to where we were two weeks ago with Casual Pint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| and I don't want to put words in their mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| but they said that they invited these food trucks onto their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| at certain times, and they did not allow smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| And right now there's no distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| And the pilot, Chris, this is right, there's no distance requirement for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| So the food truck comes onto their property at their request without a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| and he said that because of the condo association behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| it violated the 100-foot setback, and he would be out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| He's in a commercial, we were guessing C3 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| and he uses it on the back of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| So, I mean, that's kind of where I think it, Beard and Beer Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| I'm not technically sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Now, where residential property is there, I guess, is across Linesview Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| In that case, it's pretty far up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| But it's from the, it's from where, if she's explained it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| if I understand it right, it's from where the smoker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| or smoker truck sits to the residential property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| In his case, it's probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Now, when you get to Sevier Avenue, it's going to change again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| because you've got residential property across Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| So that's probably, you know, you get into the 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| This is what you're going to run into when you start getting into mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| You're going to run into some of these kind of, this little bit of conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| But it's still without the smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| So, I mean, they can't have the smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| And, you know, I mean, we haven't talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| but, I mean, if that's an issue with the generator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| then, you know, throw in a substitute motion or amend it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| if you want to add shore power in those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| I mean, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Yeah, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| It sounds like we're going from a set of restrictions with smokers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| that are at the minimum 100 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| and now we're going to people in residences have no rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| The bulk of the people in this community are taxpayers that own their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| and you're going to say that a handful of businesses can just intrude on their privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| their quiet, without any setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| I think Krista told us the setback in the rear was 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| If they can't live with that, move the damn truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Why are we shortchanging residential property owners who are the core of this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Trucks are king, I guess, in your world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| Okay, so is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| Okay, so we're going to vote on the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| that there are no setback restrictions if there are no smokers, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| Is that correct, Krista, shorthand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| Okay, we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Say it once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Okay, this is a substitute motion where there would be no setback restrictions requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| if you do not have a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| Do you support that, no setbacks without a smoker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Then you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| And no with your post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| Fifteen feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| The motion fails because it's a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| I want to see if you're on or want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Our policy is not to vote on these things, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| So we're back to 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| No, we're back to 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| What is the normal setback that exists in the zoning code for structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| Back to the original motion, which is amendment 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| Would you explain that, Krista, amendment 2A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| So what it provides is that any MFU operating without a smoker will adhere to the setbacks of the base zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| which operate in the manner that I described earlier and vary by zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6115)|
| 1:42:04| That would be 15 feet in the rear and 25 feet in the front in a C3 zone, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Would you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Fifteen feet in the rear and 25 feet in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| It's like the casual pine, 25 feet from the street and 15 feet if they park in the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6140)|
| 1:42:30| Could we recognize Ms. Malone to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| Ms. Malone, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Just very briefly, I would ask, and I know Ms. Cuccaro and Director Green is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| I would ask that we just be very specific so that the setbacks that have been quoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| have been for the main building as opposed to an accessory building or as opposed to a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6167)|
| 1:42:55| There are all kinds of setbacks in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| So I would just ask that we be very clear that it be the setback of the main building, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6177)|
| 1:43:07| which I think is what has been meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| Right, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| And that's a term of art in the zoning code, you're saying, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| I'm saying the main building setback is defined, but there are other setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6195)|
| 1:43:23| so I think we need to be very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| That is the one we've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Why don't we ask Mr. Green for some of the setbacks in C3 zones for main buildings versus accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you, Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| The great thing about the C3 zone is it does not distinguish between principal buildings and accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| It states that all buildings shall adhere to the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| In the front, it's 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| The rear, the side is 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| The rear, for a single building not serviced from the rear, abutting a residential district, is 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| If there's service from the rear, the rear setback is 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| I'm sorry, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Is the rear setback 30 feet or 15 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| If the building is serviced from the rear, let's say there's a loading dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| or some type of courtyard in the back where services are provided, the setback is 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| If there's no rear service area, the setback is 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| No less than 15 feet from residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| Okay, so we're at Amendment 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| We have a motion and a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Are you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| Repeat the motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| Motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| This is changing the second sentence of the section we talked about earlier to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| in the allowed non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| any MFU without a smoker shall operate in a location according to the setbacks of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6312)|
| 1:45:23| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| We'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Okay, that passes 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| All right, what's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Yes, I would like to make a motion that we adopt the alternate provision drafted by CRISTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| that removes the waiver by folks within, whatever the heck that was, 400 feet or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| It just seems to me that it was pointed out to us last time that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| one, a handful of people, and two, if they move or leave, is it still good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| And what if the new person doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| I mean, it seems to me that the waiver just adds a complication we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| And makes it harder to enforce, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Is this Amendment 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| This is Amendment 1 on the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Amendment 1, yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Okay, we had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| Does everyone understand that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| You all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Councilman Del Vothe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Yes, I would like to add at the very end, or maybe before the indemnity section at the very end on page 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| some language that accomplishes this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| The city reserves the right to change or add to these regulations and all MFUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| after 14 days notice, shall comply with the revised requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| In other words, I don't want to see that we give a permit for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| we find out we have a problem and someone claims he's grandfathered for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| They take their permit subject to evolving regulations as long as they have fair notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| I can read that slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| The city reserves the right to change or add to these regulations and all MFUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| after 14 days notice, shall comply with the revised requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6473)|
| 1:48:01| Your lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| You always have the right to change your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Does it affect the existing permit or have they got a year's buy on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6488)|
| 1:48:17| It's just sort of a reservation, just so everyone knows that when you get your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| if we find we've got a problem and we fix it, you get notice and you do the right thing under the new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I throw it out there for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Krista and I weeks ago kind of had a little e-mail exchange about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| It seems to me if you get a permit based on a certain set of rules that were in place at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| until you get a year-long permit, I would tend to think your permit's valid for that one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6531)|
| 1:48:59| I realize that's not what you're liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| What I'm saying is if you put it in the regulation that you get your permit subject to this reservation by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| to change it to solve whatever problem they come in with and bring it to council or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| it seems to me that you don't have a year to continue to do something that's now found to be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| What's wrong with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| We may never use that, but why not have a saving clause that says you get your permit subject to evolving regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| once you get notice and the time to react?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| That's the motion anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| I'm saying I have not researched your ability to do that for when you grant a permit under certain conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6576)|
| 1:49:44| and they pay the fees associated with that permit and gear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| There would be a legal question as to whether you could then change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| whether that presents them a vested property right that you couldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| But I'd like my situation if I was in court rather than not having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| Worst case scenario, you wait until the permit expires and then you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Isn't that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Isn't that right, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I mean, you wait until the permit expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| You can always amend the ordinance and it will take effect for all future permits issued under that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6616)|
| 1:50:23| So God's had a year permit and it's good until it expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| When it expires, then the rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| If you want to change the rules on this, you change the rules saying this will be the changed rule for all future permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| They're only good for a year anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| To get towards what Mr. DellaVope or Councilman DellaVope is saying, you could shorten the length of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| Rather than a year permit, the permit's valid for six months or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| I can make a processing nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| The staff's running in circles all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| If you want to live with it for a year, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| You've got to get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| There's a motion, but there's no second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Any second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Okay, so that fails due to lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Well, I would ask that someone from the pro-change group, I don't know who that is and who's left, address, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| the only issue I remember someone talking about, which was can you set up a temporary restaurant with tables and chairs on the sidewalk or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| I'm probably misstating that, but maybe one of you can stand up and give us a minute's worth of that suggested change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6691)|
| 1:51:39| and I guess we'll see how that fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Mr. Blattner, can you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Or Ms. Malone, someone who's not distracted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| Mr. Silverstein, I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| The whole idea of allowing tables and chairs, et cetera, on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6718)|
| 1:52:05| was that you could very easily have a situation that would be disturbing to adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6725)|
| 1:52:17| especially if you have late at night with people bringing their own music and drinking alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| and this was the kind of thing that happened at La Rumba, across from La Rumba, affected the people at Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| Now, that was not necessarily the tables and chairs, but you had a large number of people leaving that establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6750)|
| 1:52:39| when that establishment closed and were going to the food truck that was parked right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| So it's the whole idea of how if you have tables and chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| you're really changing the nature, the atmosphere around the food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| A food truck, what I understood, was to sell food to people who would then take it, eat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| or leave and take it home or take it to an office or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| So our position was that you're looking at a totally different thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| and basically creating what we called an ad hoc restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| even in places where restaurants are not even allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| So it was just another way of trying to give some additional protection to adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6803)|
| 1:53:33| So a food truck was a window service, basically, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| It doesn't turn into an informal restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| And, you know, everybody's saying 100 people could all gather at that place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| and have tables and chairs and make a party out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| And it just seems like that could cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Where would you make that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| Mr. Silverstein and Ms. Kokera, where would you make that change if you had to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| This is on page 5, division 3, section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| 3A, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Titled Additional Structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| And I think in the document they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Oh, not providing any dining area, including blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| But you could for a special event, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Currently, the ordinance says when vending on public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| the vendor shall not provide or allow any da, da, da.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| We were trying to add it to say on private property as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| you would not be allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Now, you could have on special events, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| I'm concerned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| What if you have a wedding and you want to have a food truck serve your guests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| That's a catering situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| And, again, on private residential properties, that's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| We're talking about private property meaning like a closed business at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| or even open during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| And selling to the general public as opposed to a private event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| which is you're giving away food to your guests or your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| or your clients or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| How does that get handled in 3A, if at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| What would the specific amendments be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| What would you do to change it to accomplish that suggested result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| I think in the document, there was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| did you get a copy of the document that they handed out at the beginning of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| I think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| It's on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| On page 2, the very last amendment, they provided some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| All we were really doing was adding private property to the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| of where they would not be allowed to set up the tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| So you could during a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| You just take it off the private property or the public property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| I can't do it on the public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| I get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| And then we were deleting the very last line about the vendor shall remove all additional structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| when the vendor ends its operations for the day because if it's a special event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| we would say we don't need to worry about them leaving their stuff overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| You're saying that just becomes surplus at that point, so delete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| All right, well, I'll make my motion that we adopt item 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| additional amendments on page 2 of, I guess it's COIN's April 12th submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| Community forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Yeah, community forums submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| Got to give a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| Which both of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| I think just this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| You're saying number 2 on that page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| The one is labeled 2 on the second page under additional amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| Right, prohibit vendors setting up tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Prohibit vendors setting up tables and chairs on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| Council see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| Vice Mayor Grievous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Councilman Saunders, did you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| I would like to ask the food truck vendors to make a comment about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| I'm not aware that this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| You all don't really carry tables and chairs that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| Hello, I'm Patrick Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| So for private property, what's the definition of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| Residential or a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| If you're at a private event, this rule wouldn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| If you're on a daily basis at a piece of private property where you're serving lunch or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| Okay, so when we pull up to the Knoxville Rail Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| and we pull up with our food truck and we sell food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| and they bring tables and chairs outside, that will fall into what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| You're not providing the tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| I don't carry tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| But when you go to a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| a lot of times they will set out a table and a chair for their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| It says the vendor can't provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| You can't provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| The owner can bring out whatever he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| But when the police show up to enforce it, how do they know whose tables they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| Are they mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Are they yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Or are they the goodwill drop them off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| We're getting real picky on what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| I understand it's to protect the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| But when you're on an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| and I definitely agree that we shouldn't be able to pull up in a parking lot at 2 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| and set out tables and chairs and have a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| I've yet to find one of those in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7154)|
| 1:59:24| How about the gentleman, the other gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| Kenneth Oglesby, Big O's Barbecue, 6247 Roy River Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7168)|
| 1:59:38| First of all, I want to know, what's the big stink about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| This is going on in Atlanta, Georgia, Dallas, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, about food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| People welcome food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| Knoxville is the most backwards town I've ever been to in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| We have little simple things about smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| We've been smoking for plenty of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| We love barbecuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| What happens is people love the smell of the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| That's what draws people to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| We don't take out no chairs, no tables, or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| We like to provide a service to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| So you don't care one way or the other about tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| That's not what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| I just want to sell my food to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| You open the window and you sell the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| So the issue about the smoking, I don't even care about smoking with me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| I cook my food at home, and my neighbors come to my house every time I'm cooking just to get a bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| What's that address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| 6247.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| We'll be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| But I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| This whole issue is a joke in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| But all we're talking about now is tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Well, I'm glad to talk about tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| I have tables and chairs at home, but I do not bring them with me on my food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| That's what I was trying to ask, because I'm not aware that the food trucks carry tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| If somebody else puts them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| It's not the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| It suits me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| It's the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| That's the only one that's regulated is the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| So if the Southern Railroad Station sets them up for you, that's their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| And then when you leave, they remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| Is it an issue we need to deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| I just heard Coyne mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| Yeah, you're creating a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| I mean, it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| I kind of go back to the first gentleman that said, you know, and whose responsibility is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| I mean, I think you're getting into splitting hairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| So I don't think it's necessary, and I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| So we have a motion that would prohibit vendors from setting up tables and chairs on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7321)|
| 2:02:09| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| That's the motion, and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| So if you support the prohibition, you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| If you don't support the prohibition, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| So let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| Councilman Dela Fulpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| The prohibition fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Two to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7364)|
| 2:02:52| Can we amend what was amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I think we have four amendments that actually passed, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Four amendments according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Many more votes than that, but four that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| And so now we are back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| Everybody got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| It's only been an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Come on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| There's nothing left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Just some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| That passes as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| So that's it for that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| Council, we have three more items, and then we have five people signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| so I'd like to take a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| Break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7410)|
| 2:03:41| 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 2, Article 7, Division 2, Sections 2-722,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7427)|

| 2:04:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| 12D is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley from the southwest corner of parcel 109HA-011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7452)|

| 2:04:22| and authorize the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's David C. Kearns Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| 12E is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley from North Central Street to the southwest property lines of parcels 094DQ-032| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7476)|
| 2:04:44| and 094DQ-035 and authorize the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's 835 North Central LLC Applicant Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7484)|
| 2:04:55| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| Sir, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| I just wanted to inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| I'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| My name is Joe Levitt, 825 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7510)|
| 2:05:17| And this alley, I believe, is between my property and 835.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7517)|
| 2:05:28| And in reading this ordinance, I interpreted that the quick claim deed is to be made only to 835.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7528)|
| 2:05:39| I may misconstrue that, but we have written a letter and requested that if the alley is closed, which we had no objection to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7539)|
| 2:05:51| that the property be deeded one half to each adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7551)|
| 2:06:03| The language reads quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| Pull your mic down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| It's one address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Are we talking about, oh, it has one address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| Well, it just says who the applicant is, but it says the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| I guess we need to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Maybe Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| Yeah, typically what we do is when we close rights of way and we don't own the underlying fee when we close them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7585)|
| 2:06:35| we divide it right down the middle and quick claim each side to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| And I think this provides for the property to be quick claimed to the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| So if you are an adjacent property owner, then you would get to the middle of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| The only reason I raised the question was that after the word property owners comma, there's only one address given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7614)|
| 2:07:03| That's who applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| Section two says as to the interest of the adjacent property owners, plural, may appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| Yeah, in section two, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| The operative section of the ordinance says the mayor is hereby authorized to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| and deliver quick claim deeds, that's plural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| conveying the city's interest in the aforesaid closure in conformity with this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| and as the interest of the adjacent property owners, and that's plural, may appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| So you can thank your neighbor for making the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| They actually need the alley as it is more than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| But if they want to close, we don't have any objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Okay, so we've clarified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| That is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| We're now at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| We actually had one person who gave up on us, I guess, because of the hour, so here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| Is Vinny still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| Oh, yeah, there's Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Hey, Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| Okay, so this is the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Anastacio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| I got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| I've practiced, Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Okay, then Stan Johnson, then Rhonda Goldman, and Lincoln Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| That's the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| Okay, so let me get my timer here and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| Vinny Anastacio, 2-1 Local Street Department, 1011 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| On the safety center, my concerns are traffic and the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| I'd like the city council to reconsider the location because where you're going to put it is a bad area, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| And on the security, is that basically if you're going to put a safety center, where you want to put it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7740)|
| 2:09:07| you need to put a fence around there, an alarm system, because where you want to put it is next to CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7747)|
| 2:09:15| and then you've got the —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| No, just to clarify, there is no location selected, and there's no discussion next to CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| Okay, so there's not a location yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| But when you do find a location, I'd like to have Helen Ross McNabb be in charge of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| because they really care about the people of Knoxville, and they really do a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| They've saved a lot of lives, and I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| Okay, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| I want to thank the city council for the approval of the $91 million for the Fountain City Park, the duck pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| I mean, I think it's a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| I go there a lot, and I'm glad it's going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| Okay, number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| With all the construction going on, with the water pipes being put in the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| will it be paved after and when this is done, when all the pipes are done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| And last one, and Ms. Palmer, you're going to like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| I'd like to see a new ordinance put in when it comes to KUB that says you dig it up, you pave it that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7819)|
| 2:10:28| The reason is we should not have to wait six months for it to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| It's a waste of taxpayers' money, and also it puts the people of Knoxville in jeopardy safety-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| Now, they tore up, it was Walnut and West Pine Avenue, and I called Ms. Palmer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7840)|
| 2:10:50| Okay, I asked KUB, when are you guys going to pave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| All they were doing was putting rocks and dirt down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| Now you had trolleys coming over there, and the dirt was going down, and it was creating a huge hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7859)|
| 2:11:07| And then I kept getting the runaround from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| All they did was put more dirt down and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| And the thing of it is you've got residents on West Pine Avenue, we've got residents over Summer Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| and you've got trolleys going over what they tore up on the corner of Walnut and West Pine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7883)|
| 2:11:32| All I'm asking is that the ordinance need to specifically state that if you're going to dig it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7892)|
| 2:11:42| you need to have your contractor there that very same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| And the excuses I got from KUB were basically, well, I can understand the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| Okay, if it rains, they can't do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| But the excuses I got from KUB were as followed, was we're trying to make cement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| and then it was just Mayor O'Hara, I called your office too on this, and it was like six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7923)|
| 2:12:10| And the thing of it is my main concern was you've got people who are in wheelchairs that ride the trolleys to go up to Summer Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7930)|
| 2:12:20| All right, that was my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| And if you've got a hole like that, I mean, it's really big, and then dirt's going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| and then a trolley's going over it, you've got cars going over it, you know, buses, vans, you name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| and you've got people over at the Lincoln Memorial, the law students going over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| All right, that dirt's going to keep going down and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| And then you have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| And then what's going to happen is it's going to go so far down that somebody's going to blow a tire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| and then they're going to go right over a bank bin and get killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| And who's going to take responsibility for that if someone gets killed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| Okay, that's just my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| Okay, next is Stan Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| Stan, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| As you know, you have up to five minutes, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| My name is Stan Johnson, 2805 Woodbine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| I wanted to start out by just thanking you guys for your support for our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| I run an organization called SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| It stands for Socially Equal Energy Efficient Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| We've teamed up with the city on several occasions to do a whole bunch of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| But today I want to talk to you about you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| So for what you've done, just by supporting our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| we're working with one of the most impoverished communities, 16- to 28-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Unemployment rate is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| We're helping them get jobs, and we do a career readiness program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| and we also go out in the community and talk about energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| and how you save money on your utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| First, I want to invite you over to Vestal, United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| On Thursday night we're having our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| which concludes this session of our young people's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| So they'll be over there, and you can actually see where your money is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| and see what these young people have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| and see what they're actually out there doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| and educating our community on energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| The second one, they're going to be graduating on the 28th of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8073)|
| 2:14:39| at the Square Room, and it's going to be at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| So I want to invite you guys all to come to our celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| so you can actually see what your money is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| and see how these young people's lives have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| We're going to be inviting some of the people that have hired them already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| before they even got out of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| So I just wanted to tell you guys thank you and invite you out to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| And I have tickets, by the way, for the Green Tie event if you guys want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| Thank you very much. Have a great night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Thank you, Stan. Thanks for the great work you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| Yes, sir. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| What was the time on the event Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| This Thursday the doors open at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Yep. And just check us out on Facebook and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| You guys will love it. Again, appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Now Rhonda Gallman, Ms. Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Good night, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| Rhonda Gallman, 2431 Hoyt Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| I am coming to give a follow-up on the survey that I did for Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| What I found was I went to ask some of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| and I also had a few, I guess, people in the community that were concerned about it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| about the changing of the bus route from 10 minutes to one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| Well, basically, I went in and asked some of the clients, I mean some of the residents, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| Also, I rode the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| I had a very bad experience on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| What I noticed was that I can agree with K-Trans to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| that there aren't that many people riding a bus during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| However, I would suggest that we find some kind of medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| What I was told by Cindy Pickle was that once the bus routes change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| the city is supposed to be responsible for making a walkway to the new bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| Well, no one knows when that's going to take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| or when they're going to start building it from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| I haven't asked anyone at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| However, what I ended up discovering was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| I found myself not paying much attention to the bus schedule itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| but the actual living conditions of the residents to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| I saw a bunch of health hazards there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| so I would suggest that HUD probably needs to go back in and re-expect the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| And another thing that I found is that they have an infestation of bad bugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| which could be pretty bad that has become the new household pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| So if the residents are riding a bus and they're carrying that along with the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| some of the other people that are visiting or other people riding a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| you know that's something that needs to be looked at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| However, if you go ahead and change the bus route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| what I'm afraid is that both the city and K-Trans is going to be facing several lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| due to the fact that the entrance is very dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| the sidewalks, as the gentleman said before, the sidewalks are very bad on the back side too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| So if you have someone that is handicapped or disabled that is going to be walking on those narrow sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| your sidewalk that sits on the left actually has a hydrant in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Then the one that sits on the right, it has a big pothole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| A lot of traffic comes through that one way due to the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| Also, I guess the ones that are coming to Duncan Law School as well as the Crown Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| So another thing that I thought would be bad for K-Trans is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| when the weather is bad, if they're held up, they're not going to meet their destination point on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| And if someone is sitting on the bus or trying to get on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| once you drop the lift because it sits down like that and the sidewalks in the streets are kind of cruddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| somebody kind of large could fall over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| Also, if they're going to have to go use the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| most of them will probably use the street because I don't see that they will be able to fit on that sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| But as they go around that corner going down the hill, that too can be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| So what I did not understand is the exact point where the bus was going to pick them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| and when they were going to make the walkway for them to get to the bus stop safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| and to protect them from the weather as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| So also please pay close attention to the fact that coming up a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| someone that has breathing issues or some of the women were overweight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8344)|
| 2:19:11| they would struggle probably trying to get up that hill and running out of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| So as far as the bus coming every 10 minutes, now I personally, I don't feel it has to come every 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8355)|
| 2:19:21| If there were to be a medium there, I would say 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| But majority of the people that I asked truthfully said it didn't bother them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| Also a couple of people said that it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| Mr. Lincoln was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| And some of the residents do have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| One lady mentioned to me that basically what she does is she runs errands for a lot of people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| that can't get out, and she said she doesn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| That's basically her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| So that's my outcome of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| But if they're going to do anything, I would hope and pray that you don't change the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| until you make some type of provision for them to get safely to the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| Because if not, what I'm afraid is going to happen is both K-Trans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| and the city of Knoxville will be facing some potential suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| Have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| Okay, and now Mr. Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| My name is Lincoln Lincoln, and I live at 201 Locust City, O2 Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8425)|
| 2:20:31| You'll be relieved to know that I don't intend to talk about MFUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| but I do want to kind of talk about PMUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| PMUs are people-moving units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| We ain't got no barbecue on this particular address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| Last fall, CAT and KTA started on a program to reorganize the trolley units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8450)|
| 2:20:57| They started with a program called Trolleys on Tap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| I attended five of the six of the Trolleys on Tap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| and noted how many people attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| CAT's own admission is about 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| I was there for five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| I'll buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| There was a considerable amount of interest on CAT's blog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| I'm more concerned when people get off their butts, come and talk, look at maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| than those who blog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Some of the blog entries made no sense, but CAT produced a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| The plan was very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| In many respects, it was startling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| That plan made rearrangements of the trolley routes that were drastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| in three particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| The trolleys no longer go any further north on Gay Street than Summit Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| thereby cutting off a large swath of the new development in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| and the Depot Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| In addition, cutting off transit for disadvantaged people who live in Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| Carm, Salvation Army, access to VMC, Cherokee Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| and the greater Fifth Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| People came to those meetings from Fifth Avenue, from the square above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| and asked for more trolley service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| They got zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| People came to those meetings from the apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| on the eastern end of Church Street, east of the transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8544)|
| 2:22:31| and they asked for additional service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| They got zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| Summit Towers people came, several, more than any other place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| including me, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| And Summit Towers, in that rearrangement, got zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| Zero, zero, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| It seemed to be a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| But I digress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| Summit Towers is a place where 286 souls call it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| Of the 286, 100% of those people are either disabled or elderly or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| In addition, 54% are minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| It just seemed to me that those people were not getting a square deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| Those people, many of them, about 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| came to the CAT discussion meeting on January 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| and a modified plan was hatched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| where Summit Towers would get some service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| and the eastern end of Church would get service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| but still no service north on Gay Street from Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| The impact to the people at Summit Towers is pretty drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| Presently, Summit Towers gets 42 transits a day on the CAT trolleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| Forty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| Under the new plan, Summit Towers gets seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| One trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| And knowing how CAT performs, who knows when we'll get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| because the interval between trolleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| can be anywhere from 20, 22 minutes to one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| and this happens frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| mainly because they don't know where the trolleys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| There's no GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| You people appropriated money five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| during Mayor Brown's administration to get GPS in our units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| like we have everywhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| It's even on your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| If you download the UTK app and you hit transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| you can tell where their orange trolleys are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| and you know when they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Now, to people in cars, that means nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| To somebody standing on a rainy street or pushing a walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| that means a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| There are many improvements that could be made and should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| But we're back to transit times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| While that seven servicings go on at Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| Sorry, sir, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Eighty-two transits of an empty parking lot in the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| are being done by that same CAT trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| In the daytime in the Old City, you can't throw a rock and hit a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| Transit stops at 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| That's when the Old City begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| Here's what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| I've sent four letters to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| and a petition for people at Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| I have not gotten a reply, a question, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| And I'm not happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| We need to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| We need to do it equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| These people deserve and need transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| The numbers that CAT makes saying three or four an hour is far off the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| CAT only counts entries to a trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| They don't count dispersals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| Arrivals and departures equal passenger count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| And our transit director doesn't know the difference or how to add them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| Thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| Council, that is the end of our agenda, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160412?start=8756)|
