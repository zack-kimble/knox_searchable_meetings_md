| 0:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| Your name and address, please, each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| 2418 North Central, Fresh Mart and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I'm Jeff O'Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| He's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| He's also cashier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| He's there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Mr. O'Connor has not been in for a fingerprinting and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| However, we did check him through city court records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| and city court records indicate two different convictions for sale to an underage or intoxicated person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| The first one was January 3rd of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| The second one was February 22nd of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| February 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Before I recognize you, Councilman De La Volpe, could we hear from Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I was going to ask, could we hear from Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| I think we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Mr. Frost, would you explain the problem, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| Well, the problem is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| First, Mr. O'Connor, on his part of the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| did not correctly disclose, whether intentionally or unintentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| that he had been convicted of any violation of liquor and or beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Secondly, the various beer ordinances, and specifically 4-37, precludes him for a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=413)|
| 0:07:05| I wasn't supposed to be on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I'm just the deli cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| He's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| He's the only one on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| I didn't know how my name got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Sir, you are on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| See, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| I didn't put my name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| He was supposed to be on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| I mean, I don't mean to engage in a give-and-take, but you signed it as signature of applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| and you appeared in front of the notary public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Oh, that's what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| That's the notary public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| See, I thought he took that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| I didn't know he was going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| So let's change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| We're just him on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| I'm just the deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Please step over to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| We can't hear you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| See, I thought Gary had changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| He's the only one going to be on the permit because he's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| He's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Gary used to come and go, but he's the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| And Gary's the one that filled out the paperwork when he first took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| So the only one that's supposed to be on the permit is just him because he's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| Well, we have two names on the permit or actually three names on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Geetendra Patel, Ganesan Patel, and Jeff Jason O'Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| All three names are on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| So do I have some kind of a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| Tell us what our options are, Mr. Frost, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| Well, you know, the issues right now is now we've heard from one person that he wasn't supposed to be on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=509)|
| 0:08:39| yet he's on the permit, and that only a Mr. Patel is supposed to be on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| yet we have still another person on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| I mean, it might be worth considering to put this off until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting for you all to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| who is going to be applying for the beer permit so the appropriate checks can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=537)|
| 0:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah, I like that recommendation, just postponing it 30 days until the permitting application is straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I was just going to say, don't they just have to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| I mean, in terms of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I mean, they have to redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| They have to get this issue straightened out about who is going to be on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| but they do not have to reapply and make new --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| I mean, they don't have to start over with new fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| They simply have to resubmit the application, corrected application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Well, I mean, a beer board could do it, but assuming you all do not turn them down, you know, they can try to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| Is there a problem with Mr. O'Connor being the manager with his convictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I'm not the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| I'm just deli cooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I'm the deli manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I'm not the store manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| I just do deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| I think we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| It needs to be resolved by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Counsel Mandela-Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Do I understand from Sergeant Hunter that both Jitendra Patel and Ganchi Patel, if that's the proper pronunciation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=612)|
| 0:10:21| both have clear records and they could be the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Do you all understand that, that because of your background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| that you would actually disqualify this firm from being eligible for a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| I'm just deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| That was the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Well, I understand, but that's not what the paperwork is showing us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| If you will wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| First of all, we need to vote on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| And was there a second to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| We need to vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| And then if that motion is approved to postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| then you all need to go over and talk to Ms. Martin and find out exactly what you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| then come back on July 24th with that paperwork completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Now, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| The motion needs to be to hear this on July 24th, an amended motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| not 30 days, but July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| All those in favor of hearing this on July 24th, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| On July 24th, make sure you see Ms. Martin over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Ms. Martin, do you want these or are you going to start over again, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| We'll take them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| We'll take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| I have a question on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| In Mr. O'Connor's case here where he has been cited twice for conviction with underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| and underage selling, selling to underage people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| isn't there some kind of training that people go through that this happens on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| Do we have some requirement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Not in a retail establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| That's only in a restaurant situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Now, the Drug Commission Task Force is looking at some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| but at this very moment there is not such an ordinance on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| So there's nothing we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| We have to make a recommendation that he do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| That would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I think we can make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| I'll do that in a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| And I'm sure that Ms. Hunter will help, Sergeant Hunter will help that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| The next case is Gavino's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| You'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Gavin Lawyer, 5211 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| You had a postponement because there was a little issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| and I believe that you have resolved that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Do you want to tell us about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Is this the Highland funeral thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| We're going to just get the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| And you're pretty close to having that in hand, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| So this would mean that once they have the liquor license in hand from the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| that the issue with Highland Memorial Park goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| So should we postpone it until that occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Well, I think that that is one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| A second option is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| and approve pending their receipt of the ABC license and the rest of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Because you're not ready to open, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| You're not ready to start serving tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| And you're going to have pizza and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Chicken roll latini, shrimp calamari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| It will be a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| A lot of good things to eat then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Councilman Grieve, this is another of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Is everything in order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| We still need the approval from the inspectors plus a copy of the ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Then I would move we approve pending final documentation and the ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| We'll get your licenses in the order and come back and see those ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| and you'll be in business and we'll be expecting good things on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Isn't that right, Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Thanks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| The next one is Kabuki Restaurant on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| This is also in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=881)|

| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| License approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Now we're going to District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Mr. Zip Store 541 on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| Mr. Zip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| This is 4801 on our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| 4801 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Name, Murad Ali Barwani, address 1502 Stewart Avenue in Cleveland, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Are there any records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Manager Jody Towns has not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| All the other owners and managers had no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Do you know why Mr. Towns has not been in or Ms. Towns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| Mr. Towns is on vacation right now, so I couldn't answer for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| We will get him in for a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Okay, because we can't take any further action until he comes in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| And that processing takes place on Tuesdays or Thursdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| It just needs to make an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| You need to make an appointment to get him in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| My name is Dwayne Haney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| And I'm District Coordinator for Mr. Zip, and we'll be continuing as so with Textron Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| It was my understanding that the current store managers have all been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| and have gone through the classes that are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and those store managers will be staying with the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Mr. Towns is the district manager for all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| On the application, there are four names listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Three of them have 33 and a third percent ownership, and then Mr. Towns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| Sarah Thompson was added on June the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| But as long as Mr. Towns or Jody Towns' name is on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| we can't approve this until he has been in, or is it he or she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| He.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| He has been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| So this is in your district, Mr. Kemp, and what would you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Well, like earlier, I think until the permit is filled out appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| I would move to postpone for 30 days to get it straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| And that would make it July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| You'll need to talk with Ms. Martin to find out exactly what you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| and then on July 24th, come back here, and if everything's in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| you'll very likely get your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| There is a second store here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Is it the same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Same thing, same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Now, the second, Mr. Zip, is on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and this is from Vice Mayor Pavlis' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| So I'm going to move that we postpone this one until July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| This is the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I hear that we keep these for process reuse, recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| Our tree-saving team is at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| The next one is P.F. Changs on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| This is in Councilman Grieve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| My name is Jeff Gerstenmaier, and we're at 6741 Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| Sergeant Hunter, what about the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| We just need surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Oh, Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Yeah, just, you're having a name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| What's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Corporate structure change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| What is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Yeah, they've gone from public to private, although I don't think there's an official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| It's not going to, like, an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| It's just transferring over to another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| But basically the same team is going to be in place in a new corporate form, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Does that make you feel better, Councilman De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Yeah, I was just curious about why P.F. Chang was replacing P.F. Chang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I move we accept pending documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120626?start=1162)|
