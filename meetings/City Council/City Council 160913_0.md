| 0:02:25| Any opposed? The ayes have it and that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to make sure that all of you are aware of a program we're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| actually tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. right next door in the small assembly room, that's on September 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| It'll be our first Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Award Ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| This is something, are we fixing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Can somebody deal with the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| Yeah, but I have to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| I want to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| So it'll be our first Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Award Ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| This is something generated by our Purchasing Director, Boyce Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| and the Assistant Purchasing Director, Pamela Cotham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| who joined Boyce's staff recently with a focus on disadvantaged business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| We've been working for several years to increase the amount of city purchasing and contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| that is conducted with minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| And we have had some success, but there are still some real challenges that we are intentionally working on to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| So we thought one way to encourage more disadvantaged business enterprises, or DBEs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| to compete for city business and our own department heads to really go that extra mile in looking for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| we would have an award ceremony to recognize some of the successes that we have already seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| So tomorrow we will be presenting awards to some of our local vendors and contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| as well as our city departments who are really doing a great job of working with them and hiring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| So, again, that is tomorrow at 8 a.m. in the Small Assembly Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Next week is Innovate 6-5 Week in Knoxville. Innovate 8-6-5, right? You all know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| This is an expansion of the Startup Day program begun a few years ago by the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| They still have Startup Day, but they broadened it to a full week of activities celebrating our local entrepreneurial culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| You can see the full schedule of activities at http://innov865.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=275)|
| 0:04:49| Highlights include the Mayor's Summit on Entrepreneurship, which is next Monday, September 19th, at the Mill & Mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| and we are hosting this in collaboration with the Kauffman Foundation, who are coming in and supporting us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| And that event will be followed by the Knoxville Makers City Summit with Etsy, also at the Mill & Mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Startup Day itself will take place on Thursday, September 22nd, from 2-5 at the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| It's always fun. It's always inspiring to watch these entrepreneurs pitch their dream projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Hopefully you can come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| There's a lot more going on during the week, so again, go to the website, which is http://innov865.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=325)|
| 0:05:38| So next Wednesday, September 21st, at 4 p.m., we'll have a ribbon-cutting and open house at the historic Administration Building at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=338)|
| 0:05:48| As you all know, we've been working to renovate that building in recent months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Now it is finished, and we have moved some of our City Parks and Recreation staff in there, as well as some other city functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=353)|
| 0:06:03| There is an opportunity to come out and appreciate the history of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| but it will also be a chance to get an update on the Lakeshore Park Master Plan from members of the Lakeshore Park Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| So that board is raising a lot of private funds for us to leverage the city dollars we have put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| and there are some projects about to get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| So come on out to Lakeshore Park Administration Building next Wednesday, September 21st, at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| So now we have some guests with a unique presentation to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=391)|

| 0:07:14| Our chapter was founded in 1975 and is a non-profit educational organization of approximately 100 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| that promotes the art of embroidery through classes, exhibitions, and preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| We help Girl Scouts working on the sewing badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=450)|

| 0:08:48| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| I'm proud of you all and what you do to help the Girl Scouts and so many other people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| As I head back up there, I want to invite Visit Knoxville, Kim Bumpus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and Visit Knoxville to come on down as I'm heading up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| They also have an interesting message for us, an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=543)|
| 0:09:16| Mayor, maybe you can use this opportunity to take classes with the Guild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| I knit, but I don't embroider, but now I'm going to have to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I need some lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| They're too afraid to get up, so I'm just going to recognize them in their right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Eric, what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Well, if everyone will look at the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| this is a video we made from our annual presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=590)|
| 0:10:21| Catchy tune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| Cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| New place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=639)|
| 0:10:59| New place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=659)|
| 0:11:29| New place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=689)|
| 0:11:59| Well, as you can see, that was from our annual meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=719)|
| 0:12:13| so we've already gotten new visitor spending numbers since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| That said, $988 million, but we were just at a state press conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| where Knox County broke a billion in visitor spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| so that's a very exciting time for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| We're also coming off double-digit hotel-motel collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| We're up 11% closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Is that me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| This past fiscal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| It's getting crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| But as I was saying before that video started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| the team that really is responsible for this is right here in this row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Do you all please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Make them stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| It's with their leadership, with their teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| that really makes this all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Some other exciting things that we have going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| we just announced today free Wi-Fi at the Knoxville Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| so that is going to be a game-changing opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| as we look to new events in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| because one of the biggest things we would run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| is they had free Wi-Fi at other venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| So through a partnership with Visit Knoxville and SMG and ShowNets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| we were able to bring that to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So we'll be really excited in October when that's actually live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| We've also invested in sport court, for those of you that don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| and that means we'll be able to build our own basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| and volleyball courts in the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| and even other venues and host tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| We will be announcing a series of new basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| and volleyball tournaments in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| You also saw Bassmasters on the video, so that's very exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=821)|

| 0:14:25| Yeah, I hope you'll add some banjo music to your introductory thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| You know, we had that in there, but I took it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| because I didn't think you would like it, but we'll put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=872)|

| 0:15:11| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| I just wanted to announce the last event of the summer for Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| It's going to be 6 o'clock a week from tonight, September 20th, at Trailhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| It's going to be a ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| So come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Bring your bike if you need a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=929)|

| 0:15:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Councilman Delivoping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I just want to remind folks that on September the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| at the O'Connor Senior Center off of Winona Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| we're going to have the North and East Knoxville Economic Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| And we simply hope to bring together the neighbors and residents of this quadrant of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| together with business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| And folks are going to express their desires on what they would like to see that serves their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| And we're going to hear from businesses on what they would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| or need in order to successfully do business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| But this quadrant has 48,000 people as residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| and there are 110,000 residents or people within a 15-minute drive of the center of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| So it is an important area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| and we're hoping to see more healthy East Knoxville and North Knoxville business growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| We hope you can attend the conference, 530 to 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| There will be a meet and greet from 5 to 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| You can come a little early and meet folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| We're now on ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| 9A is an ordinance to appropriate the sum of $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| from the Parks and Recreation Department's Grant and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| and donate the same towards the sponsorship of Legacy Parks Foundation's 2016 Legacy Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| We are now on our appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| So we will start with the first one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Maha M. Ayesh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| to reduce the minimum number of required parking spaces from 43 to 0 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| per submitted plan to permit brewery-slash-restaurant in an existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| in a C3 district property located at 100 Lockett Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| So this is an administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and so the process is that each side, if there is somebody here to speak against your appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| then we first hear from the appellant, from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and then you can have up to three speakers, up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and then the other side can respond, and if there is another side who speaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| then you have an opportunity to rebut for up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| But thank you for being here, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| My name is Maha M. Ayesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| My address, I'm sorry, it's spelled M-A-H-A, my first name, last name is spelled A-Y-E-S-H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and my address is 205 Lockett Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you, Madam Mayor and respected City Council members for allowing me to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| I have filed an appeal of a zoning variance that was granted on the street on which I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| The property at issue is an old garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| That's basically the only commercial spot on an otherwise residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| It has residences as well as a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| and this one piece of property that functioned as a garage for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| and has been vacant for a while, there was in July an approval to grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| The proposed establishment is described as a brewery and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| I'm going to refer to it as a bar because that's what I see it as, it's a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| It's a bar that's going to be built on an otherwise residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| The zoning ordinance at issue is essentially to allow the bar to be built with zero parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| and the applicant has said that he has an agreement with the neighboring church to allow use of their parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| I understand that they're required to have 43 parking spaces, and so he wants to have zero parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| As I understand the regulations in regards to variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| that a variance is to be granted if enforcing the variance would deprive the property owner of any beneficial or reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1182)|
| 0:19:51| But in addition to that, you have to take into account the general purposes and intent of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| and that granting this variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood or detrimental to the public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1197)|
| 0:20:06| I submit to you that I don't think there was any established facts to show that it would deprive the property owner of reasonable use of his land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| if he was not given this variance, that there's additional uses of the property other than as a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| I agree that probably it would deprive a bar of being able to be established without the parking that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| but that there's other uses of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| In addition, we ask, and the main reason why I'm here is that you consider that it would be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| and I say that as a resident of that street, someone who has small children who play outside on that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| not on the road, of course, but in the yard, I have with me several other members of my, some of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| and I'd like for them to stand up, those who came in support of our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| I have two people who would like to speak on behalf of the appeal, and they'll be coming to speak after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| But we'd like you just to consider, I've submitted some pictures that show the proximity of the property to the neighboring houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| that the proposal to allow parking at the nearby church is not a reasonable solution to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| that essentially we'll then have people, up to 43 cars essentially, parking at the church across the street from my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| and that they'll be having to walk to the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| And I hope that you can see, and I'm hoping that if you've got the materials that I submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| that the pictures would show that it's not really a reasonable solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| as well as the fact that just the church parking lot is used in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| There was an AA meeting there last night, and there was parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| there were several cars that were already parked at the church that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| And to allow this to be, we're going to have people parking at the church, walking in the grass or on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1312)|
| 0:22:01| And again, what is an otherwise residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| The street does connect Kingston Pike and Dean Hill, which are busy roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| and is of higher traffic than most residential streets for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| But to allow this kind of variance when it's not been shown that it's really necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| and just to submit that the applicant has the burden of proving that it's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| and I just don't think that's been shown, and we ask that you consider the effect that it will have on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| and the well-being of the public in making your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| And I'd like to now ask Mr. Gene Harrell, who lives directly across the street from the property at issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| and he'd like to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| And just to make sure, the next person would be Reem Abolrezak, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| Yeah, it would be Layal Abolrezak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Abolrezak, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| All right, go ahead, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| And I'm going to set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| My name is Gene Harrell, and I'm at 6011 Crest Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| And I live 115 feet and 2 inches from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| Now, how would you all like to have a bar 115 feet and 2 inches from your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| I've lived there for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| It's been a real quiet neighborhood, been a pleasant place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| but it's all going to change when the bar moves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| And when they can't park over in that church that's next door, they're going to park in my yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| and we're going to have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And I'm not going to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| And whatever it takes, it'll happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| But 115 feet and 2 inches from my house to the front door of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| Now, I'm still working, and I've got to sleep at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| And the racket is going to be loud as close I am to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| And I know I'm going to have people come down through my yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| and there may be someone parked in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| And I just want to ask the council to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| My name is Layal Abdarazik, and I live at 201 Lockett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| And they're planning to build a bar and restaurant in front of my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| and I usually play outside with my cousins and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| And I don't think it would be safe if they built it because there'll be reckless driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and I just won't be safe if we played outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| And also, during the night, there'll be lots of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| and I don't think I'll be able to get any sleep, and it'll affect my school grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Can I ask how old you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| He likes to get up here at age 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Okay, so now is anybody here to speak in opposition to the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Please come on up and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| And, again, you'll have up to three people, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| My name is Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| I'd like to commend her for getting up and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| It takes a lot of guts when you're 41 years old to get up here and speak sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| I'm here with Jesse Bowers, and we have Brett Honeycutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| He's the architect and technically the original applicant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| You've heard the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| The property at Issue 100 Lockett Road is zoned C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| which has several enumerated uses, all of them which require parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| The problem with this lot is there is no parking for the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| So regardless of the use, there has to be parking available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Now, I hope I submitted a packet to the city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| and I hope that you guys have that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| You can see an aerial photograph, and it looks like there might be parking in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| but actually most of that is in the city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| There is not available parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| There is some discussion, and I know you have the transcript of the BZ-8 hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| There's some discussion that there may be you can squeeze one or two parking spots on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| but I think our architect would disagree that you can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| and that it would require a variance no matter what the use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Now, the brew pub is specifically something that's under the C3 zone that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| The determination of what use is appropriate for this location is not what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| The issue is are we deprived of beneficial use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| It's been vacant for, as the appellant said, several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| because no one can go in there with legal use without the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| It's owned by Mr. Cappiello, and he's been attempting to lease it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| and Mr. Bowers here has got this concept where he's going to operate a brew pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| and a full menu restaurant on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| The beer is going to be brewed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| It's craft beer, I think, less than 5% alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| The business model is a model of moderation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| The hours are limited, and we have the parking agreement with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| which limits when the parking can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| There is currently being built a pedestrian path between the church and the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| which it's not completed yet, but it will be cobblestone or pavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| well lit so there will not be anybody accessing it directly on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| No one's going to be parking in anybody's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| That's why we need the parking agreement with the church to have the 43 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| There is an easement with Bushman Chiropractic right behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| that allows parking after 6 p.m. for eight spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| However, these are what we call shared spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| and they don't technically comply with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| So without this variance, there's no use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Any use in the C3 zone would require parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| and that's what we're asking for is a reduction from 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| which is what's required for a 4,200-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| Now, I'm having the same problem you are, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| If we were putting in a deli or a delicatessen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| which is also in the same enumerated use under the C3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| we would be here asking for the same variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Well, I appreciate the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| and I understand the perception of this being a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| but this is really a craft brew in a full-service, full-menu restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and the use is specifically contemplated and allowed under the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| So we would ask that it was approved 5-0 by the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| and we'd ask that the appeal be denied and that the variance be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Mr. Powers, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| So that's all? You don't want to—nobody else wants to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| We'd be happy to answer any questions about the use or the allocation of parking or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Okay, why don't we go ahead and hear their—do you want to ask a question now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Just while he's standing there, just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Is this the area you were talking about, this kind of bluish color thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| It looks like it is, but it's hard to see. I've got one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Yeah, okay, and there's a red building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| That's the one you're talking about on the upper left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| No, the red building, I think, is the Western Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| There is a red arrow at 100 Lockett Road on that, and that's the actual building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| Okay, because I was going to say it looks like there's parking at what is the Western Union structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| but how did they run a business here without parking before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| How do you have a mechanic shop and you've got cars coming and going and waiting to be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Where do they sit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Well, I mean, there is a space—the only thing we can surmise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and we don't know the answer to that, is that they were parking in the city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| which isn't legally allowed parking, but obviously something was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| On Lockett Road in the face of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| At the front, you can see on Lockett Road there is a wide concrete strip there that is actually in the city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| and I believe Mr. Honeycutt can probably add some clarity to that if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Yeah, I was just curious because I was thinking that there had to be some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I'm sorry, Brent Honeycutt, 8000 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| In the past, there was parking there, but with the changes of zoning and change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| the city engineering won't allow it anymore, so basically it all goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Is there any other use for this building other than commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| The use, it's zoned C3, and under C3, all those uses would require parking, which is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| If I could ask one other question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Dan Kelly, can you tell us anything about this unusual situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| We've got a commercial building with no parking as part of the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| I realize that they're talking about they've got an agreement to use the neighbor's parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| but the existing lot and structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Looking at the building, it looks like it was probably built in the 40s or 50s, somewhere in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| It operated as an auto repair facility for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| As Mr. Mullins said, most likely they used the city right-of-way for their parking with the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| that were there waiting to be repaired or the ones that were completed and waiting for the owners to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| The building itself has been zoned C3 for as long as I can recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1922)|
| 0:32:15| and primarily because the garage that was located in it required C3 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| and that's why you have a piece of C3 zoning back on Lock and Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Do you all want to go ahead and ask or hear the rebuttal first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| What is the distance between the church and the brew pub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| We haven't measured it exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| It's within 300 feet, and, of course, there will need to be a license with the TBAC regarding that distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| And, of course, those are things that we would have to get and acquire in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| that would be dependent upon us being able to go forward with our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| I wanted to talk about the parking agreements that you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| You supplied those, and talk a little bit about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| because you've got a permanent parking agreement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| It's not a term parking agreement. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| It's basically a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I mean, it is indefinite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| It can be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I mean, and I can assure you if the concerns and things they raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| the appellants raise about it being a wild bar and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| then the church can then take away that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| And even though we have variance, we won't have parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| and if you don't have parking, the business isn't going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| So the church could revoke it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Yes, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| They have the right to revoke that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And the same with the chiropractor's office as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| That is an easement for eight spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Only eight spaces per the easement, and that's been attached also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| We only have parking after 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| That's to the back of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| So how do you plan to pull up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I'm not going to know where to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| I mean, how do you plan to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| and how they know where to park and where to walk and all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Jesse Bowers, 6055 Tennyson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| It would just be a lot of customer education, social media, very good signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| just having to get the message out there and getting people going the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| It will definitely take some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So you're going to have designated spaces at the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| They're not designated spaces, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| We have full use of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Full use of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| How late will you be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| What were your hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| I don't think we've got it firmly in place what our hours will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| but we have a floor and a ceiling established with our parking agreement with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| as to when we are allowed to park there and what our hours would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| And that's part of the packet I presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| The hours are Wednesday and Thursday, 4 to 10 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Friday, 4 to 12 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Saturday, 12 to 12 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| and Sunday, 12 to 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| is what the parking agreement with the Presbyterian Church allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| Now, I don't know if those are actually going to be our hours or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| What was the Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| The Saturday, 12 p.m. to 12 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| which is less than is normally operated for a restaurant or a brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2135)|
| 0:35:45| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Are you going to have any outdoor activities, patios, or anything along those lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| All the garage doors lift up, so we are going to raise those from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| There will be outdoor seating out in front of the building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| No loud music, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Music?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| No, I don't plan on having music there, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I want to be a great neighbor, and I want everyone to appreciate the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and I want to fit in there and be a good part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Okay, so now thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| And now the appellate gets up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| I did just want to point out that there was no opposition at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| because we didn't find out about it until after the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| There was no notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| And I understand that legally just a blurb in the newspaper is sufficient for public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| but generally there is a sign put on the property saying there's going to be a hearing on a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and there was no sign in this case in regards to the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| So none of us who live on the very street where this is being done knew anything about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| until after the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| And now we're kind of blindsided with this idea that we have to adjust to this extremely different use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2217)|
| 0:37:06| It's going to be a significantly different use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| It's going to be right across the street from where we live and where our children play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| And I understand business concerns about the parking, but you can't ignore, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| it's not just the use of the land that's not the only factor to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| It has to be for the public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| It has to be, it cannot be injurious to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| We're highly concerned that it will be injurious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And if you look at the parking lot itself of the church, it's a very wide parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| The spaces, for whatever reason, the church parking lot takes up a large chunk of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| And so people are going to be walking across the entire parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| It's just something, living there across the street from it, seeing it every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I'm having a very, very hard time imagining how this is reasonably going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| that people are going to know when to park, where to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| without it affecting negatively the residents around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Okay, council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| So, Dan, Zone C3, I mean, they have the use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| And so that's not in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| The zoning is in place for this to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| We're not, we can't contest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And we have, what are our options on parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I mean, they have to get a, they have to have a parking agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Would people buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I don't know what our options are as far as how can we disallow it when it already has the zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2318)|
| 0:38:48| I mean, give us some help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Any use that goes in there will need to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| By virtue of the fact that they are changing use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| they've lost any preexisting status, if they had any preexisting status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| before, by changing from the auto repair facility to any other use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| So, from that standpoint, they are going to have to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| There are a number of uses in the Z3 zone that would not require as many parking spaces as a restaurant would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| but at the same time, they're going to have to have a variance, most likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| in order to operate any business at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Because the parking now has to comply not only with numbers of parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| but also the design of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| And that's the issue that they have, is that they can't design a parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| they might be able to get one or two handicapped spaces on the property, and that'd be about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| So the preexisting condition was, we're saying it was an auto repair shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| If you'll notice in the package of materials that we sent to you, or was part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Lockett Road is also known as Old Kingston, or was Old Kingston Park at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| That garage probably relates back to the time when that may have been a portion of Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| So some use is going to take, other than an auto repair shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| they could go back in there and park on the city right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| Peter would be the man that would answer that for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| but by virtue of the fact that it's been vacant for two years, they've probably lost all preexisting status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| So whatever use goes in there is subject to making some type of parking arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2444)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Hearing from the neighbors was certainly difficult, and I empathize with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| but I'm not going to be able to support the appeal, really for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| One, the issue is really the parking, and it sounds like the opposition is really based upon the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| It's not the fact that it's a restaurant without parking, it's the fact that it's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| And then just in terms of a couple of points, there's no use of this property without some type of variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| And I think if you think about what we're trying to do with parking, we're getting ready to look at parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| These are some of the issues that come up with our current parking code, and it requires a tremendous amount of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| I mean, surface parking is tremendously bad for the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| It eats up space, makes areas less walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| What these owners are trying to do with sharing parking, I think, is exactly what our new parking ordinance is trying to promote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| is the sharing of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| A church are notorious for building huge parking lots because they get big crowds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| but they only occupy those spaces on Sundays or Wednesdays, so this is making use of that valuable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2533)|
| 0:42:24| And then lastly, I think if you look at it in one way, I mean, you're changing a garage to a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| I think that's, you know, a lot of people would see that as a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| I mean, you know, they'd rather have a restaurant open near them than a repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| So it's certainly a difficult issue, but it sounds like the path between the restaurant and the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2563)|
| 0:42:55| it looks like it's going to be off the road somewhat, and then hopefully at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| you know, we'd be able to build sidewalks along the road to encourage this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| But I'd be interested in what my colleagues have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| Councilman Dallivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| I wonder if the owner's representative can step up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Just curious, how far along is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Have you actually leased the property for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| or is it all contingent on you getting the parking approval and the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| Where are we in terms of this business establishing itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| I've been working on opening this for about eight months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| I've signed a three-year lease, and I'm very far into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| I really need this, honestly, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Was the prior parking on the little pad right in front of those garage doors that shows in one of these pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| It was like a concrete pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Is that where the parking was before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Yes, that's in the city right-of-way, the majority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Have they widened the road there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| It's just part of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| It's just part of the right-of-way, which means we can't have legal parking there in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| It was used informally but not necessarily legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| That's our understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Well, let me talk to the same question that Marshall did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| and that is I'm concerned about these neighbors having this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| He may be right in saying that perhaps a restaurant and related activity is less noisy or heavy commercial than a repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2669)|
| 0:44:39| On the other hand, it is in the middle of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Now, I do notice that that block that runs from Lockett Road to Abundant Drive back to Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| looks like most of everything in there is some form of either commercial or, in the case of the church, the church's use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| So that's sort of curious to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Mr. Kelly, was that whole block Remain Zone C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Is that that kind of square block from Kingston Pike down to Abunda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| You know, the area around Abunda, that's where Bonefish and that small shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| and then that area of the oil change facility, there's a veterinarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| I think there's a cash advance of some kind along that same strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| So it is a sort of a commercial or neighborhood commercial area that has been there for some time, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| That changes it somewhat for me just because it was sort of an accepted use in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| and not someone buying a lot and converting a house, for example, to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| This is something I guess you would have an expectation of some traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Yeah, I'll make a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| We have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Is there any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Is the effect of that to approve what the BZA did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| If you deny the appeal, you approve the variance from BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| If you vote aye, that will approve the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| So it's 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| The motion to deny the appeal passes 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| 10B is a resolution approving an appeal by Paige Coleman of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to deny a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| to reduce the minimum required front yard setback for a ground sign from 10 feet to 0 feet per submitted plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| to permit a new ground sign in a C4 district property located at 7824 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| Paige Coleman, applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| Okay, is Paige Coleman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| The appellant, Paige Coleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| I know we have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| You didn't mark it, Ms. Fell, but you are against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| You're against the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| We don't have anybody here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| Okay, so the person, the appellant is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| So we will go on to the respondent side, which would be Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| Ms. Feld, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| You have up to five minutes to speak to the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| My name is Joyce Feld, and I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2880)|
| 0:48:09| This has gone before BZA twice already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| I don't dispute that Ms. Coleman provides a valuable service to the community through her business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| but as do hundreds of other businesses throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Nevertheless, Scenic Knoxville is opposed to this variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| I don't see that this request is in compliance with the standards for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| stated in Article 7, Appendix B, Section 2 of the ordinance, and which I think you have in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Do you have those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| There are over 32 feet from the edge of the pavement to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| so there's more than enough room to meet the setback requirement as stated in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| This area between the building and the right-of-way, it's asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| and actually it's blocked off to traffic by concrete barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| so it's not used to accommodate either drive-through traffic or parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| I recognize that there are some KUB easements in the area that have to be taken into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| but there's still adequate room to place this sign and have it be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| I would also note that this business has the benefit of a very large, legal, non-conforming roof sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| which makes the business very visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| I was looking for it, and I admit I was actively looking for it as opposed to being just drive-by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| but I spotted it immediately from the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| It's very easy to spot, and there's nothing obstructing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| It's legal non-conforming because, first, it's a roof sign, which is no longer allowed under the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| and it's also greater than 10% of the square footage of the primary facade of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| That sign is not at issue here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| That sign is preexisting, and it's legal, but the business does have the benefit of that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| The applicant has claimed that our business increased 200% during the time the ground sign was installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| and then it dropped again once it was taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| And I will just note that they did install a ground sign without seeking a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| It was built by, I think, the applicant's boyfriend and somebody else in a garage and put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3020)|
| 0:50:30| Not only do we not have proof of this increase, this 200% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| but the illegal sign face was apparently, as best I can determine, only there for about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| So statistically speaking, this is not a long enough time to draw any valid conclusions about the impact on her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| There are two other successful businesses in the same complex, and neither have a ground sign on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| and they also don't have the benefit of a large roof sign facing Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| because they're not fronting Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| They're on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Frankly, in our opinion, this is an example of a business that's engaging in that unwinnable sign race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| where everyone wants a bigger, more visible sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| And as you well know, the sign ordinance was written and passed to benefit the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| by reducing sign clutter and making our city more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| Scenic Knoxville respectively requests that this variance be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| I would also like to note that you are hearing this appeal in a quasi-judicial manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| and not in a legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| And if City Council does decide to vote in favor of the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| I would ask that you please cite the standard or standards of variances from Article 7, Appendix B, Section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| that's in your packet, that allows this appeal to be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Thank you, Ms. Sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Okay, so again, Paige Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| Apparently not here, so we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| I noticed a sign that was on the roof, and I forgot that it was illegal nonconforming, and that was a big surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| But that sign is very visible from Kingston Pike going east to west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| and from Winston Drive going toward Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| So to me, this is an example of someone trying to skirt the sign ordinance that we labored so long and intently to promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3147)|
| 0:52:38| So I would move that we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I have no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| I guess I'm going to ask Dan Kelly a question for starters since he's here and is now a victim, so we can pick on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| No, I'm teasing Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| The sign in the picture that's on this page 51, the small sign with the looks like four by fours holding it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| that's the temporary sign that they were talking about that's just there to show whereabouts of where they want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Or is that something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| I would defer to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| His department handled this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| That's right, and he was at the hearing, I guess, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Peter Ahrens, would you join us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| You probably can't see it from here, but there's a wooden-looking sign that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| I believe we issued a temporary sign permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| That's why it was there for a short period of time, and then it was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| And as I read the debate in the BZA record, there's something about that section from the sidewalk or shoulder through the grassy area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3226)|
| 0:53:55| that's a KUB easement and it can't be built upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| There's a sewer and water easement or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| There is a sewer easement through there, and actually our engineering department, one of the engineering examiners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| Mr. Johnson was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Well, he was, and I actually spoke with him while I interacted with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| He spoke with KUB, and they're not very concerned with installing a sign in that vicinity because it's only 4x4 posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3254)|
| 0:54:24| It didn't look like a massive structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| And I guess they have the right, if they have to do maintenance, to just dig it up and then put it back or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| But what Ms. Fell said, and she may have to answer this, is the property has this 32-foot wide section from the edge of the grass, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| to the concrete in the building that they could put the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| They have 32 feet from the front of the building to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| Is the property line the grassy area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Include that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| It's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| So they could put a similar type sign, whatever is allowed face-wise in the ordinance, just back a few feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| So they're not deprived of having a pole sign if they need one to attract their customers' attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| So what is the magic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Do you know what the magic is of having it there as opposed to back 10 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| It's a setback of 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| 10 feet, that was all it's, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| It's not a 25-foot setback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| It's 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| I'm going to support Councilmember Palmer's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| But I was curious, I don't know if Dan Kelly or who should answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| what's the purpose of having the 10-foot setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Is that a safety or is it primarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| The idea is to have the signs set back in order to be able to have traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| be able to have a line of sight underneath the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Yeah, I'm going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| I think if we allowed this, it might seem like a lot of businesses right on that block that don't have signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| would all be wanting signs sort of right on the sidewalk that would follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| So I'll be supporting the motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| We have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| The appeal is denied by a vote of 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Moving on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with IPR, Southeast, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3395)|

| 0:56:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| necessary to purchase a permanent drainage easement within certain real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| located at 4405 Candor Avenue from Rogers Group, Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| for a total amount of $2,440 as part of the Neighborhood Drainage Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Councilman Della Botha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Question for Jim Hagerman or I guess Mr. King is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| It says that we have eight different sites throughout the city that we're working on this drainage work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| and then there's a note under the project schedule that construction can begin after completion of the right-of-way phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| but you already have 12 of the 15 easements or 11 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Can any of these projects start sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Is there a hold that you have to get them all under your belt in terms of easements before you can issue the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| Well, we have a consultant that designed these and they're all in one set of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| So if we pull some of them out, we'd have to pay the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| It's not eight little projects under one roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| It's one big design project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| It's one project in eight different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| You more or less have to complete your acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| What's the timetable for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| We think we're very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We have two more to go and we should be able to let the project later on this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3496)|

| 0:59:51| I don't know if Mr. Shields is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Mr. Johnston is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| If I could speak with that gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| As you're walking up, my question is I realize you've got five, I guess, diesel trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and you're trying to get five new ones that are cleaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| and have certain protections for particulates and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| One of the trucks only has 34,000 miles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| That seemed like an awfully new truck to me to be, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| tossed out into the woods somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| I assume you're going to resell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I'm sure we're not tossing it into the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| But they're $150,000 trucks you're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| Is there any reason why we can't ride that devil a little longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| I'm Jeff Johnston with Fleet Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| The grant is through TDOT for CMEC money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| and in this instance the grant is going to make us destroy the engines of the diesel trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| because they are very dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Oh, you cannot simply sell it as a used truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| We can sell it as scrap but not as a used truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| Do they take the engine out and put a new one in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| No, we are not going to do anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| We will make it to where the engine is unusable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| and then we can sell the remaining hulk as a scrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| You're right that some of the vehicles have low mileage on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Yeah, some of them have 90,000 and they're more used, but this only has 34,000 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| I mean a Cummins diesel or one of those can go for a couple hundred thousand miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| These are actually cat diesels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Cat diesels, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| These are definitely a dirtier engine that we're choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| So the goal is cleaner air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Yes, cleaner air, cleaner fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| What's the estimated value of the fleet we're chopping up and putting in the scrap metal pile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| We actually purchased these vehicles for $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Oh, not $150,000, the old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| No, the $150,000 is the new trucks that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| A good portion of that is because we're getting the grant for the CNG propane systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| that we'll be putting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| And this is a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Do you sell the truck body without an engine or is it just over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| It's over once you take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Once we destroy the engines, we're going to go ahead and just sell them either on gub deals or at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an amendment to contract number C-14-0071| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation regarding the South Knoxville Waterfront Roadway Improvements Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| to modify the funding source from high-priority project funding to state surface transportation block grant funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| increasing the federal funding by $1,642,684 and the local match by $410,672 for a new total project cost of $7,511,063.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3755)|
| 1:02:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to an agreement with Malia Engineering Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| for structural engineering services and assessment of the former sanitary laundry and dry cleaning facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| located at 625 North Broadway to add additional services and to increase the contract amount by $16,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| for a total contract amount not to exceed $47,862.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I thought maybe it was just an opportunity to provide an update on the timeline of where this property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Ann Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Good evening, Mayor and Member of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Ann Wallace, Deputy Director for the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| We are currently in the process of our cooperative agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| You'll recall that it also has some environmental issues associated with its use as a laundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| and we did receive $240,000 of grant money to be able to clean the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| It's $200,000 from EPA and $40,000 local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| We also worked with the Industrial Development Board to secure funding to replace the roof of this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| recognizing that after it sat vacant for nominally a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| there's some significant work both from the structural standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| and also from the architectural standpoint for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| It is eligible potentially for the National Register of Historic Places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| so it's important for us to make sure that we do this work correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| and that we preserve important components of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| and that's part of the reason why we have reached out for these architectural services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| in addition to the structural engineering services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| So going forward, how long? How many more months or years are we looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Sure. Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| We have to have a new roof on the building within the next probably 6 to 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| That's our first priority because obviously that's very important to the structure overall to maintain its viability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| The EPA grant requires us to hold the property until either the completion of the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| which is a three-year timeline, or we finish ahead of that and are able to move the property forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| So we're looking at about a three-year timeline on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Certainly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Anne, I'm glad that we're tackling a derelict building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| but how much money are we putting into this and what are we going to get out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| What are we left with at the end of the day after it's all fixed up and remediated and a new roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| I mean, are we going to sell it? What are we doing with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| Yes, we'll put the property out through an RFP process similar to the State Supreme Court site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| which you'll recall that we spent $2.7 million on in acquiring that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| as it is a key location in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| This property we're set up to expend about $800,000 on the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| and we've leveraged the $200,000 EPA grant to then move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| It is at a critical location right at the intersection of Broadway and Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| and the turnaround that the downtown north area is seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| especially as we move from downtown and the McClellan Warehouse site northward on Broadway towards Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| and then on into both the districts on Central and Broadway as they redevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| So it's a critical piece of property that we look forward to putting out for a request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| and seeing that become a very economically viable piece of property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| Do we have any kind of appraisal of what a fixed-up building is worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| No, because part of the challenge is when property has environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| that's not typically accounted for in an appraisal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| You're fixing those, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| So it won't have environmental problems when you sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| I think it's a bit premature to try and estimate what the building would be worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| but as we see the market in Happy Holler is turning around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| and so are a number of the properties up and down Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| even extending from the Magnolia Avenue area up to this portion of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| I think we will find ourselves in a good position when it's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Well, I hope we turn a buck on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Well, and remember, the other issue here is the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| the current negative impact and the future negative impact that it would have on adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| And so we think even bigger than just this property, the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| Stimulus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| There's more to consider than just the individual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| I didn't know if we had the scenario mapped out where we'd end up with a million-two building or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4048)|

| 1:07:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| and accept a grant award of $5,000 with no required local match from the U.S. Lacrosse Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| to fund development of an inner-city girls' youth lacrosse team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Move for move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4073)|

| 1:07:58| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, Deputy Chief Holliday, for pursuing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| 12A is an ordinance amending Chapter 7.5, Article 2, Rules of Procedure, Section 7.5-87, Rule 26, Filling Vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4083)|
| 1:08:13| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4094)|

| 1:08:16| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| I would like Rob to tell us exactly why we're changing this rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| Yes, thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Briefly, back in 2012, the Council passed some rules better laying out how replacements of Council members would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4104)|
| 1:08:35| and people who would provide Council with the services that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| This is correcting the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| I'm happy to man up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| It put it in conflict with the Charter how many votes it took to appoint a replacement member to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| If we'd gotten to that situation, the Charter would have ruled the day, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| and this is just simply removing that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| So it's housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Housekeeping, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| 12B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the west side of Henley Street, south side of Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| north side of West Hill Avenue from R3-D1 District to C2-D1 District, Church Street, United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4167)|
| 1:09:36| Applicant 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Council, we now have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Did we do the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| We did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Okay, I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Yeah, at the beginning it was just one that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| I'm glad to always check to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Okay, so public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| We have two people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Is Mr. Presley here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Is Xavier Presley here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| We do not see him, so we'll move on to Mr. Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| Mr. Emmons, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| You know our procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| State your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| My name is Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike, Apartment J1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| It's on the south side of Knoxville here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| First, thank you for everything you do for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Again, I want to thank you for striving to do what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| As an example, thank you for seeking to find agreement between the residents of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| and those trying to develop successful enterprises in the city, as we saw an example of this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4254)|
| 1:11:03| You often demonstrate a listening ear, aiming to do what's best for the city as well as those involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| whatever the issue may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| It's also clear that you want to exercise discernment, making decisions, requesting to see detailed plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4273)|
| 1:11:23| to ensure that what's being promised is what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| This is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| As you and many of us here continue to seek the welfare and growth of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| it seems reasonable to also continue reflecting on what it means for the city to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| If everyone in the city had a nice home, a nice car, and a full-time job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| would that mean that the city is doing well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| What if everyone, let's say two-thirds of these houses, are full of bitter conflict every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| or people who love themselves above everyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| This pushes me to question the thought that material success for ourselves is the best goal in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| Most of us would probably not say that's what we live for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| but I know for myself I can kind of tacitly believe that everything will be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| I'll plan on that future when I'm so much financially better off than I am now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| and think that that's when life's really going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| But is it possible that we need help defining good living from outside of ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4359)|
| 1:12:49| Are we in too modern of a time to think maybe God is real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4369)|
| 1:13:00| There's a couple places in the Bible where I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| if we can think that maybe that's a reasonable document, trustworthy possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| where it describes this topic of success well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| It says, better is a dry morsel, better is a dried piece of bread than a house full of feasting with strife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| I think we would know that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure with trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| That seems okay, but how do we have that quietness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| It's easy to have strife, right, whether we have a little or a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| This is where grace comes in to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| God showing us grace is him caring for us and giving us good gifts in spite of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| It means we can be free from self-loving or self-loathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| It means we can be free from destructive thinking or addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Can you imagine Knoxville free of destructive living and addiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| It also means not admiring each other's manicured lawns or expensive trendy clothes or cars or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| I saw you at the golf course the other day, we're doing so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| But it means caring for each other selflessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| and often at the expense of the pursuit of our own welfare or our own entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4473)|
| 1:14:43| A lot of times I want to watch a movie instead of help somebody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| So do we want to care for people as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| And where can our help come from, the help that we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| How can we live well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Counsel, that is Councilman DelVos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| I wonder if as a point of privilege I can make a brief remark, and that is I should have probably done this during the reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| but it wasn't formally a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| I just wanted to talk to Deputy Chief and the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| There was an article in the op-ed yesterday of the Wall Street Journal talking about what has happened in Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| with the so-called Ferguson effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Their very large police department is apparently now intimidated or timid about making stops on street corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4528)|
| 1:15:38| and doing things that were ensuring sort of a safer environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| There are two sides to that coin, of course, about what's proper policing and what's improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| But they went the other way, and there's over 300 murders in that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| They have about one every two hours, and they have the strongest gun laws in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| So we're all dependent on good police enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| We appreciate you, and we hope we never get to a place where our officers are intimidated into doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| about enforcing the peace and making our communities safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| So I want to thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| But it was a scary article, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160913?start=4585)|
