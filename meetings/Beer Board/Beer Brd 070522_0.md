| 0:06:28| well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Found me. I'm just going to make a comment. I think the young lady with you was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| Previously, yes, ma'am, and we were not able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Award them a permit for some other reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| I think you would you like to discuss how you have reorganized your business so that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=403)|
| 0:06:53| Believe you might quit working there, but I understand what you're asking. Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| what's happened is my wife and I owned establishment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| after her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| owning a previous business of hers she was caught selling to a minor as a cadet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| Under those circumstances where I understood it once something that had that has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| You can't work in establishment run establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| As far as I know in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| So what has happened is now that she can't even work there. She's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| She has taken another job with a nursing staffing for a company and now it's all in my hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| and fortunately, we still have the lady to you know, Melissa was working with us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| That's where we're at with it at this point. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Do know Melissa as it happens and not a very personal way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| But I but I do and I know that she very much needs to be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Yes, so I'm very aware of her circumstances and with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| And I think she'll make you a great employee. It's difficult since the task program certification is not being completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| That's something that is just crucial to your operation without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Other incidents and I know that we have at least a couple of people on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Council who do not like to issue a permit until that has been completed. I will know I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| Let me ask you now you are operating but not selling any beer. No, ma'am. We sure and I'm sorry about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| There was a waiting list on now on Thursdays if I'm not mistaken is when they hold the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Officer Husky you want to comment on when that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| It's on Thursday, sir. Ten o'clock at the Knoxville Police Department, right? Okay, that's be definitely on it if we could still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| Do it pending or something so long. Oh, I think miss Roddy has her light on and I have a feeling what her sentiments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| But I'll let her speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Councilman Roddy, would you prefer to make a motion? Miss Pila? This is certainly in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| So that well I was going to make a motion that under the circumstances since we've had a couple of delays actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| With getting this situation straightened out that we would could make a motion to approve pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| Which is the task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| And I just really want to impress on you how important that is because I think that will give you some very good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| about how you want to organize your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Business and we have taken further steps in this store other than our old store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| We had an old-style cash register system now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| We've invested in a ruby system such as having to put dates birthdays dates as they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| And in that situation they won't approve a sale if it you push the correct date in things like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| We have taken steps to prevent anything like it's from happening and we're not a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| We are a convenience store with a setting area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| It's a country setting where we serve country food mashed potatoes green beans and things like that. We're not a bar by no means and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=592)|

| 0:10:26| I just really take a strong stand on sale to underage and that is what the task program certification addresses is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=626)|
| 0:10:35| proper carding of individuals when they come in proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=635)|

| 0:18:36| Jump in I think they're because they're changing their permit from on premise to only an off-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1116)|

| 0:19:35| Question probably had to do with the closeness of the church when it was a on-premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1175)|

| 0:24:16| Her interest in seeing that property once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| reach a reputable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Criteria, so we taught we've talked quite at length more than once and then I spoke with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| With our counsel. Mr. Swanson and spoke with Allison in regard to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| this might in any way be related to the earlier litigation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Consequently, Miss Smith was very willing to provide the documentation that Miss Everteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Commented on and that has been reviewed and to my knowledge everything looks to be quite in order and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| Miss Smith is quite aware that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Concerned about the relationship there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| but of course the property is owned and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Legally, so by a party that had been involved with Michaels and it is not her intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| She tells me and perhaps she would like to make those statements for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I think that would be a very helpful thing for you to go on record about plans there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| And just what you expect your relationship to be with. Mr. Jorgensen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| Okay, I I have been inspected by the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| So that has been turned in also all my paperwork should be complete and I know it says something about a rabies on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| But that's all he gave me and I turned it into the business office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| The second thing is he is my landlord. He is only my landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| I wasn't the only one that was buying for the lease on this property. I just happened to be the one to obtain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1550)|
| 0:26:01| Yes, mr. Chairman, let me ask you are you going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Hiring or using the same chef that you had before Stoney. Do you know him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Chris stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| At this point. No, I do not have any intention of hiring him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| If you were I was gonna say he's a good chef, but he's also my cousin. I was gonna disclose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Oh, but if you're not gonna be hiring him that he can find jobs somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| I just want to make sure if you were hiring him that disclosed it. Okay. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Think you'd be really helpful. At least if you would want to comment on your plans for training your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| Okay, we have already started that initial training the people who have come on board already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Annie Williams who is going to be my general manager has attended the task class with lieutenant Bob Waldridge at the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| Anyone who is hired whether they are already ABC certified or not will be required to go back through that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| Again and be recertified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| that's that is one of the discussions that we had and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| I didn't ask that actually Smith volunteered that she felt that that was very important under the circumstances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| I do too because I think some of the client same clientele are going to be visiting your establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| I just think they will when it reopens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| so I think it's very I feel it's very important for your staff to be fully trained and fully aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| APD's regulations in the city's expectations, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| And the gentleman who is going to head up my security is the gentleman who is a former DUI task force officer from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| Georgia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you. I was hoping you'd comment on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Any further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Councilman hopeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Miss Smith, you'd stated in this opportunity. I guess actually went on record as saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| The none of the former owners of Michaels will have any they have they obviously own the underlying real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| But they have no equity position in your business. Yes, sir. They do not. Okay, do they have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| Do they have own or control any debt instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Do you will you be borrowing any money for them? Will they have any debt position in the business? Absolutely not, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| This is a sole venture on my own and they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Yes, sir, signing for any credit or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| Okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Is this a different concept or is it a similar concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| It's similar, but it's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| We are emphasizing on the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Primarily where we will have a food special every night of the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| That that's the real difference right there, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| We are going to have a two-step process as far as making sure that underage people do not come through the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| Although we will have a doorman there from the time we open until the time we close and I will stay too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| We are going to close at 2 a.m. We are not staying open till 3 a.m| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| Alright, thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Do I understand you to say that there wouldn't be anyone under 21 allowed? Absolutely not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| And when I say that I I do say that during Christmas banquet season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Our dining room is completely closed off with two doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| And if someone underage did want to come back there for a Christmas banquet with a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| We would allow them to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| but once that party was complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| They would be escorted out the front door and we have enough security to to make that a viable option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1782)|
| 0:29:53| Any other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Ready to vote all in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Opposed. No, the ayes have it. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1799)|

| 0:31:03| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Think we have to put this one off. I think anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| who's come in and not been in for processing, this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1870)|

| 0:31:22| It has not been in for processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Miss that. Okay, the manager had not been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Processing I did not hear that. I think I was distracted. Are you the manager sir? No, I'm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Director of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| The manager has been our manager in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Going on eight nine years. He was on Beaumont and Baxter Avenue. We sold that properties over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| I'm sure that he's been through the TAM class and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| We are it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| it's our business that we're all we did was buy out the interest of Knoxville College and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| That's all we did was make sure that we applied to make sure that the you know, everything read, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| We are the previous owners and the current owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| Mr. Palmer the current manager right now. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| At this store this location, yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And he was the manager before we paid this position in a situation like this. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| Swanson, they're still required to come in for processing. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| That's my understanding of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Councilman Roddick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Councilman Becker finished. Well, I guess now I was going to go to a different subject. So go ahead. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| Guess I was just going to say with greatest apologies to everybody involved in this permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| The we've turned we've deferred many applicants in the past because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| Someone in the ownership of the management has not been in for processing and I understand this manager has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| worked for this company for a long time and is currently the manager but part of reapplying when there's a change in ownership is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| Checking all those boxes and the manager needs to come back in. That's fine for processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| So I I can't support mrs. Pillow's motion if it is still on the floor based on what mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| Swanson just said suspected to come back in I withdraw my second and I would withdraw my motion with the same apologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| But I was not aware. I was aware of the ownership situation. So I guess I did not understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2008)|
| 0:33:36| requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| councilman hopeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| No, and I understand it and it's it's really I he'd been processed before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| So I I didn't know he had to come in again. So we'll make sure that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| So you all bought out not for college's interest, that's right. We've been always the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| The operating partner in the in the agreement. Well, you all continue to use not for college students. Yes, we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| and graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Councilman Huckleston, mr. Chairman, I make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Make a motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Yeah, is there you all in a point where you can actually delay the official transfer and keep operating or is that well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| I'm I'm just gonna tell you I mean we transferred the ownership and paid off Knox College probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| Maybe even almost a year ago. They were under some financial duress and we just bought off the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| Hmm. I hope the tape wasn't working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And you've been selling beer since that time. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Guess I'm Bailey. Well, that's what where I was going with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| Is the what's the status of the current permit because I was thinking if you had a current permit you could just continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| on the active permits you have until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Get your but you don't even have a I think they had one until just a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| Ten seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| This is a joke just to be clear because sometimes my jokes miss people unlike mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Um, if all the owners were to get arrested would mark be the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| But seven days I guess didn't they to you council convened and elected you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| Did we get a second for councilman hope was the motion? Okay any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2133)|

| 0:36:13| In a situation where an ownership transfer happens, how do we find out that that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, is this one where we actually have to wait for somebody to come in and apply for a new permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| We really do. Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Don't foresee the future and I don't often know what's going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Answer would be until someone tells us otherwise and you're only doing it even in whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| You don't know you're not checking who the owner is on things. You've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Yeah on a sting or something. You're yeah, that's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Here's his enforcement yours is not a enforcement of the underage. Yours is not enforcement of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| actual administrative work, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2225)|
| 0:37:15| We have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Councilman Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Beer cannot be legally sold at this location until we have an active permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| That was a question. I just asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Swanson, so won't you ask him that question address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| You cannot sell beer unless you have a valid permit in your hand now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| I'm not sure that he understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Exactly when ownership necessarily transfers and all those kinds of issues that may be involved in this and he might do well to seek legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| Advice with respect to those issues and might do well to bring a lawyer with him when he comes on these kinds of occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Based on what he said so far and based on his own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Statement before the beer board. It sounds like they've been selling beer without a permit for about a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| And we're deferring this permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| From four weeks to the next register for me. That's what the motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| Any further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| All in favor of the deferral to for four weeks say aye aye opposed no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2309)|

| 0:38:45| Consideration given it's not really for you that we try to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| Maybe before the next council meeting which sometimes happens in the interim. I'd ask for the same consideration for the earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| Entity that was in my district that just had to come in for her testing if she's available. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| And that may be something we want to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| We've done it before but if we do need to consider for the other one we turn down for not being for processing also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2345)|

| 0:41:47| Will be in other words, I do I understand it the owner says he's not selling that's right. The buyer says he is buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Think the fire inspection was not allowed because the owner says he's not selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| And I'm you would think the owner would be in a superior position to determine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| Wouldn't you Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2529)|

| 0:42:44| Swanson if it's on the agenda and you take no action, that's effective as a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2564)|

| 0:44:52| I'm just asking for a extension. Um, we got our building permit once we started our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| We hit some snags inside the property and we had to alter our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| so we had to deal with another architect on and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| Shopping center that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| The fire marshal one just bring a few things up to code and it's part of the shopping centers issue to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| Also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Plumbing issue too. They need to bring it up to code so we can bring our part up to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| but other than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| That's all I'm asking for is a extension you have any idea of how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| We finally got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Health Department approved our plan for what we have to do now on the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| This month I went met with the gentleman up there and he approved that so we should be back on schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| probably by the end of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| That's what we're expecting. Try and be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| That's my problem. I was just gonna ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| You think another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| 30 days or 60 days. I would ask for 60 just for a buffer just in case something was to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| Yeah, I'm moved to extend for an additional 60 days second now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Your 60 days or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Or the July beer award meeting. Well because it's it was approved pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2778)|

| 0:46:37| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| And last but not least I just wanted to remind you of the of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| memo I sent regarding beer permittees that haven't paid their taxes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| Really all I want to say tonight is to see there's something else you need us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Before you can make a decision on what you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Miss Martin, what are our options? I they can the permit be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| Could it are the permits typically suspended for non-payment of licensing fees or it does this come about annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| I'm sorry that I don't recall. I remember the memo that you sent in the long list, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Well, there's two things at stake their gross receipts tax aren't paid which means they don't have current business licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| that puts them in violation of the code for the beer permit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Some of them haven't paid their annual privilege tax of $100. So there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Related issues involved but not for all of the businesses and I would that there's they we haven't typically done anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| So I would defer to the attorney for advice on on how to proceed. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| Would suggest to you that the appropriate action to take is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| someone to make a motion to refer those issues to the law department to investigate whether a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| suspension or revocation hearing should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Initiated and if it should go ahead and take appropriate action to initiate that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Typically what happens when that process gets initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070522?start=2889)|
