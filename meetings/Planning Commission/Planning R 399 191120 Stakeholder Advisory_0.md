| 0:00:30| Good morning and welcome to the second meeting of the reconstituted public stakeholder advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| I appreciate all of your willingness to volunteer and devote more time to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| especially those of you who are continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| I've stated before, but our purpose is to monitor the implementation of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=49)|
| 0:00:57| and it's now the official new zoning ordinance for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| It's no longer recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| I've retired my recode man name tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| and now I'm just working with Peter, Christina, and you and City Council, the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| and all the citizens of Knoxville to make sure the implementation of the new zoning ordinance goes as smoothly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=77)|
| 0:01:25| I think we all underestimate the amount of time that volunteers like you put into efforts like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| Once again, I want to really thank you for agreeing to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=92)|

| 0:03:39| One is that I believe I sent out to all of you, I've sent this to a lot, the link and the copy of our user's manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=219)|
| 0:03:49| If any of you want a hard copy, I have hard copies of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| I'd appreciate Amy and Jennifer working with me to schedule times for the presentation to your groups on the user's manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=232)|
| 0:04:06| I'll also be presenting to the Neighborhood Advisory Council and to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| If any of you, the rest of you, represent groups like the Home Builders or others who would like a presentation on the user's manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| please let me know and I'd be happy to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| I think this is a great tool to help the public and those who work with the ordinance on a regular basis to understand the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=259)|
| 0:04:29| and become more familiar with it and a quick, as it states, user's manual to the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| We've had, in terms of our responses to the new zoning code, we've had one, actually last evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| the City Council on second reading approved our first comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It was not a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| A piece of property that was currently zoned R2 was designated as RN4 under the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| and the new owner purchased it the day before the new code was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| He realized that RN5 would suit his needs better, so we allowed him to do the comparable zone with no application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| Both the RN4 and RN5 are comparable, and we just came down on the RN4 side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| That worked with the previous owner, but the new owner wanted RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Other than that, we're seeing more interest and actually anticipation of the new zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| as developers and property owners become more familiar with the flexibility that's built into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| the fewer number of use on review requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and the greater intensity of development in some of our commercial districts that's allowed through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| So far, the reception has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I realize change is difficult for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and the great challenge before us is managing that change and that transition to the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Again, I appreciate your help in monitoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and if you hear anything from any of your constituency groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| or any members of the general public that we can do better, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| Have we scheduled a time to do the user's manual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| Okay. I know we had that discussion, so sometimes I forget who I'm presenting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| but I always know what I'm supposed to say most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| Okay. Any other just general announcements or comments from anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| I do, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| So as you know, Brian Berry was appointed as a deputy in my department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| really to focus on the implementation of recode, and he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| That's Brian. He's actually jumping right in headfirst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| He did some reviews on the BZA applications that we've had in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| There were 64, and he evaluated them under the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| New code. New code. Zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| He found, where is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| seven of them would not have needed to go through to seek variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| They were sign-related, which represents an 11%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| I think that's what it was. Yeah, about 11%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| So it's just some, I guess, good information to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| You know, part of the point of the new zoning code was to reduce the need for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| We're seeing that it would have reduced some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| and we'll wait to see how it has an impact in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| So, Gerald, do you pass on Recode Man, the title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| No. His name is Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| As I've said throughout this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| it took a team to develop the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| It will take a team to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| This is the fifth zoning ordinance that I've played a major role in developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| and those range from resort communities to semi-rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| that have a fairly significant university that is growing quickly to very urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| And I am not a zoning expert, even after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| after practicing for almost 40 years and doing five zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| I'm not a zoning expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| I rely upon legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| the advice of people who administer the code on a day-to-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| and those who have to live with it, people like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| And it takes that team to be able to undertake an effort like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| and that team will continue to work closely with legal and with our plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| and with the public to ensure that the code is implemented and that it works well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| and that as challenges arise, that we face those challenges and deal with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| whether it's through administrative changes in how we administer the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| or through ordinance amendments and hold our feet to the fire on that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| because we tend to honor and make sure this code works to transition Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| from the 1960s form of development that our current code mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| to a more 21st century style of development that creates more opportunities for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| And with that, next item is approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| Any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=590)|
| 0:10:03| I assume you need a motion for that, right, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I think we had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| I don't see them in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| They should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| You have the same packet I do there, the second page, second and third page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| The second and third page is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=623)|
| 0:10:32| What I have here is our current state's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=632)|
| 0:10:42| Just the date's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Date's wrong, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Okay, date's wrong, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| And I don't see the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=652)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| We'll just delay that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Delay that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| I should have looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I looked at the first page and that tied on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| I was here in this room until 9.30 Monday night with County Commission, 9.30 last night with City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| so I'm not as sharp as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| And I'm older, too, than I was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| So thanks for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Well, with that, we'll delay, we'll move that agenda item to the final, near the final item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| The next is our Task 1, which was a discussion of Task 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| First of all, I'd like to know if the background reports and the information I send out is adequate for you, if that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| The first item, the nepotis, deals with parking of buses, specifically school buses, in residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=717)|
| 0:12:08| The first take in our new zoning ordinance very severely limited the parking of school buses in residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=728)|
| 0:12:17| and actually updated a number of the standards so we didn't deal with weight of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| It was more the style and the class of vehicles to make it easier for Peter's staff to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| The council had some concerns about limiting school bus parking and asked that we just incorporate the language from the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=750)|
| 0:12:40| That prohibited parking of school buses at churches and schools, and some of our churches and schools are zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| They've been non-illegal activities for the past 40-plus years and would continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| The council directed that we address this as one of the first tasks of the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| and the provision is that buses would be permitted on schools and churches subject to some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| Parking of the buses would be permitted pretty much any time, but if they're stored for longer periods of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=788)|
| 0:13:17| there would be some standards to guide the storage of buses, and that's in section 1111 of new C or B2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=797)|
| 0:13:35| or subsection B of section 1111, and it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| Church or school is located, buses may be parked or stored in accordance with the following provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| Buses shall not be parked so as to block emergency access drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| Buses shall not be parked so as to block line of sight at any drive or street intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Buses shall not be stored for more than 30 days within any required setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| Buses shall not be stored for more than, and that should be 30 days instead of three, in front of a principal building on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| And areas in which buses are stored shall be screened from adjacent residential uses with the class A buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| Can you define a class A buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| It's a 20-foot wide buffer that has a variety of planning in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| It's the same class of buffer that's required between non-residential uses and residential uses in a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| so try to make them compatible as far as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| There's not a different buffer for just a parking area than a bus storage if a new use is going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| Gerald, I've got a question for Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Does your office have a commercial scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| The 26,000 pounds gross weight, I don't think you're going to be able to determine what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| I mean, wouldn't a length of a vehicle be more important than the weight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| That language is consistent with the current code, and in all honesty, we don't deal with this much at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=904)|
| 0:15:14| and I don't think anybody's going to split hairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I think you open up a discussion that leads nowhere if we look to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=918)|
| 0:15:28| I think the key things are just trying to incorporate the fact that there are churches in residential communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=928)|
| 0:15:38| Can buses be parked on the right-of-way in front of a home, or do they have to be parked off the right-of-way and on the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=938)|
| 0:15:49| So we don't regulate the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| We regulate private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| I would imagine the answer is yes, but we've not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| And I would state that it's yes unless the street is signed for no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| This is not a change from – I mean, they didn't suddenly move churches and schools into residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| It would have been zoned differently before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| A number of churches and schools are currently zoned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| and the parking of school buses on those properties has been illegal for 40-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Have there been problems in terms of, I mean, people complaining about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| I don't think anyone's ever complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| We're making what happens legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Legal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Is that a question related to schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| So are we talking about Knox County schools and, like, their jurisdiction related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| If it's Knox County schools, they are not subject to the local jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| So this would be like a private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| There's a little church on – a Baptist church on East 5th Avenue that has a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| So it would apply to them, not only their school buses, but any church bus that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| We've tried under the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| We've set a basic threshold of five acres for the institutional zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| So there's a school or church that has a campus five acres more, it's zoned institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| but there are still churches and smaller schools, primarily churches that are zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| Some of the – again, the Baptist church on East 5th is zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| So that would be one that would be in violation of our current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| and would be in violation of the new ordinance unless this revision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1065)|
| 0:17:56| Am I ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Are you calling on me, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| I'm fairly informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| If I look at you, I'm calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| With the 26,000, what I'm concerned is subcontractors and maybe the other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| people that are HVAC repair that keep their – or plumbers that keep their work vehicle with them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| Is that within that 26,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| I'm going to answer and then I'll turn it to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Just when we developed the new provisions that were then deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| in favor of incorporating the current provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| we addressed the – we did not address – identify vehicles by their weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| We tried to modernize the way an exempted commercial, the contractors, that language was deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| If there – and I'll let Peter answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| but one option that may be is to look back at that original language or that draft language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and see what we can incorporate that would make it more in keeping with the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| Because, yeah, I do think it's really common now for folks to let their subs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| and let their employees keep that vehicle with them and then they just dispatch them from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| They typically don't have a lot where they take them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| And then the three-axle combination commercial vehicle, I guess that's the tractor without the trailer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| And why would we just, for looks, because that still, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| might be one individual that owns that cab, that that's his livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| or her livelihood that doesn't have anywhere else to park it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| Why would we not say that's not okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| I can tell you anecdotally there's a fellow that drives a truck in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| and it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| They're just huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| He parks on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| That's been in the code since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| It's not been a problem to exempt or prohibit them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| I've heard the outcry of the truck driving community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| I think a lot of times, well, I don't know what they do with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| but it's not been an issue in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Well, I think what they do with them is they park them elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| You end up with kind of lots of them parked places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| and it just, it would seem like it would actually be better to have them at individuals' homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| than have these, I mean, you go through where you see lots in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| If we're going to do away with parking lots, then you've got to put them somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| We're not doing away with parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| although when we take everyone's car, I have identified the Tesla I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| We'll keep the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| I know where the owner parks it, so when we take away everyone's car, I'm going to be there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I've got one question based on commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Are you determining that by commercial tags?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Peter enforces it, so I'll let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Because, I mean, I have letters on the truck, and I may have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Are you considering commercial tags?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Is that how you're determining what's a commercial vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| I mean, I drive a Transit Connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Is that a commercial vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I have commercial tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I have lettering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| It's not over 26,000 pounds, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| 26,000 pounds is a pretty big truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| We're talking like F-450s and bigger, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| No, way bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| We're talking like garbage trucks, semi trucks, concrete trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| things that when you turn into the driveway are tearing up the asphalt when you back in and cause a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| That's a big truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| When I say we haven't dealt with this in the five-and-a-half years that I've been with the city, we really haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| It's not been an issue that has cropped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| And so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| I'm not extremely sharp on how we would deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| We would have to dig into it and figure out what 26,000-pound vehicles look like, and we would dive into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| The way it was set up historically, if you've got an over-the-road tractor, yeah, it can't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| I think Stephanie's light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, there's a classification system for commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| So anything over 26,000 pounds is a Class VII heavy-duty commercial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| There are pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| There's all sorts of resources that I know your folks would easily find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I'm sure that we would find out exactly what those vehicles look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| And over 26,000 is pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| It's probably not something that you want in your normal residential neighborhood, so at least I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| I know Peter's already said this, but it's an issue that we haven't had to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| because we just don't receive a lot of complaints from the public about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| I guess it's on the reading of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| It's a commercial vehicle, which does not exceed 26,000 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| So anything over 26,000 pounds is automatically you can't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| So we've got a class under 26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| That's a lot of vehicles under 26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| I'm assuming it's not meant to have two of my regular little vans parked at a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| I'm assuming that's not the intent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Yeah, the intent is we don't want contractors to have their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| as the home base for all of their employees' vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| If you had a fleet of transits in the driveway, we would have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| But otherwise, the intent was to allow folks to bring their take-home vehicle back to their house within reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1453)|
| 0:24:22| so they don't have dump trucks and concrete trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Jennifer next and then Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| So, Gerald, you had mentioned maybe merging the two pieces of language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| This was from the old code, and we had some verbiage in recode that got moved back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| But if I'm hearing from Peter that we haven't really had any complaints or any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| do you have any feelings on just keeping with this, or do you think we need to merge the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| My thinking would be to just keep with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| If there are issues that arise, we've got a template we can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| some language we can look at to revise this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| But at this point, the direction from counsel was just to look at buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| and I do appreciate all the concerns, but if there have been no complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| maybe we're okay with just limiting it to addressing buses at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| And this would be for Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| A commercial vehicle which does not exceed 26,000 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| is it going to open a can of worms if we take out commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| and it's just any vehicle over 26,000 pounds so that we don't have that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| or is that going to mess up some of the other subsections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| Well, and I'll look to Peter also on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| One issue, how much does a large RV weigh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| If we take a commercial vehicle and just say anything over 26,000, we may limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Yeah, and that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Should we be expanding it to limit it by just weight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| I would be hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| I've heard a lot of people with concerns about parking their RVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| and I don't know what a weight of a large RV is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Some of them are bigger than a lot of the homes I've lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| It must weigh quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| What about when my aunt and uncle come stay in their RV in my driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| but says they can't do that in E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| That's my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| I rescind my question I just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| You'd have 30 days to correct the problem, so you'd want to get rid of them before that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| They say for three, and yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| After the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| After the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| How much is that going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| We'll work on that a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| On that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| That's my only problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Next, Joe, and then Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| The main question I had was on number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| I realize that churches and schools may have been doing this illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| Nobody's perceived that it's illegal, but they're bus parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So we've done a lot of grandfathering in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| but now we're asking a school or a church where there hasn't really been a problem to now create a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| And this may be the difference between parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| If the buses are used on a daily basis and they go out, they're parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| But if they're just kept there for 30 days without moving, and that we may want to clarify a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| I'll work with Peter to clarify, but what I wanted to prevent was just basically a bus graveyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| You can store the buses, but if you store them, at least screen them from the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| That's parsing the language and the interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Again, if you're living next to a storage yard for old buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| you may like the screen looking at it from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| If they're inoperable, then the property maintenance folks are going to flag them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| I don't think we'll have an issue with a bus graveyard, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I was just looking up at these trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| The Federal Highway Administration has classifications of these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| And kind of what you're talking about is heavy-duty vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| And there are Class 7 and then there's Class 8, which is a refuse truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| Those are huge vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| So if you need guidelines on that versus just saying commercial vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| that might be a good guideline to check out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Any other thoughts or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Regarding schools and churches, would it not make sense to just properly zone them with the new map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Going with the five-acre minimum for institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And the challenge with zoning, let's say there's a church or school that is two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| And I'm thinking, again, the one I'm most familiar with is the Baptist Church on East 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| If we zone that institutional, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| The institutional allows for fairly intense uses that may be appropriate on a five-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| or six-acre campus somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| And we don't anticipate most public schools changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| But a smaller school like that could go out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| And you have it surrounded by residential uses, a two-acre parcel that could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| for fairly intense institutional or office uses that would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| So we wanted to balance the use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| and make it as equitable with the zoning as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| but not do a zoning that could potentially impact the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| Brian, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Just so I'm clear, on the recreational vehicle hauling trailer and boat trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I assume that the boat can't be on the trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| I know that's a silly distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| But, you know, people winterize their boats and bring them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I had concerns about B4 buses not being in front of the principal building on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1820)|
| 0:30:30| My concern is churches that only have parking lots in front of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| And, again, that's the difference between storing and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Parking is okay, but storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Maybe we'll talk more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And just to let you know something, a little bit of the process for these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| the stakeholders' recommendations will be taken and result in some revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| In others, if you approve, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Then it would go to the Planning Commission as a draft ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| The Planning Commission would hold a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| There may be revisions based on public input or recommendations from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Then they would go to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| So this is the first step in a minimum three-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And at City Council, there are two readings of any ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| This is a first step in a longer process that entails a good bit of public input and public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1890)|
| 0:31:38| So just to let you know that this is not the first and only step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| It's the first of several steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Going back to the issue of parking versus storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| do we have a definition or should there be a definition that clarifies that in Section 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1913)|
| 0:32:04| I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I'm looking at it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| I should have a copy of the code here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| I don't think there's a ‑‑ I can't remember if there's a definition of storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| I'll look right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Peter's got it on his handy dandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Storage yard, but there's nothing that defines storage per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| I'll look at the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Mary, if I remember correctly, I think there is something about the parking, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| So if you go back to Article 2 in the definitions, we do specify in there parking lot pertains to operable vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1956)|
| 0:32:47| So we could probably work to craft some kind of a distinction between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Based on that definition in Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| Any other comments or questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| What I've heard so far, please add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| I'll start with the most recent to clarify the difference between storage and parking of busses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| It seemed to be okay with the bus standards if we make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| That's what I gather from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| We had some discussion about 26,000 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Can that be easily identified in terms of parking of vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| Do you clarify letting relatives come stay in their RV in your driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2019)|
| 0:33:51| This is going to sound like a joke, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| If somebody wants to have an accessory dwelling unit but does not want to construct one, they could use...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Do we have a provision for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I think that's in another...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| It's not in the zoning...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I don't think it's in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| I'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Are we talking about short-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Are we talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| No, accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| If you had a couple of students and you were renting out your vehicle to the student, your RV, and so it was stored somewhere on your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2059)|
| 0:34:36| I think ADUs say they have to have a permanent foundation, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| These would not be ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| There are a couple of provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I think there are other designs that have to be compatible with the design of the home and some other standards in the ADU standards, but somewhere in the code, I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2087)|
| 0:34:58| I don't think it is in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| There's a provision on living in a RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| There is no provision about not living in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| As far as the parking goes for this, ADUs in 10.3, let's see, Part B, 11, we do have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2110)|
| 0:35:21| Yeah, I know about the parking with ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I was just using that as a segue to the idea of people having permanent or permanent residence in a recreational vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2123)|
| 0:35:34| And whether that was legit, I assume it's not, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2134)|
| 0:36:01| We'll do more research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Any other comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| If not, we'll go on to task two, and that's the review of the hillside protection overlay language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| I provided a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I thought I'd try to give you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| I'll preface my remarks by saying that we dwell in our little bubble of this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| We understand how to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| The intent of these standards, and then taking that intent, we try to craft the standards that reasonably interpret that intent and codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2188)|
| 0:36:43| And then we administer based using the intent and then the code language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And sometimes our bubble gives us a certain perspective that those in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| Mike or Brian or Joe have wondered what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| And so one of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| The question here is, is the language in the hillside protection overlay ordinance or standards written clearly enough for you to understand from a practicing standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2223)|
| 0:37:15| I tried to give you background on how the planning staff has administered the hillside protection recommendations in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| especially with regard to review of rezoning requests and use on review where we've really used those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| Our staff has developed a slope analysis tool, and that slope analysis tool divides slopes into the hillside area into four categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2249)|
| 0:37:42| 0 to 15% for their no limitations, 15 to 25% for their limitations, 25 to 40% for their higher level limitations on both density and grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2262)|
| 0:37:54| and then 40% and more and their limitations on development become more severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2274)|
| 0:38:03| And we basically merge those to come up with an average density for a piece of property that's in a hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| And amount of land that can be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And we use those in our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So we've had planning years of experience in administering this and taking that experience, tried to craft the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2295)|
| 0:38:27| But I realize that having some knowledge in it, I may have skipped things or something in the language that could make it more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| on how it should be administered and used by the public on hillside properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| I'll start with Mary with the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I'm a little confused about what is in the task description as opposed to what is now in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2324)|
| 0:38:57| In the task description right at the end of this task, right before we'll be on page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2337)|
| 0:39:09| you say that the planning commission is not limited in the degree of type of deviations from the hillside protection standards that could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2349)|
| 0:39:21| And in the code, the new code, it says that the planning commission, following the procedure in Article 16.2.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2361)|
| 0:39:33| which is a special use review, and applying the guidelines in the Knoxville-Knox County hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2373)|
| 0:39:44| may issue a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| So what I'm not clear on is whether the guidelines, not with regard to density for nonresidential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| but in terms of disturbance, slope and disturbance, whether those would still guide the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2396)|
| 0:40:05| or whether all bets would be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| They would guide, but again, if you look at the last part of 8.9.C, it states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2407)|
| 0:40:17| in applying the planning commission following the procedure in Article 16.2.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and applying the guidelines in the Knoxville-Knox County hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| may issue a certificate application for any application for any deviation from Article 8.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| So density or land disturbance, the planning commission could issue a certificate of appropriateness for any level of deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2434)|
| 0:40:46| Well, but it's preceded by the statement, and applying the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| They would apply the guidelines, but they would look at those guidelines and say, okay, these are guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I guess it turns on what apply means then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| And also a guideline is a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| It's not a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| It's a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| And so they would look at those the same way they've done for the past 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| almost 10 years in applying the guidelines of the hillside protection plan and rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| and use some review applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And quite honestly, in the four and a half years I've been here, they've done a good job of applying those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| Sometimes it's the next level where it's a bit challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| Well, yeah, but it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| That's sort of dependent upon who's doing the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| It's human dependent as opposed to code dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| And that's already in the code, so it's a bit late to visit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Okay, but what we're talking about is the interpretation of this particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| of Article 8.9c and that particular sentence in 8.9c.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| It's crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| And I would look to Christina, but for me it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| Using those as guidelines, they can approve any deviation from the provisions of Article 8.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| which is 8.9c and line disturbance limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| And my interpretation would be that they would take seriously what those guidelines laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| and then try to deviate as little as possible from those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| That's been their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| Mary, that was the intent, was that the guidelines would be applied during that special use review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| So that was the intent, that the guidelines would be the authority that would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| to review applications for any deviations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| The big question is how determinative the guidelines would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| or whether they could be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| And given that this is special use, it doesn't go any further unless there's an appeal to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2592)|
| 0:43:20| So they make a final decision on special use reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| And so a lot rests upon what the Planning Commission decides at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| And I agree to the extent that I know, and you all would know much better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| but the few cases I've looked into, they've been pretty good at applying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| But there are a lot of hill sites in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| and the issue of applying the hillside ridgetop overlay to residential only was a big deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2629)|
| 0:43:59| during the course of the development of the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Given that, then, there clearly is a desire for no restrictions for non-residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2644)|
| 0:44:16| And there will be pressure in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I think that's something that the Planning Staff and the Planning Commission are well accustomed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| and their recommendations are based on the good for the overall community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| and trying to balance the benefits of a certain development with the benefits to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2671)|
| 0:44:43| We work to balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And I can give an example, a very real example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| where the Planning Commission allowed a slight deviation from the land disturbance guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| or recommendations in the Hillside Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| resulting in a good project that met community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| and benefits the community overall with minimal disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| but that flexibility is needed because if we have hard lines everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| then we limit the opportunities for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| I think I could sum up my opinion by quoting the phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| trust in Allah, but tie your camel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| I'm trying to remember who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I can't remember, so maybe I'll go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Brian, Amy, or Jennifer, and then Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I'll be really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Your question was, is this language practical and clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And have you all discussed this with civil engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| and have they reviewed it, and what do they think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| So far, I haven't heard any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| And then you were talking about you all have some slope analysis tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Is that something that the civil engineering community, do they have those same tools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| That's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| We can make it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Often we work with the engineers, the developers, design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| in assessing the hillside, and we provide our slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| and so far no one's, I don't think anyone has ever challenged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| They don't challenge the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| They may sometimes say we need more density than the slope analysis recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| but they don't challenge the tool that was used to develop that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| And Jennifer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I think there was conversation about tweaking the map a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| where the hillside overlay actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| Am I completely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Is that something that's still in process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| I'd say the map, we looked at it, and it's very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| I think how we tweaked it with the exceptions in Section B with the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| doesn't apply to legally existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| Lots of record for single-family dwellings where the lot is one acre or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| lots that have been issued a grading permit, lots that have been previously disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| and provided that the disturbance is not, amount of disturbance is not increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Instead of tweaking the map, which 15, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| everything we looked at when we tried to do it, if it's 15% slope, it's 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| We're exempt of existing development and legally existing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| single-family lots in areas that have been previously disturbed or graded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| so we used that approach to adjust the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Just two other quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| These lots, you know, where the redevelopment and infill is going to be on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| you know, the very severe slopes, that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| I hear from a lot of different people, like, that's what we have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We have the very difficult properties left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Like, the easy development has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| The medium and difficult has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| We have unique and difficult slopes to be developed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| and so we do need that, you know, human interaction, that flexibility, that guidance from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| This is guidance, and so I would put that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| I mean, if it's just going to be a black and white, this is what you get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| then we don't need MPC's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I'm going to call it MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| So I do like having that flexibility in there for what we have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| and where we're going to see that redevelopment infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| The last question, I guess, is more in Christina's lane, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| In B1 and in B4, you say legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Does legally mean grandfathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| And legally, like, if I own something, but maybe it was legally done 40 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| is that – are you guys cool with that ambiguity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| or trying to figure out what legally means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| So we actually, in the recode process when this was in front of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| and council would make changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| we actually cleaned up this section to remove some of that confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| So, you know, the legally existing prior nonconformities, that's always such a mouthful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| but those would still be governed by Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| So here, what we wanted to specifically clarify, I think, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| was tied in with number three where there was some kind of a grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| and work had started but not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| And then we'll go to John and then to Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| The other question I had in your standard application kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| it says density and land disturbance limitations will be determined based on the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| And I was wondering if it shouldn't be – you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| the issues are protecting the views in stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| So there's – I don't know that all – do we have all views created equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| So I'm thinking like 275, you know, when you go up central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| there's this industrial park that's wedged in there between 75 and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| It's – who knows what's going on back there, what's been disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| what's illegally disturbed, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| That's a great redevelopment, industrial redevelopment opportunity in the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| So it seems like the question would be what if it's already been disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| what does it matter if we redevelop it into something useful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| Whether it's legally disturbed or not disturbed, it's still been disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| We don't know what's going on back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| But to redevelop it into something useful then would the fact that it might be a brownfield site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| it's looking at the interstate, it's across the street from a bunch of towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| there should – seems to me there should be other criteria besides just the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| that would go into that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And I'd hate to see this preclude those kind of analysis, just the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| However, the hillside – I'm not at this point ready to tackle the hillside protection plan again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| But we have the option of going to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| That's what going to the planning commission provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| that option where instead of just looking at the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| the planning commission through that special use process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and this is going back to what Mary brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| can look at the overall development and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| here's where the benefits to the community may outweigh the additional disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3147)|
| 0:52:35| of what appears to be a previously disturbed slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| or the redevelopment of this site in order to do it appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| would require some minimal disturbance of a virgin slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| But the benefits to the community outweigh that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Do you think staff would still have that flexibility, would maintain that flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Not staff, but the planning commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| And, again, staff, the real-world example I told Mary I could cite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| that was where we staffed, looked at it, worked with the developer and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| okay, disturbing this amount of the existing slope would enable this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| that benefits the community, and staff recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| and the planning commission approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| You'd still have the ability to recommend to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and be flexible on a site like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| And that doesn't mean I agree that we can't always be black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| The world is not black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| We need that flexibility, and it is a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| If something goes to the planning commission for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| it would be noticed and signed on the property postcards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| to the surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| So there would be a public process and public involvement in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| I'm going to go this way and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Sir John, Pat, and then you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| That's a good segue into what I was going to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| The properties that I see that are of concern are the ones that are in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| which we have to go through the D1 process to get a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| to do any project downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| And if we do the Hilltop Protection Agency or HPP plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| we would have to go to the planning commission as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| to get a different certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| But most of those are previously disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Well, let's use the city-owned property on Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| between the Standard and West Jackson workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| That's going to go up for RFP pretty soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| and we want the highest and best use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| The city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Right now it's got an HPP on top of it, even on the flat part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| So I understand it's got a slope behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| How do we deal with the downtown properties in a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Because I'm a huge hilltop hugger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| It's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| It's the ones that are downtown that are specific to our density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| that we want to encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And downtown is meant to be dense and kind of infill to its fullest potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| with zero property lines and things like that that the zoning code allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| So I'm wondering if there's a way to merge the HPP with maybe the D1 process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| in downtown only so that we don't have to have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| I mean, that's going to be a pretty robust process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| I think I was going to suggest that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| That's something we can look at to merge just for the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Also, I think my interpretation is that most of those have been previously disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| And even the site there you mentioned, that flat area wasn't made by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| That's a previously disturbed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| There are some other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| I think most of them would be exempt in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| and we'll come up with some language and try to have it for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| by the next meeting, merging the D1 and the HP and the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| Yeah, and I think what Jennifer was alluding to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| there was a discussion about removing it from downtown and then putting it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| And I think to get to this point in our discussion, which, again, I kind of championed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| and I said I'll kind of put down the argument and get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| But the downtown properties, again, when you start to look at the ones with the HPP on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| are some of our undeveloped sites that should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| So, again, I think there's that 15% tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| I would challenge it based on some of the properties that I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| And I own one of them, so I'm pretty familiar how flat it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| And it doesn't have a 15% slope on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| So I'm just wondering how that boundary got placed on it in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| So I do think if mine personal one had that overlay put on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3408)|
| 0:56:56| and I'm confident it's not 15% where it's shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| then others potentially could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| So I do think there's some rigor that needs to be applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| at least in the dense areas that we have and want to encourage to be more dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| And we'll look at that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| And my understanding is that that initial map was created as part of the hillside protection overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| But what that map does is fairly generally identify what may be hillside areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| and then the next step is the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| We found properties within what overall hillside that may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| this area may be a hillside under the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| but this little lot within that, when we do that initial slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| we find that it's less than 15% so you're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| It's basically trying to look at the entire county and apply a map to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3465)|
| 0:57:54| because that's what it was done, the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| but that is just a sign that on each individual property there's a slope analysis needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| and that some may, within that 15% overall, there may be some with a 45%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| and some that are perfectly flat and we just need to do that initial review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| So it doesn't mean necessarily that these standards are applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| It just means that first step of the slope analysis is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| But we will look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| and we'll have a proposed ordinance amendment at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| to merge the HP special review with the downtown or the design review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| Gerald, I'm not seeing anything here that mentions anything about aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| or ecological issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Is that a consideration when the planning commission is going to review these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| And also, have we looked at anything in terms of identifying elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| that we want to avoid and not disturb those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| And lower elevations we can come in and level it and make it developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| The aesthetics and the ecological, even though they're not stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| those are things that the planning commission could look at as part of their special review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| balancing those with the density limitations and the extent of slope disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| Again, identifying those lower elevations and the higher elevations may be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| I'd look to, I'm going to toss this to a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| and say that may be a direction from city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| or the city administration or whoever considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| does the, or even the planning commission could direct staff to look again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| at the hillside protection plan and give me plenty of warnings so I can buy lottery tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3583)|
| 0:59:52| But, you know, that takes a lot of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I think of a place where I worked previously that there was an elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| and it was probably more distinct in the elevations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| There was an elevation above which the hillside protection there was slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| just the slope protection standards applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| And below that elevation they didn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| And basically the downtown is in a bowl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| and so it enabled development and activity downtown even on slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| But once you got up on the ridges it severely restricted development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| In fact, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| It's something we could certainly look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I think it would be more challenging here because we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| Knoxville is not just a bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| It's got ups and downs all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| It's identifying areas, lower elevations that would not be subject to the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| and higher elevations that would be an interesting undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| I think Pat made a very important point when he brought up the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| of considering aesthetic and ecological and especially elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| One of the things that concerns me, I mean, I think downtown is downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| so it's pretty much built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| But other areas are in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Those are the areas especially where the more the transition occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| the less likely it is that the hillside protection overlay will be adhered to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| in terms of considerations like ecology and aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| So I allow we address this other than just hoping that those involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3702)|
| 1:01:51| will be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| I heard your comment, and I heard Pat's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| I'm thinking through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Let me finish the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| It may be that somewhere in Section C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3728)|
| 1:02:18| in that sentence where the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| I'm applying the guidelines A is certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| maybe the Planning Commission should consider all aspects of slope disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| including ecological and aesthetic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Gerald, can you talk into the microphone, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I was trying to think and not sure myself, so I didn't want too many people to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| In that last sentence, applying the guidelines in the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| Hillside and Ridge Top Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| the Planning Commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Another sentence, the Planning Commission should consider all implications of slope disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| including ecological and aesthetic, stormwater, whatever, and just clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| I think those are in the full hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| The 81 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| We'll cross-reference them for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Let me go to, I think, to Chris next, and then back to Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| The slope analysis is to see if I understand this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| If a particular parcel had 10 acres of flatland and 3 acres of 40% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| it would be a weighted average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| It would be a weighted average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| If the weighted average was below 15%, they could wipe out the 3-acre slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Within each of those four categories of slope, 0 to 15, 15 to 25, 25 to 40, and 40 and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3831)|
| 1:04:02| we look at the acreage or the square footage in each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| and then if your density for your entire, let's say you have, just to make it easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| 10 acres is 4 units an acre, so you have 40 units on the base, but 10 acres is 0 to 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3854)|
| 1:04:24| so on that 5 acres is 0 to 15, so on that 5 acres you get 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3864)|
| 1:04:33| Just to make it easy, 5 acres is 15 to 25, and I think, I'm trying to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| density is cut by half that, so on that 5 acres you get, it's 2 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| so on that 5 acres you get 10 units, so your entire density for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| instead of 40 units on that 10-acre property is 30 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| And then we would say, okay, also you have to limit the disturbance of your slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| so the maximum you can disturb that 5 acres of the steeper slope is 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| so you have to preserve 50% of your steeper slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Okay, so the grading, it's applied individually to the slope, the percentage slope in each parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3917)|
| 1:05:26| so over 40% if you have more than 40, you could still disturb that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| but it's a weighted average over the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| It's a weighted average over the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| So they could take out the 3 acres then, like, if it's a weighted average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| I'm just thinking, like, the flatland will dilute the hilly land, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| And that's part of the plan review is working with you to reduce the disturbance of that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Gerald, what if we just decided give them the same density if they stayed off the slope altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| And that's one thing that I've been an advocate for that we're looking at through the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| is reviewing our plan residential standards, and then we'll work those into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| Actually, my thinking is we actually give a density bonus if you stay off the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| That's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| I think that would be a very viable way of doing it, and we're working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| And that will come back later to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| I was thinking back to John's example of his property where clearly there's some space that's been designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| as being in the hilltop protection overlay, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| If you want to correct the map, how does that process work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| Through the slope analysis or come in with your concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| and we'll look more closely at the topo on the property and address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| And once you do that, does it get re-uploaded to KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| so you don't have the green stamp of you can't do anything on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| I think if you look at your property and you're less than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| then you might be in the overlay, but it has no effect on your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| I think it's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| It's marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| From his perspective, he might try to be selling something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| and that's going to be something that lessens the value potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| And we'll continue to look and tweak that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| We'll look at adding to 89C some direction with regard to issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4069)|
| 1:08:01| that should be considered by the Planning Commission and deviating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| I think we'll continue to look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| and the mapping of the hillside protection overlay to tweak that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| working with our GIS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| You'll have to remind me if there were other major points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| but I think those were the two directions we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| What I encourage you to keep as you work with steeper slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| or have clients or neighbors with questions, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Don't wait for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Send me an email or give me a call, and we can address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| And to give you more input on what I mentioned to Pat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| our planned residential zone in the county is older and sometimes challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| We're looking at how to tweak that to make it more less ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| and also provide some incentives for doing what we think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| One of those I talk with staff about is how do we provide a carrot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| for not disturbing steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| We've all, the county has taken, or we've taken a more stick approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| that you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Well, what are the rewards for doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| In the community, I talked about where we had steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| We tweaked their ordinance some time ago to give you a density for staying off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| a bonus for staying off the steep slopes, so we'll look at that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| As we work on it in the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| our planned residential district will bring those provisions before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| and see if they're appropriate to put in our hillside protection overlay in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| and, again, take a carrot approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I think that works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| When I was a kid, I'd always do things more willingly for a big piece of chocolate cake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| than I would to avoid getting a whipping because after a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| if I got so callous, the whipping would hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| So any comments, any follow-up, any questions, general questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| or comments from the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Our next meeting is January 22nd in this room at 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| Here are the minutes, the real minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| I'd like to make an approval in front of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| And I'll read the minutes the next time before I come to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| I read these some months ago and they looked actually in the notes right after our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| because Dory did a great job of preparing them, but I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4242)|
| 1:10:58| I'll give you a minute or two to look over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4258)|
| 1:11:28| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4288)|
| 1:11:38| Do you need one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| There's a distinction between the italicized language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| So the italicized is what we decided, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| No, the italicized puts in standard print on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4319)|
| 1:12:09| That's on page three of the meeting, minutes of review and discussion of the identified task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| The standard text is the task and the italicized is some discussion, primarily my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| There's a motion and a second to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Next meeting, January 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Does anybody want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| I just wanted to ask a couple follow-ups from what I said at the last meeting in the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| I haven't seen a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| The one was I asked for how members of the public can contact the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| We have contact information, and I asked whether that could either be made available to us online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| or whether there be a mechanism for just contacting, sending stuff to Gerald directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| and you would forward comments before the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| You could send them, and we'll also on our website put a contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| That's a way to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| On the web page or the site for the stakeholders, we'll have a way to contact, an email contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4414)|
| 1:13:43| An email for each one or to you directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| To the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| They'll likely come to me, and then I'll disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| We'll work that out, but there will be a way to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| There ought to just be some process if we want to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| I agree, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| The second thing was I don't think that the video from the last meeting is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| The minutes were, but I didn't see a link to the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I've seen the video, but it wasn't because of being online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4447)|
| 1:14:16| I want to thank CTV for taping these and makes it available to all the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| If you'd like to relive this, you can watch CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| We'll make sure there's a link to the video on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| And for this meeting as well, we'll get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I can just tell you from in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| it's very hard to hear when people are not speaking into the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| so that's why I want you all to watch it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Actually, having lived through these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| the last thing I want to do is watch any of them, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| But I do appreciate your involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Have a great Thanksgiving, and traveling safe travels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191120stakeholderadvisory?start=4500)|
