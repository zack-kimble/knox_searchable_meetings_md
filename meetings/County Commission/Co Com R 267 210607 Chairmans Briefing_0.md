| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=0)|
| 0:00:31| I don't have a gavel, so I just want to welcome everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| It's 3.02, and I appreciate all those who are in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| There are at least one other commissioner on their way, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| but apparently there's a big wreck on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| so we will do our best to catch up and then provide information to anybody who's not able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| I also want to welcome everybody that's here from the public or from other departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| that's interested in learning about our world of plans and plans and more plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| And today is the fourth chairman's briefing of this legislative calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| and these are informational sessions for the commissioners and for the teams in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| to help us better understand things that really take a deep dive of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| So a lot of times we get 10-minute presentations before work sessions or commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| and it's just not enough time to really dig into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| So these sessions actually were created by Commissioner Smith when he was chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| to really sort of give bigger blocks of time to tackle big issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| and to find out how to sort of digest it all because it's a whole lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| So all the presentations that will be given today will be provided to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| and then anybody else who wants it, just see me before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| and I'll make sure you get a copy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| The next chairman's briefing will be Monday, August 9th at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| and we'll send out information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| It will be all about emergency services and our 911 system and our dispatch in emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| So I'll send out more information on that coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| So with that, I want to welcome two of our teams today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| We have teams from engineering and public works and our teams from the planning department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| and we want to welcome them, turn over the presentation, and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| So Amy Brooks, welcome to the chairman's briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Great. Thank you, Commissioner Jay, for inviting us to present today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| and to participate in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I'm Amy Brooks. I'm the executive director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| With me today I also have Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| She's our senior planner, and she's done a lot of work in long-range planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| as well as Jeff Welch, who I'll introduce here in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| So over the years, as you can see, many plans have been developed for all parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| This afternoon we're going to have a discussion on how and why we plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| to discuss the opportunity this county has to develop a new comprehensive inline use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| that will guide growth over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| If anybody's interested, I did bring a whole bunch of plans that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| They're over here on the table if you want to peruse them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| and they're also available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| So Public Chapter 1101, called the Growth Policy Act, which some of you are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| requires all Tennessee counties and their associated municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| to develop countywide growth plans except counties with metropolitan governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| So the plans establish urban growth boundaries for municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| They also establish planned growth areas as well as rural areas outside of those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| Once adopted, the growth plans, which are based on 20-year growth projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| do not expire but may be revised following the same process that created them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| Our growth policy plan was adopted in 2000, July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and is used to guide monthly recommendations of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| And as you all know, new growth pressures have challenged the requirements of the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| in recent years, especially in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| I'm not going to read everything on this slide, but it's really important to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| that Tennessee Code Annotated Title 13 is enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| This grant of power in the process for adoption of a zoning ordinance is found in Title 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| The power to zone, as with the power to plan, in general is not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| So local governments are required only to have a growth plan and a solid waste plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| Communities can decline this grant of power and not adopt zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| However, if a community like Knox County does have zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| then the community must follow the processes and procedures in Title 13 and create and maintain a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| I have pulled out several relevant sections from the Tennessee Code that relate to zoning and land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| and I'd be happy to take a deeper dive into these sections in our own regulations sometime in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| especially as related to subdivisions, plats, as well as our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| The Knox County Code of Ordinance authorizes planning in the county to adopt a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| after the development of a comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| The purpose of the zoning code, of course, is to guide the physical development of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| outside of the municipal boundaries of Farragut and the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| both of which have their own zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| So several departments of the city and the county work closely together with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| like I just got a lot louder here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| to help plan and administer zoning ordinances and the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| The city and county have their own building codes and engineering departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| Each jurisdiction has their own specific rules, as I mentioned, that guide development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| On the county side, we work daily on a daily basis with engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| to help answer questions related to the zoning code and our monthly development review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| including the review of transportation impacts for certain types of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| This slide is intended to describe the relationship of all of our adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| I'm going to spend a little time on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| So the growth plan, as I mentioned, is mandated by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| and identifies all land in the county as urban planned growth or rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| The growth policy plan guides where and how development occurs in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| The general plan, which was adopted in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| and lays out the long-range vision and policy framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| for the physical economic development for the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And while the general plan presents this broad, long-range principles, concepts, and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| a series of more specialized plans that you'll see there on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| provide specific guidance for plan implementation and community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| and capital improvement programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| The sector plans are the most commonly referenced by the planning commissioners and planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| There are 12 sector plans, and they are considered components of that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| These 15-year sector plans are focused on land use and capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| They can be amended along with the general plan with these other smaller area plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| if they are adopted by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| Just for clarification, what are the timelines that the growth plan, the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| and the sector plans must be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Are they on a schedule or as needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| I know each one maybe is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| They are not on a specific schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| The growth policy plan was intended to be re-evaluated every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| But it hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| It has not been, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| And there is no mandate necessarily to update the 30-year general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| Obviously, you want to do it before the 30 years expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| And the sector plans generally reference a six-year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| So all updates to the sector plans or other plans identified in the 2033 general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| are incorporated when they're adopted back into that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| And planning staff, I'm just going to put a little plug for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| It's not on the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| But planning staff has recently created something called Panorama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| It's a dashboard that includes interactive data and maps on population demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| economic conditions, quality of life, housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| a number of other pieces of information that are included in our sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| in the front and our background report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| This is the intent of this to keep it updated on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| So as data becomes available, we just immediately update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| That can be found on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Although the Hillside and Ridgetop plan was not adopted by Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| it is used on a monthly basis to inform rezoning requests and development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| It is advisory in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| But as new codes and programs are developed, it's a great resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And there's a number of great ideas related to incentives for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| model conservation, subdivision ordinances, best management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| that I think could really be a great resource as we think about updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| or creating a new land use and transportation plan for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| So, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| The county commission did not adopt it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Do you remember when that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| What was the date of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Liz, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Liz was heavily involved in managing that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| I believe it was 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| I don't have it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Okay, so here are a few recent examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| I just pulled out three of more of our specialized plans that have been undertaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| specifically in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| So the East County Community Plan was adopted by the county commission on September 14, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| This was a plan that was developed to really focus in on East County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| to help them identify some specific tools that could be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| to help preserve and enhance the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| So following on the heels of the 2016 Northwest County Sector Plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan was undertaken in order to take a closer look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| at transportation implications of land use decisions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| and provide recommendations for future investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| or areas to be looked at closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| This study had over 500 participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| and just a wide range of contact in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| There were three core recommendations that were pulled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| that included evaluating short-term traffic and safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| the feasibility of improvements in North Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| and pedestrian crossings along Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| The Hardin Valley Mobility Study was not adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| but is intended to inform future transportation investments in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| It's a great resource as we prepare the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| for the new Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| What's the general shelf life of a study like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Is this something that will guide things for usually five years or ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| Or does it depend on the – we have so many studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| and sometimes they collect a lot of dust and sometimes they're used very frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| A lot of times the recommendations will stay relevant for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| and sometimes the timing is just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| For example, the Hillside and Ridgetop Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| although it wasn't adopted by county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| it was adopted as part of the new zoning code for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| and so now they use it to help evaluate developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| that are located in the Hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So that was a number – you said 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| So just adopted in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| So you said this was not adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| But it was brought before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I'm sorry, it's before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| It was presented before the county commission, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And they chose not to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| It was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| There was a language change that made it advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| And just quickly before you move on to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| there's a lot of information here for those who are joining us from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| I know there's a ton of information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I know we're going quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| and we're going to try to do our best to sort of digest it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| These sessions are education sessions really for the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| but this is a hot-button issue and a lot of stuff that people ask about all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| and this is probably the hardest thing we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| We're going to have some more time to have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| If you all have a question in the audience, we don't usually do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| but Mandy, if you'll raise your hand, if you all have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| and you can figure out a way to write it down and give it to Mandy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| then I'll do my best to kind of curate it and sort of ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| I won't necessarily get to every question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| and if it's something that's just going to ignite a whole bunch of further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| discussion that we can't get into today, I may sort of put it to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| but I did want to sort of offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| So if you do have something that pertains to what we're talking about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| you want to ask, then just give it to Mandy, and we'll pass notes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| So sorry for the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| No, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| And I will say that planning staff, and I'm sure that Jim's staff as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| we'd be happy to take a deeper dive into any of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We're happy to come out to a community and present specifically on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| if a plan has been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| and some community group wants more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| we're happy to go out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| We're happy to have phone conversations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| Okay, I talked about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| So the John Sevier Highway Scenic Corridor Study was initiated by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Daley and adopted by a county commission in October of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| This is the first step in a two-step planning effort to develop policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| and create tools for managing development in a way that encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| and projects this corridor, especially the rural character of that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| I had thought we were going to do a Western Avenue corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Where are you guys with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| It is on our work program, and it's something that we are teeing up to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| I have to admit that over the past year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| just based on a number of different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I don't know that starting a big effort last year would have been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| advantageous, but we've just been very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| But it is definitely on our work program and is teed up to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| We also have Alcoa Highway that was also requested by county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| and city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| and the city council also requested a Western Avenue study to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| So those are in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| So now I'm going to show you a short video that discusses how planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=863)|

| 0:14:36| Planning is complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=876)|

| 0:15:38| Zoning is important because it tells you what can legally happen on a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=938)|

| 0:17:55| review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1075)|

| 0:18:05| Amy, could you quickly talk at this point, one of the questions we often get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| from constituents is why does the use come after zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| You know, the order in which things come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| This is a common thing that always comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Why are we approving the zoning before we know what's going to be on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| And I know you have a great flow chart on your website about, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| processes and step by step by step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| But that's sort of the common theme that always comes up when you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| with something obviously very contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Can you help explain that just a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| It's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| So there are a number of uses that are permitted by what we call by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| that are listed under each individual zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| And we have to, when we're looking at a request to rezone the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| we look at all the potential, like what could happen in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| And so that's the way our code is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| That's the way our ordinance is set up is to look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| And then there is a list in most of the zones of uses that are permitted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| So these uses may or may not be appropriate in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| and they require additional level of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| A lot of times where this question that you just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Commissioner Drake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| is when we're talking about planned residential zones or planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| because all development requires use on review in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| So someone might request to do a planned residential rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and you're just looking at the density that they're requesting and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| necessarily the plan at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Again, that's just how our code is currently set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Does that help clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| There's a lot to the development process and how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| And I guess from a gross standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| people need to know what is allowable before they spend serious money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| what exactly will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I know it seems somewhat backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| but we see it a lot in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| And a lot of it, the PR for residential is for public input site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| and engineering public works and planning to screw down deeper into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| details of how that four units an acre is going to lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| But there are a lot of, as Amy was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| a lot of zonings that have permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| And then there are also allowable uses under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| And we don't ever see those on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| but what percentage of yours breaks down like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| It's typically planned commercial or PR residential that you all review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| For use on review. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| That's predominantly what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I mean, there are some other ones that come forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I mean, if you don't zone your property PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| if you just go residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| it wouldn't necessarily come back for a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| No, unless it was a large, if it's a large subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| it would come back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So over a certain number of lots, we would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| The planning commission would. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| But I think essentially we have this just so there's more insight and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| public input and more review by both the professional engineers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| professional planning staff before development breaks ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| And I would say too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| back to what comes first for a lot of the members that are in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| And this is where planning can really come and do a presentation for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| HOA group or your neighborhood group or any other constituency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| really understanding the step-by-step process of what comes first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| what comes second. You know, if this happens, it goes this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| And that way they do a really excellent presentation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| And a lot of that is helping people understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| If you see a bulldozer show up one morning, you're likely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| six months behind the decision-making process. If you see a sign go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| understanding where you are in the process is half of the of the battle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| sort of understanding land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| So please take them up on that offer to, to, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| I probably emailed those two documents about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| rezoning and the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| and the flow chart of how things happen more than any other document for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| constituents. So it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| So this kind of just follows up with what commissioner day was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| We have a lot of resources on our website. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| please take a look at that, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| feel free to reach out to any of us, all of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| all the plans can be found on the website, but we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| we're happy to talk to you or come out to a meeting or send you additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| resources. So now I'm going to turn the presentation over to Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| He's our planning's transportation manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| He's also the director of the transportation planning organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| He's going to discuss another layer of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| which is regional transportation planning. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you, Amy. I asked for 30 slides. I get three slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| So you're going to hear me talking an awful lot instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| but another aspect that the planning staff oversees is our regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| transportation planning efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| And commissioner Smith and commissioner Jay are very intimately aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| because they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| have served on that board and commissioner Jay currently serves on our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| but that is a regional transportation planning organization mandated by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| federal government to address transportation issues from an urbanized area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| Sort of like living in our pandemic, we sort of enclosed ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| but we can't live that well, that long, very well, very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| And even for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| you have to look broader issues and economic you have to look broader issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| And that's the role of the TPO is to address regional transportation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| As you see on the slide, here's our, our partners that are involved with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| include Maribel, Alcoa, Farragut, Lenore city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Loudoun, Blount County, Anderson County, Clinton, Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| state of Tennessee, East Tennessee development district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| our partners in that TPO process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| Whoops. How'd that happen? Click the wrong button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| That's a different presentation. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| That's my, that's my laptop. I'm sorry. Oh, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| There's probably more than a few star Wars fans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Even some Mandalorian fans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| So a couple of our aspects that we have to do for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| as required by our federal regulations is to look out 20 to 25 years of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| our region is going to grow, how much it's going to grow from employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| residential, economic, land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| That's why there's such a strong linkage to how a community has a land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| dictates where your growth is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| where your growth is going to be dictates where your transportation and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| traffic's going to be. If you don't know where your land use is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| you don't know how you're going to build your infrastructure to accommodate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| land use. And I'll just sidebar that goes with schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| sewers and waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| That's why there's good reason to have a good trans a good general plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| then link to that, to a transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Our long range plan, that's the mobility plan, 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| That's our vision for the region for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| We have about four and a half to $5 billion of investment that is programmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| over the next 20 to 25 years, including TDOT and local and regional dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| From there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| the next major aspect is called the transportation improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| That sort of implements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| that's your capital improvement program for the region where and which projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| and what funding sources and what is the timeline that a project will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| implemented. And that is updated on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| but on a primary it's revisited every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| I believe earlier this year, Commissioner and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| this board had a presentation from TDOT on their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| all their projects and they develop a three year plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| every year and that helps feed into our process too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| And then all the jurisdictions have some sort of a comprehensive or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| transportation plan, just as Knox County has a lot of plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| transportation plans that feed into the process and then help inform and feed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| into the mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| My last slide just tells you why we're looking at this from a regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| perspective. You look at the graphic here before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| the little dots represent the dark dots with the dark circles runs commuting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| from Knox County to the other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| The gray docks are commuting to Knox County and then the white docks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| the clear docks will work outside our TPO area and then live in other parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| the County. Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| When you look at the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| there's approximately 70,800 folks that live in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| but work outside of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| about 35% of our population live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| but work outside of Knox County. That's a huge number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| It's bigger than I thought it would bend. So that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| these are just estimates from the census Bureau, but you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| it's a statistic that they process. They, they're pretty good at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| about 136,000 live and work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| So there's about 207,000 folks that are employed within here that are in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| County. Those that commute to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| there's approximately 60,000 that commute to Knox County on a daily basis from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| these regional counties that basically touch us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| So as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| there's a tremendous amount of interaction between our counties traffic wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| again, and transportation and economic development. Denzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| almost 50% of the people in Denzel and Blount County live in Knox County at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| work at Denzel. So there's a lot of interaction there. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| about 18,500 people in Blount County commute to Knox County on a regular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Knox County sends about 15,700 folks to Anderson County on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| commuting. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| that's why we really need to have some good planning and the interaction and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| look at things from a regional perspective. So two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| This one area that works outside the TPO area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| So you're saying 31,000 people live in Knox County but don't live anywhere in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| this region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| That do not work in adjacent counties. They may work down in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| They may work in Athens. They may work over in Morristown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Hamlin County, places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| Their work address might be Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| but they may be housed here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| So it's a little bit misleading number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| There are still a number that commute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And this doesn't take into account working from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| somebody that may work for a company in St. Louis, but work out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Some of that would be covered in that number. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Knox County is literally at the crossroads of the country with the two major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| interstate systems. When you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| is there a way to look at our commuting patterns and our regional footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and compare it to anywhere else and say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| is there a benchmark to better understand? Is this the norm? Is this high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Is this low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Yeah, that's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We'd have to really want to compare geographic size because you wouldn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| to compare yourself to a DC where the commuting patterns are two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| two and a half hours or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| But I would say because of a good regional transportation system and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| are, can commute further away out and for by choice that they live to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| choose to live 40 miles away and they can make it into downtown Knoxville in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| one hour and they choose to do so. There's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| that's just folks choose to do that. I think our transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| particularly our interstate system that we have, and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| there has provided excellent access to our regional counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| What was that number again? The number of people that commute from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| to other counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| All total approximately 70,000. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| And that includes that, you know, 30 some thousand that live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| you know, not the adjacent county. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| okay. I think I'll be turning over Mr. Snowden right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| Thank you, Jeff. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| How do you advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| Oh, okay. Good deal. Two places. I'm more, I'm going to start with the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Jim, my name's Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I'm the engineering director for Knox County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| The, as Jeff mentioned previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| one of the things that we do is that you guys just recently approved as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| the capital budget. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| the county approves a capital roadway budget and I wanted to just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| address how we prioritize and I guess to establish those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| And on the screen here you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| essentially we started in 1995 and we had a very simple matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Essentially it was road width versus traffic volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| just as simple as it got, just an X and Y axis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| And we evolved over time a little bit. And as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| in 1995 we identified the ball camp park corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| dry gap park and Dutchtown road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| So you can see that some of those things have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Some are still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| So this process does take a little bit of time and I'll get into that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| bit later. And then in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| we actually expanded upon that and looked closer in and looked at minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| collectors. And then in 2000 we added growth rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| So then we started thinking about, okay, traffic is growing in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| We need to include that. So each time we add a different phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| we want to try to make this model a little more nimble to accommodate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| growth. The next thing we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| and this lasted a long time for almost 10 years was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| was the fix it model that looked at primarily intersection safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| And you'll notice like the improvements at Ebenezer at Gleason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| they're at the Sunoco, the Gallagher View in Gleason at the Breadbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Those are projects that originated out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| that we saw high crash rates and implemented capital projects accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| What we've been doing and really has just done great things is we kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| accumulate that. We looked at crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| We looked at severity of those crashes as well as the roadway width and gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I hate to say bonus points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| but added had a scoring matrix for those top projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| And what you see with that is this next slide kind of up at the very top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| you will see a kind of a detail view that kind of captures all that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| the crashes, the severity, the volume, and the roadway width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| And then to the bottom left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| you can see kind of a summary of projects that we identified that were the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| 10, so to speak. And if you'll notice, I've noted on the screen, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| how these vary per district. Obviously the first one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| Schaefer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| it's intersection with Hardin at the off-ramp of Hardin Valley was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| That project was completed in 2018 and has eliminated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| Now TDOT's coming in and doing a project to redo the intersection or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| interchange. And you can see as we go down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker's project, Canton Hall was number two on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| That one is a total reconstruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| horizontal and vertical alignment, adding pedestrian facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| We've hit some snags with permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| but that just hopefully goes to show you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| these are the ways in which we identify projects and then secure the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| and then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| And the next slide is essentially just a kind of a timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| A lot of people ask about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| why sometimes a road project takes so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I know sometimes I get frustrated with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Obviously once you identify the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| you have to do a preliminary engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| You have to look at, I guess, the 30,000 foot view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| the problems that you're going to run into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| whether it be utilities, environmental permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And thankfully, the funding that Jeff was previously talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| which is TPO funding, when you use federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| that's when you have to do a NEPA analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| That's where that red kind of octagonal shape there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| What is NEPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| I don't know exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| National Environment Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| When the county does projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| we obtain the necessary permits and do environmental analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| We just don't do it with the robustness that the federal government requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| For instance, on Lovell Road, the section from Schaefer to Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| that project has been in NEPA for over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| It looks at the historic, the cultural, the environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and it just takes a significant amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| But once you move through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| then you end up into final engineering design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| or which you end up with a right-of-way plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| I mean, all this to say that when it comes to timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| it depends on if it's purely a Knox County road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| or if it's a Knox County road or a state road and has state money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| or if it also has federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| those timelines obviously get extended beyond there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| or if there's jurisdictional elements with each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| So there's no easy answer to say how long does it take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| because it could be a year, it could be ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| And a lot of it depends on the funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I mean, we can do the Gibbs Middle School project was a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| We were notified that that project was ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and we had the road improvements designed, right-of-way purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| and built in less than 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| So when you have little constraints, you can move very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| but obviously in some cases the NEPA phase alone may take three to four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| But once we have right-of-way plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| then we go and start actually procuring the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| which is what we're doing on Shod Road now near the golf course section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| We're acquiring the right-of-way, relocating the folks necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| and then once the right-of-ways are established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| and the utilities have their plans in order, then we go to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| Can you help explain just that part of the process with the right-of-way acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, we have a certain amount of jurisdiction, right, on either side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Just explain how that process works and how an old country road becomes a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Yeah, and that goes into some of the things that Amy talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| as far as the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Anytime someone subdivides property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| they're required to dedicate property to the county per the major road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| that the Planning Commission adopts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And that's based on, you know, if it's a collector road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| you have a right-of-way that may be 70, 80 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| or if you have a local road that is most likely going to experience a lot of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| it may be 25 feet from the center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| So what we do is during the initial design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| we establish those front corners, whatever they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| They may be one of those deeds called the center of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| so we identify the center of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| And then we establish what we need to include the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| including the drainage, the sidewalks, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And we usually set, you know, in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| at least four to five feet off the back of the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| to accommodate for maintenance long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And so there's that difference between where the property pins are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| and where we need to be able to maintain the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| And we establish that in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| It's usually a square-foot basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| And we do an appraisal of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Sometimes that appraisal is just the land value itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Sometimes it involves damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Sometimes that acquisition is so close to someone's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| that their house that's worth $300,000 today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| when the roads move that much closer to them, their house may be $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| So we pay for the land plus the $100,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| So it's the goal in our right-of-way acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| to make the landowner whole once the project's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Sometimes you have to acquire the whole property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| because it's going to be either too close or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| And oftentimes, when it's those situations where it's so close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| we'll actually work with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| and give them the option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Some people, you know, have obviously sentimental value for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| and they want to stay there and we'll accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| And other people, you know, they want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| and we'll certainly accommodate those folks' wishes to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And I guess those slides are where we were and what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| The next slide is really where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And, you know, one of the mayor's main priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| is to align smart growth with smart infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| We spend a lot of money on infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| and we want to make smart investments in both growth and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| And this comprehensive land use and transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| is the way we feel like that best does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| In the past, there's never been a comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| and transportation plan done at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| We feel like this is a really good thing for the community to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| One of the things we're going to do to ensure this plan is a success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| is to partner with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| You know, the public is greatly involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| In addition to the public, we want to partner with the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| We want to partner with the utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| because everybody knows what drives growth is infrastructure, schools, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| So we're going to meet with those folks, bring those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| We also have met with and talked to the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| They're not participating directly in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| but they've committed to being a key stakeholder in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| because, obviously, to Jeff's point about regional growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| everything ties together, so we want to involve all our partners on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| so that they are barely aware of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Next slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Key outcomes, obviously, we want a blueprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| for the way the county is going to grow responsibly for the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| One of the things that is maybe not denoted here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| but one of the things that I want to do when this plan gets complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| is to update our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| If you look at our zoning ordinance, it was created many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| and the uses that are in there that Amy notes, by right and by use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| nobody uses anymore, but everybody wants a food truck park now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| and our zoning ordinance don't talk about food truck parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| So there's a lot of new uses that we want to add and make available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| So that's something that, once this plan is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| we would also like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| and we also want to just align our capital roadway improvements with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I feel like oftentimes we've been a little reactionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| with infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| I think one of the hopes that I have with this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| is that where we anticipate growth to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| that our infrastructure can be built in advance of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| or at least at the same time of it, rather than being reactionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| And the timeframe of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| we released the letter of interest last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| We are using TDOT and federal funding for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| We anticipate the project's probably going to be close to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| So we secured $500,000 of federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| and so we're leveraging about essentially half of the cost of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| is covered by federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| So in doing so, a little more strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| We have to do a two-step RFQ process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| So we actually won't start the consultant interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| until probably a couple of months out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| and then actually get the project kicked off in the fall of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Obviously, it's a very time-intensive process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| so we do anticipate for it to take about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| How do you reconcile with a growing county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| that is moving at lightning speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| with a process to just begin the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| of what we look like 20 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| that is probably going to take the first three to years to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| It seems like we're moving like snails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| and our county is moving like jackrabbits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| How do we balance the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| That's a million-dollar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I'm going to have to ask our planning director to help me on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| No, no, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| I mean, look, these are really important things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| and they're important to be thoughtful about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| and important to do comprehensive plans, bring in experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| have the best and brightest at the table and understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| But it also seems like by the time we actually get done with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| we're almost already behind in the next process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| and the next process and the next process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Is that just the nature of the beast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I think that's just the nature of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| You've got to start. You've got to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| And one thing I think I regretted in mentioning that I meant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| is unlike the previous general plan we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| and the mayor has encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| we want to do continual updates on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| This isn't a plan that we want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and then put on a bookshelf like the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I mean, Mayor Jacobs has indicated that he's very supportive of updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So to your point, as things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| we want to be nimble enough to update that plan accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Does where we're heading in that allow us to be more nimble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| I mean, maybe I use the analogy of speed boats versus ocean liners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Do we have the ability to be more reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| or does it require going back through either a full legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| or a full zoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| How fast is nimble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I think that's yet to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I think that's discussions I think we need to have as part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| to create this new land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| And what is the best way to keep it updated for this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| And looking at all the different types of plans that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and do a comprehensive evaluation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Commissioner Smith, did you want to join?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I was just going to say, I won't name names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| but there are some that have for six years been saying that our growth plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| and all these need to be updated, and it's just hard to get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| But even in that case, it still wouldn't have been ready enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| to help with the surge of growth we're having right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| But, yes, we are late to getting to the game on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| and it's something that, quite honestly, I've pushed for about the whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| I've been on commission because I saw the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| That's the hard part, too, is in addition to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| which is going to grow at the pace it's going to grow legislatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| you only have your local elected leadership is only usually in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| of decision-making for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| And so by the time you sort of comprehensively get a community-wide vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| of where we are, then you have a whole new set of community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and maybe a new vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| So you're constantly, I mean, that could be a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| or it could be a totally stifling thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Jim, you've been working for Knox County for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Twenty-two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Twenty-two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Have you ever seen the rapid growth that you're seeing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| in such a short period of time and the way we live changing as fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| or has it gone in a couple of waves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| In 07, 08, it was really busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| I would think we're probably a little bit busier now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| based on just the sheer statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| But as far as practicality, it was about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I mean, it ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I'm very excited that this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| I know that you all are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And I'm going to put you both on the spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| I know that realistically, anyway, at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| state requirements and federal requirements cannot be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| I mean, they just kind of are what they are for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| But you two are our leaders in processing our county growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:42| And I know that you both share obstacles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| that it's like if I could change one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| that would just be a huge hurdle to allow us as a county to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| to move forward more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| or to have decisions made in a more efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| What would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| What would you tell these consultants that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| if we could just get even this adjusted or changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| it would make a huge difference in how we function as a county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| I know you both have probably got a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Talk to me about us, about what some of those things might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| If only we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| You know, for me, Commissioner Smith's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| I'm kind of on the back end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| I'm a little downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| So, for me, it really is resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| It's having the funding to do some of the things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| It's hard to improve things that we need to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| without the necessary resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| So I would think, at least for my first flush on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| would be that sometimes the resources are a little bit lacking potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| And I might suggest part of the problem may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I understand that you're not a land planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| but certainly what your expertise is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| it lends to, I mean, the whole big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| So if you were used more on the front end instead of the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| as far as the anticipation of things occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| is that something that we need to change that structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| It's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| I mean, you do hear a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I believe I'd want to think through that a little before I offered a clear opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| But that is a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| I don't know that I see a real quick, like, this is what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| I think I'm really excited for this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| to be able to update this comprehensive land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| and also incorporate transportation because, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| it's all interconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| And to be able to look at this together is really how we should be doing planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| And I would say, you know, Jim's already alluded to it, our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And, again, this is not going to be a quick, hey, we need to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Nothing can be fixed really quickly with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| when we're talking about land use and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| But our zoning ordinance, it's really challenging for us on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| The requests that we're getting, it just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| Jim mentioned the food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| It's just really challenging for our staff and their staff to try to figure out where this fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| So I think I'm really excited because I think that we're doing something that's really positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| and that's going to have some huge impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| And, unfortunately, it's not going to happen tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| But, you know, 18 months in the grand scheme of things is not that long if we can get it done then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| So do you anticipate that this will be the role of these consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| that they're going to really listen to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| because you know our county better, certainly better than they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| and really incorporate these kind of things into this master plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| I think that's the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Not only do they listen to staff, but they listen to all the key stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| That's the community, that's our elected and appointed officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| That will be the expectation of anybody that's brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| I have some good questions related to this, but I want to maybe finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Yeah, and this is just the last slide, and then we can turn to field questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| This is just kind of, I guess, the leadership team in the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Chris Caldwell and Mandy Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| In my office, myself and Kathy Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And then in the planning will be Amy Brooks, Jeff Welch, and Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| So we appreciate everybody's time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| A couple quick questions, really good ones as it pertains to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| from our members of the public that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| And whoever wants to jump in and take them, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| The question is, I understand that the general plan update will apply only to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| unincorporated parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| However, the city affects the county and vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| especially when it comes to infrastructure, schools, traffic, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| How will this be dealt with within the update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Basically, how will we also consider that things beyond just the county limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| I think that gets into, you know, Jim had mentioned the key stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| and that Farragut and both the city of Knoxville are committed to participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| And they'll, I mean, we'll tackle them as they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Would you say, when we talked about our zoning sort of limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| we talk about that a lot when things come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| and we can't really quite figure out what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| it seems like we're structured to have three units an acre sprawl pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| everywhere and not a lot of innovative land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Is it just a simply we're not, we're structured for how it was 20, 30, 40 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| not how we want to be 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| I think that we need to take a look at that growth policy plan and look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| and where those designations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| I think it's time for us to reevaluate where those boundaries are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Where does it make sense to grow and where does it make sense to preserve land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Yeah, we've had a lot of conversations where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| you have a piece of property right even near a brand-new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| and yet that's not in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| And you just go, how can this not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Of course it's in a growth area of a brand-new school, but yet it still struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| A couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Will the general plan include a cost-benefit analysis or develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| I think it probably means for development so we understand the fiscal impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| and will any part of the plan be codified or will it be advisory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| Or do we know yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| So maybe pick those into two different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Mr. Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| On the first part, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Our RFQ, the language that we're tasking the consultant to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| is included a cost-benefit analysis, much like that question entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| So, yes, the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| We want to know is this development going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| is it a financial benefit to Noss County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| What about the, will this part, will the plan be codified or will it be advisory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| I mean, what status will that be in or will it be determined later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| I think that's to be determined later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Obviously, I think we'd hope that undertaking an effort of this magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| would go to the process and be recommended by Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| and adopted by Noss County Commission, but that would be up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| If you don't know this number, that's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and I didn't see it either in the facts and figures or the last annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| but there was a presentation I think last year that said that we were on pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| to have 100,000 to 200,000 more people move into Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| in the next 10 to 20 years approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Is that still on pace for that kind of rapid growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| I don't have those exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Jeff, do you know from the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| For our region where I think we're looking at about 180,000 growth in the next 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| it's gone down since our latest projections five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| just because the birth rate has gone down in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| and obviously the death rate has gone up higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And over 50% of that is going to occur in Noss County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| but that's why we update these projections about every four to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| to get a better handle on what those are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| That kind of information is really going to be relevant to the general plan update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| to say, okay, folks, we've got to hone in on what's the population going to be in 2045 or 2050,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| and that's how we want to be able to plan and accommodate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Yeah, I mean if our population is going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| could be as much as half as more in that period of time, that's daunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Yeah, and as a result of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| if more folks are going to be leaving the larger cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| or just the higher cost areas, are we going to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Tennessee is getting a large share, but what's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| is our share going to be 5% and middle Tennessee is still going to get 65%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| or are people going to get tired of middle Tennessee and it's better in east Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| It's hard to predict, but definitely that's why we want to keep careful looks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| Commissioner Stern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you, and Jeff, that's kind of what I wanted to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| and see if we are looking into it, the migration of our country to different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| but also the pandemic has brought about workforce changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| It's brought about delivery systems and product goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| and commercial business changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| How deep do we need to look into that and consider when making these new plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| or do we think this is more of things will eventually flow back to normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| I'm not an economist to really do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| and I think that's why we're looking at our partners with the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| our Chamber of Commerce here to envision that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| Two years ago, who would have thought, at least maybe the Chamber figured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| that there's going to be three Amazon facilities here in east Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| two in Blount County and one in Knox County here opening in the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| I think that's here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I think our greatest opportunities is what is the type of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| that we will have and how we will utilize that vast amount of commercial land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| that we have out here that is basically a gray field in some respects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and how can we accommodate future growth in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| and create new businesses along those corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| where we have the infrastructure of sewer and water and gas, electric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and streets and highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| So all those things, I think the pandemic is still a little bit too early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| to see what's the long-term impact on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| but telecommunity is probably here to stay for a significant share of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| or a business that will still encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| And Director Snowden, we often talk about chasing population with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3498)|
| 0:58:27| and in a free market society, it's not necessarily always true to say build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| and they will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| If you don't have landowners willing to sell, people wanting to live in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| you can build a road, and it doesn't necessarily mean that that's where growth will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| What are the areas that you see where the market is telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| that growth is going to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| And that's for you too, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| I think I mentioned previously the things that we see, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| transportation infrastructure is one of the things that we look towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| I think school construction as well as utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| So I think you look at all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I could see the Gibbs area being a location that would want to see growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| You've got a lot of good amenities out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| and pretty decent infrastructure transportation-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| I think there's some utility issues that may be somewhat limiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| but that's one location I think that could experience some growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| just because of the key factors of those three elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| And when we go into these areas to, I call it stage for growth with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:50| how do I say this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| I know in Hardin Valley there was a time that five lanes were wanted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| four lanes and a turn lane, and the community didn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| And here we sit 25 years later, and now they all want five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| At what point do you take the community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| but do you also let the professionals who surely have the vision to see what's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| how do you weigh and balance that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| That's a tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Obviously we always want to support things with the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| Based on your current ADT and your annual growth rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| you want to be able to, that road that you build today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| you want it to operate at a good level of service for the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Your ride in Hardin Valley, that was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| It was one of the first projects I worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| It went from a multi-lane to essentially a two or three lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| and now it's got 15,000 cars a day on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| and in hindsight we probably should have built a five lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| But a lot of that is policy matters that us as engineers or planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| we just recommend those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| I think we need to obviously look at the data first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| That data is not emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| It's something that is easily quantified, but that's a tough conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| I think that is the hardest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| We experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| You can look at Hardin Valley, Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike, North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| every one of these old country roads that used to be a few housing developments on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| are now major arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Emery Road is another major artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Across the county it's an impossible conversation because on one side you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| community members that don't want any more growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| It's the I want to be the last one to build, close it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| but I don't want any more traffic, so we've got to relieve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| versus I want more growth, but where are you going to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I don't know how you balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| That's the politics of it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| I always said water goes where it wants to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| and growth goes where there is available land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and the easy land is gone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| If you see the growth patterns over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| I would be fascinated to see a growth chart over the last 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| year by year by year animated, and see it creep west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| I said too long ago that Cedar Bluff was pasture land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| and in a heartbeat that grew west into Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| and then now it's gone over into Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| and it's going to have to start creeping back through Carnes and Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| and Corryton and Shaw Plains, and that's where the land is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| At the same time, when you're constrained with some of your zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| that only allows for X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| You're not thinking about building up or building differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| or building in more innovative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| It's just the sprawl that we all fight against of how can we do it different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| instead of just having the same sprawl after sprawl after sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| but chicken or egg, build it, don't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| The data will tell you when it's too late, not when it needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| I mean arguably Hardin Valley Road ought to be two lanes and a turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| all the way to Watt Road tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| but if that came up in a community conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I guarantee you would have pitchforks on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| and drivers on the other side, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And that's not an impossible discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| I mean I think it happened even in the city of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| That has become a huge artery, and that was at one point, if I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| that was going to be a widened major artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| So I don't know the answer to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| It's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| All right, a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| These are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| And if you have more questions, send them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| When we run out of questions and topics, we'll end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| So now's your shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Is there a mechanism to evaluate if the tax productivity of current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| and future development patterns financially support the transportation investments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I think that maybe ties to one of the other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| How do you know what's the balance of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| and how much that will produce to help with future growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Is that along the same ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| And is there a road inventory survey that guides capital investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| where they're needed most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| So is that the data that you're talking about, or is there a different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| That – hang on, let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:50| This slide here talks about how we've established needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| And then this slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| and I'll be more than happy to share this document with anybody that would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| It's a very large document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| but it essentially addresses every collector and above in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| so pretty much any road that connects two roads together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| We've looked at the width of that road, the ADT on that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| or the average daily traffic on that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| as well as the crashes, the types of crashes, the severity of the crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| and looked at ways – and ranked them from one to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| I think there was something like 540 segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| So that's how we have prioritized up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| And then this plan will help us take this model and actually expand upon it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| and even make it a little better by using the growth that may be occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| Mr. Stone, you talked about the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| This may be an impossible question, but if you had a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| given all that you know about how many miles of road we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| how much paving we do every year, how much money we spend on infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I mean, if you had a magic wand and a budget to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| what's the multiplier of what we should be doing to get prepared for growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| Should we be doubling our efforts tomorrow to keep up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| or should we be tripling it? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| I don't know what my capital budget this year was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| I think it was about $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| This chart that's on your lower left there, that's the top 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| I looked at that, and it said to improve those to what was recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| it was $75 million, and that's just the top 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| So we're not even scratching the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Unfortunately, I think I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| and I think this number is still somewhat relevant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| I think it's $500 per lane mile per foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| I mean, the numbers are astronomical is what it takes to design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| purchase the right-of-way, and construct a roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| So it's a daunting task financially, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Are there other questions from commissioners or from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| That sort of concludes the impossible questions at the end of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| but I'll open the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Any commissioners have any other thoughts or questions or comments for our team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| Well, seeing none, I'll just wrap it up by saying to those who are with us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| please understand the myriad of resources you have at your fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| You also have commissioners that certainly can engage and find out more answers for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| but I've never found a time in my tenure here on commission that the planning department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| the engineering department hasn't said how can we help, what can we provide more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| been accessible, open to information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| You may not like the answer, but it doesn't mean you won't get the information to better inform you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you for putting the presentation together and being a resource for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| So with that, we'll conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Thank you very much, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210607-chairmans-briefing?start=4094)|
