| 0:01:14| But before that, I just want to put one thing in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| I'd like to thank all of our veterans who are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| Today is the 75th anniversary of the landing at D-Day, so it's a very important day in our nation's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=81)|
| 0:01:30| And I just want to say, while we all come together, we have animated discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| and we're all working on trying to do the best things for our community, some of our challenges today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| I look at what that generation that came before us went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| and I'm just absolutely grateful for their sacrifice for our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| But Mr. Baylor, if you could go ahead and lead us in the Pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Please stand and salute your nation's flag and join me in the Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=126)|
| 0:02:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| The purpose of today's meeting is to vote on the Knox County budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| The fiscal year starts in July, and by the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| the county commission is required to have a budget passed by the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Otherwise, the budget for next year will default to basically the same budget that we've had the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=154)|
| 0:02:41| We have one, two, three, four, five actual items that we will be voting on at this particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| The items are related to the budget in general, the tax rates, the five-year capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| some nonprofit appropriations through defined service contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| and then, finally, the approving of the organizational chart for the executive branch of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=182)|
| 0:03:11| I also want to thank some of our special guests who are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=191)|

| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Madam Clerk, would you get to the first order of business, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| This is Resolution R-19-6-101-SS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations from the several funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| for departments, institutions, offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019, and ending June 30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Okay, there's a motion for approval by Commissioner Schoonmaker, and there's a second by, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| By Beeler. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Before we vote, we have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Yes, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| In light of all the discussions that we've had in the community, the input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| I think it appropriate to offer up a substitute motion to approve the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| with the addition of adding back in the indigent care funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| and them coming out of undesignated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Commissioner Anders has made a motion to, a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| to have the budget where it is but adding back in the originally budgeted number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| the prior year budget for the indigent care program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Is that Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| We have a first and a second for the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| and now, Commissioner Gill, you're recognized for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Could we indicate what that amount would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| What would that exact amount be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I need to ask Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Yes, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Would he indicate what the amount is so we can include it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| The amount to the adopted budget amount is $4,316,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=333)|
| 0:05:44| What was the reduction, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| $321,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| That's a rough guess on top of my head, but I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| That was the total post-reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| I think what Commissioner Gill is asking and Commissioner Anders was asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| was what is the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| I think it was around $1.2 million, which was the change in the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| It was a decrease of $1,321,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Does that answer your question, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Yes, and I think it needs to be a part of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| if we're to have the amount back in the line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| And Cherokee is also here if we have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| as we continue to talk about this issue present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Just a question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Mr. Anders, is that for recurring dollars or one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Well, my thought was is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| the proposal was to be creative with the indigent care funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| and slashing them by 43% to one entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| and more cuts to the hospitals is not creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| It's just cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| And my hope is that over the next year we can redefine what our indigent care plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| and what it looks like and how it serves our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| But, you know, we go through this process every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| You know, last year we talked about Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| The year before that we talked about the AVID program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| The year before that we were talking about cutting teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| It just seems like it's sad that we're in a state as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| where we're just waiting until the budget comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| and has such a drastic impact on some organizations so we can have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| It should be done over the year's time, and that's what I hope that we do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| So the reason I ask, if it's recurring, that does go against our fund balance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| that that commission adopted, that you cannot pass a recurring expense for one time dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| And so if it is for recurring expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| then you have to cut something else to make up the difference of this increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| or increase the revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| If it's one time, if it's a one-time increase, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| But there has to be some clarification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I'll make it a one-time issue until we can clarify what our indigent care program looks like for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| Okay, I'm going to restate Commissioner Anders' motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| just so that he made a substitute motion from the original motion to pass the budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| His substitute motion was seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| It calls for use of one-time dollars to bring the indigent care budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| through the Knox County Health Department to the same level it was funded at last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| through an add back of, I think it was $1,321,500, I think it was, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=528)|
| 0:08:58| Any additional discussion of Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Mr. Caldwell, just for clarification, where are these one-time dollars coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| So Commissioner Anders said undesignated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| And so we do have some items coming from there this year that's already in this proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| Two big items are the $800,000 payment for the Lonsdale construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| and $750,000 for a reading program that John Roswick is going to pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=571)|
| 0:09:41| and see if that works and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And so ultimately, that's the two big pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| There's some other minor pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| So what this amendment does is increase the budget by that $1.3 million figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| but increase the use of undesignated fund balance from $1.7 to about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=596)|
| 0:10:07| So our total budget is going to be $154 million then, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| If you're adding it to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| It would be an addition, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| And so what the proposed amendment would do is add $1.3 million to the $853.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| so you'd be at $854,436, I think, if I do the number correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| And the mayor proposed an $853 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Mr. Schoonmaker, any additional follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| I guess my – well, I see some other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| I'll defer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Mr. Caldwell, can I ask you a question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| So what we're doing right now, are we increasing the budget one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| and next year when the budget comes in, what would be our starting figure on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| Would it go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Would that $1.3 come off and we'd start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| The adopted budget would not change, and so it would still show the $854,336,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| if that's the number, $436,710.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| So that's what it would show as an adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So if this body adopts the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| it will adopt a higher budget than what is in the proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| But it is true that if it's a one-time expense, then that expense goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| but your adopted number will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| So if it could have been $854, it could have been $854 first instead of the $853, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| I think ultimately the mayor proposed a budget that he was comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| that he thought was within revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Thus, that's why the proposal of the $853.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I'd like to ask our mayor to come up and talk about this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and talk about his reasons for proposing this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| and what his commitment is to the indigent care program and the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| So when we originally proposed this budget and the indigent care program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| we talked to Dr. Buchanan about a cut to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| And we proposed a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Dr. Buchanan went back and talked with the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| and said that they weren't comfortable with that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| and could we add more money to it, which is what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| So it was our understanding that the providers, while we understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| that we'd put more of a strain on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| And as we all know, our entire medical system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| our entire health care system is under strain right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| frankly because of too much government involvement already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| And when we look at things like Medicare reimbursements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| they're all hurting and they do a great job in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| But we also have responsibility to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| So we realized that that would put a strain on them, and they admitted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| But they said that they could handle the cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| And I told them that I would not plan on cutting anymore after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| This would be the last time that we would have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| So I was under the assumption that our partners and stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| were okay with this particular funding level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| The reason that we proposed this is when we look at the history of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| we realize there's some inefficiencies with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| This is just another example of government throwing money at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and expecting it to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| So the real point here is to try to impel all of us to look at programs like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| and to make sure that the money is being used effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And frankly, it was not all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| You've heard Dr. Buchanan talk about how we've had hospitals on retainer for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| and they've never even seen a single patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| That's a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| In addition, when we look at the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| you have to be a resident of Knox County for 30 days under this program to be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| So you can come here and basically be able to get a utility bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| or a note from a provider that you've been here only 30 days and you're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| What about all the people that have lived here all their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| that are not eligible for coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| What about all the people out there who are barely making it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| barely can pay their own health insurance, but they're paying for this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| So when I look at that, I think it's extremely unfair to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Again, the impetus behind this is as a community to work on this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| to work with everyone involved here to make this better, to make this program better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Sometimes you have to make cuts to do that, and that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| It's not about hurting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| It's about providing better services for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So that was our thought in proposing this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| I have one additional follow-up question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| Mr. Caldwell, can you give me the total amount that we have budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| and paid for through this program for the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| The last ten years as a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| So there's, like, three different pieces to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| There's a bucket for Cherokee, which is primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| There is a bucket for specialty hospitals, and there's a bucket for specialty providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| Here comes Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| She has the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And also for durable equipment, and then there's also one for the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| Can we get to you in a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| We need to do some math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Just real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| The total amount in this budget is used every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| and it's changed over the ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| It's changed a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| So she's adding up all the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And so every year we do use the entirety of the budget to pay for the care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| and the pharmaceuticals and other medical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Is the program right-sized to the number of people, or is it you use the whole money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| or you see all 1,100 I think is the number that has been referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| or you see 900 or serve 900 people, or is it sort of a block grant, so to speak, program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| So the 1,100 cap that you referred to is based on Cherokee's cost per person to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| That's just Cherokee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| That's not the whole program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Well, so I'm talking about if we talk about how we decided on the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So Cherokee's portion was decided based on what their estimated cost per patient would be to see 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| Obviously it's more than that that they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It's more in the ballpark of 2,000 people, because people roll off and roll on and all of that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| And then the hospital portion and the specialty care portion is not changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| no matter how many people are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| So if they see one person or 2,000 people, it's the same dollar investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| It's the same dollar amount, but so when we pay the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| we have historically paid them at about 10% or less of what they actually provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| So that does vary based on the number of people they serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| but it still is way less than the actual cost of providing that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| When we look at specialty care providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| they get reimbursed at a rate of about 15% to 16% of what they bill us for when somebody goes to see the cardiologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| Again, quite a reduced amount compared to the care they're providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| So those have remained stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| And then when we look at that one other piece of durable medical equipment, we do not get a discount on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| We pay full price for those things, and we use that portion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| The total is $46,650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Over a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Since 2008, Knox County has invested $46 million in indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| It's 2008 to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you very much for the additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| I recognize that Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Gill's lights are on, but both have chimed in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| so my next is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| This is a resolution that we will hear on the 17th and 24th, and we need to hear from Cherokee Health and other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| So I think we're jumping the guns a little bit here since we need to have more public input on the 17th and 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1202)|
| 0:20:11| So I still have some questions to Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| I see that they're here today, but this is not a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| This is a budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| So I would like to ask these questions to them on the 17th and the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| I will say if you've got someone here, you want to ask them a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| It's not a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| It's any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| If a commissioner has a question and they want to ask a department head, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| But if that's your preference before moving on, you certainly have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| But moving on, any other questions or anything like that, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| We're going to go back to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| I want to be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| I just simply want to make sure we understand that this program lessens the disparity in the community that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| It facilitates access to health care, and it gives the least of these constituents that we serve an opportunity to have any health care period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1267)|
| 0:21:21| And as I stated two years ago, the conversation regarding what we do as a body needs to look long-term at our budgeting priorities for this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1281)|
| 0:21:32| because this is a budgeting priority to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It is a priority no matter where we are in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Access to health care, lessening the disparities, and allowing people to look to make sure this is about total wellness and not just about medical coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1298)|
| 0:21:50| This is about the entire individual, whether they are under a bridge, in the city boundaries, or in the extended county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| Having access to health care, lessening those disparities, and serving the needs of people is a priority and should be in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Dr. Buchanan, do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1332)|
| 0:22:25| If there was an indigent individual who lived in Blount County and they needed services, they would go to Blount Memorial Hospital, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| At that point, Blount Memorial would be on the hook for 100% of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, they'd go through their billing process, and if the patient didn't pay, yes, they would be on the hook for 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| We're the only county in basically this East Tennessee area that has a program like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| And the other thing is I think there's a misconception on the term indigent care because if we, per se, had 10,000 people in Knox County that qualified as low income and were classified as indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1375)|
| 0:23:11| the public, because of this discussion, believes that we're cutting off health benefits to those people, that they don't have access to health care, and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1391)|
| 0:23:23| If they go to the University of Tennessee Medical Center or wherever, they're going to get treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| So really this is a financial assistance program for the providers of health care because this money does not go to those 1,100 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1411)|
| 0:23:42| It's to help recoup the costs that were if they went to UT for whatever treatment, instead of UT being on the hook for 100%, as you just testified, we now pay 10% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1422)|
| 0:23:57| So it's not that we're denying any kind of service to indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| We're just working with our providers to come up with a reasonable cost just the same as when if you're Blue Cross or Humana or UnitedHealthcare, those all have negotiated rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1442)|
| 0:24:16| That when you go in for service, you don't pay 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| You're probably only paying 62% of what the actual billing cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| So to me, I think the term that the department's using of indigent care is sending the wrong signal here because this is not denying anybody in Knox County access to some kind of health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1465)|
| 0:24:41| This is just a financial assistance program to offset the cost to Cherokee Health, to UT, and is there a third provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1481)|
| 0:24:51| Well, all the hospitals participate, and then the specialty care providers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| And then the folks that provide the medical equipment, I don't understand why we're paying 100% on the dollar on that either because everybody else has a negotiated rate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1496)|
| 0:25:06| So, again, this is not cutting indigent care in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| This is just a financial assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Fair enough, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| This is a very, very serious issue for me, my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| Most of you all know they're in the health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| And they're employed by UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| So this is contract dealing with UT Hospital and the county giving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| So it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Do I recuse myself or do I vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| So speaking from my heart and from how I was brought up and raised up, I would never be for denying somebody health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1556)|
| 0:26:11| or anything that I can help to make their life better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| And I think John has stated it really, really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Our providers out there and your physician that you go and see in clinical, they're taking less money every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1581)|
| 0:26:33| Doctors are working longer and longer instead of retiring because they are being less and less given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| Now, with all that to say, let me make it very, very clear to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| I am about helping those who need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And this is a contract that our mayor has come in and looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| He is a man that cares about everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| He has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| He has met with all the providers that this involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| And they were all fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| I have even been told that Cherokee was fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| And they were moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Every place we work at makes cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| We make cuts in our own personal finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| This is not about anybody being without health care and not being taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| And there's been a lot of stuff thrown out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And at first, I was like, what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| I don't think Mayor Jacobs would ever be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And so when I come to find out and I talk and I do some research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| and I know that my husband and my daughter and daughter-in-law see people every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| They take care of everybody, including those who are not even U.S. citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| And we spend millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| They look at everybody as being a valued person if they're in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| They don't turn anyone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| So with that being said, I do have concerns when I find out that Knox County is giving money to our health departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1702)|
| 0:28:34| and then our health department is then sending the money to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| But yet our tax dollars, we are not doing any audits on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| We do not know how the money and what it's being spent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| And so for this next year, and I believe this hasn't been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| and maybe it was very much overlooked by the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| I believe Mayor Jacobs' whole proposal with all the ones involved was he's going to look at this quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1739)|
| 0:29:08| It's going to be looked quarterly, every three months of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| And if there are changes that need to be made, then he will work with them to make these changes happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| At the end of this year, they're going to take another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| And he has made the promise that this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| He's not going to cut more from these individual providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Is that correct, Mayor Jacobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| So, you know, his team, our finance team, has done a lot of study on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| They have made these cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| We, as a county, realize that we are having to make cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| It's like, I don't think none of us want to say, were we all happy that our teachers are getting a raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Are we happy that we're being able to give our sheriff officers a raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Are we happy that we're being able to build a Lonsdale, an Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| and the property for a new Northwest Middle School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Yes and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| We have needs and needs beyond, and I wish that I could give 110% to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| but we know it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So I feel like today, because the mayor has not cut this without thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| he has not left it as an ending thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| He has said, let's meet every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Let's see where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Let's see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And so I feel like today that I have to vote on the proposed budget that Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| and his team has put together for us as elected commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and we all represent all different districts, and I think we have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| The contract with Cherokee Health is still, we have put that off for the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| and as Carson said, I believe that's the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| I believe we need to look at, see where and what they may need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| so that we can make it better, better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| Maybe provide better care for the people at Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| And so this is not about a vote where I am not taking care of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| I want to make that clear, and I hope that the media makes it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| the stand that Mayor Jacobs, you know, we can provide for our seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| and we can provide for our children and those who are in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| but somewhere we have to always tighten our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| And this is not about giving less care to anyone that we have been giving care to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| And so thank you, Mayor, for working so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| And let me tell you, this is probably the hardest thing I've seen our commissioners go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| since I've been on this commission, because I think I can speak for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| We care about people or we would not have ran for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| And it is us serving you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And I can guarantee you I'm going to try serving you 110% all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| And when it comes to your health care, I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| This is not denying health care to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Yeah, a few things to kind of follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| And, you know, we're voting on a budget issue, not a contract issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| And so Mayor Jacobs spoke about the 30-day residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| And if that's such a negative thing, why didn't he change it in the new contract they proposed in May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| Because it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| So you can't serve the same amount of people with less dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| I agree with Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| We should audit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| We should get reports based on who they see and pay them per patient basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| But the contract that you all are wanting to vote on next month and last month changes none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| It's the same contract we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Indigent care program also funds the care in the juvenile justice system and the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| The hospitals are doing that for you at 10%, 15% of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| And you're wanting to cut that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| So the things that I agree it needs a makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| I 100% agree it needs a makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| But the contract that you're about to vote on next month that we pushed off, luckily, gratefully pushed off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| is the exact same contract that we're criticizing for overfinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| And our goal should be to keep people out of the ER, not to send them to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| And if they have a primary care physician through another provider that the county is helping them with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| that's a cost savings to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| And to use Blount Memorial as an example, they are a partially county-funded hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Do you want to start running a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| When you say that Blount Memorial is on the hook for it, the residents of Blount County are on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| I want it to be redone, but I don't think you should cut 43% of their budget before you start working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| I think it's an ill-advised policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| And so the contract we can redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| I mean, because the contract I can't vote for because it changes none of the things that are bad about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| But everybody up here has already talked about ready to sign the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And so I can't be for the contract and be for the cut, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| And I think that it's appropriate to fund the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| And the reason that last week at the meeting I asked Chris, or a couple weeks ago at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| the undesignated fund balance, how much of that have we spent in the last three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I don't think we spent any of the undesignated fund balance in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| And so to put it in the budget under that line item as a one-time expense is probably not going to cost us anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| that we weren't going to spend already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And I think it is the right thing to do to fund it, but it's also the right thing to do to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| And I think it needs fixed, but I also think while you're doing that you're going to have to fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| because it's not like there's any less people knocking on the doors at Cherokee, Covenant, Tenova, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| There's not fewer people doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| But we won't cut it by 43%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| It makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| It's a terrible policy decision if you're not going to fix it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| And I think that's where we need to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| And I think we've got a year to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Cherokee, Covenant is quite capable of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| But I also think we need an audit of the program because we don't know who's using what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| And so I would urge you to consider that vote because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| This is not the first time we've cut indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Mayor Burchett cut it, restored some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| We make these decisions every year to push something on the budget and make a cut in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| No other department, I think, in the city or the county is getting cut as much as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| And I think it's bad policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| And I'll stand by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| And I'd appreciate Charles' vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| The motion on the table, I'll get back to restating that it was Commissioner Anders' substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| which was to reinstate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| So we'll have a roll call vote in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| Mr. Chairman, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| So we would be approving a budget of $854 million and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Could we get an exact number for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Because this would be the first time the commission's increased the budget from what the mayor proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| Could you restate that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| So the two changes on your summary page would be a change in the total general fund budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| and it would go to $197,620,687.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| And that would make the total gross budget $854,453,210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2244)|
| 0:37:38| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Madam Clerk, could you do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Once again, this is for the amended budget substitute motion by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| I'm going to start the roll call in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Commissioner Daley votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Commissioner Jay votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Commissioner Biggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Commissioner Gill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Commissioner Carringer votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Commissioner Bessler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Commissioner Beeler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Okay, the substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We're back to the original motion, which was item number 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| which was the consideration of a resolution of the Commission of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Knox County establishing the general county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Is there a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| We've already got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Yeah, that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| We're back to the original motion and the original second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Now, we're voting on the regular budget that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Let me ask this, Chris, if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| When we see this indigent care item come up and we see that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| not going to have the money for what we need to fund this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| help these people out, can we amend the budget later on in the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| I think to piggyback off what the mayor and Dr. Buchanan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| I think the goal is to look at this quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| and see how that process is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| We're going to do that with Dr. Lacey and also the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| and see if there is a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| If there is a negative impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| the mayor has made the promise to come back and look to fixing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| And so as we get to those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| I would imagine that if there was an issue, then, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| we would come back with a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| And go to it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| What I looked at, Mr. Chairman, I went back to the history of health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| the way it originally started out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| and what the health department we have now is not how it originally started out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| And it has grown to what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| And what we're doing is we're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| we used to have at the old health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I thought we had like x-ray machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| and we did a lot of other things over there that we don't do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| that we put out to the public for the hospitals to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| So I think we ought to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| We ought to really take a close look at our health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| what we're doing in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and what we really need to do is target the people that we can really help the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| through federal funding, state funding, and even local funding if we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| So I just, that's the one reason I voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| is to look how it started out and where we are now with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| It's not that I'm against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I think that we've got in a situation that it just keeps on growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and we'll never be able to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So, and it could bankrupt us if we keep on doing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| So anyway, that was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Also, Commissioner Buster and Commissioner Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| by the charter we have the right to amend, I guess, section 2-549,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| we'd have the right to amend an adopted budget so long as the revenues are sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Can we define what is a negative impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Because you just indicated that we'll come back on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| and indicate what is a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| And I appreciate the discussion regarding access to health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| so that people in this community serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| I'm trying to get a handle on what we mean when we say what is a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| So I think that's something that we'll have to, with our partners, Cherokee, the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| decide how we measure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| One measure will be access to specialty care, measuring that by referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| We know what the referrals are and being able to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| If we have, we can also track ER visits for the people on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| So if we're seeing an increase in ER visits, that could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| and then we have to drill down deeper to see what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So those are some measures I've thought about, about how to determine impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Cherokee knows how many people they see and how many people they serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and with those numbers we can also look at, you know, are they serving the same number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| not necessarily all of them on this contract, but on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| Cherokee, this is only about a rough estimate of about 10% of the people that are uninsured that Cherokee sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| And so it's not, they see a lot of other people, a lot of other uninsured folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| And to your point, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| one of the benefits of having them do enrollment for this program is when you come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| they can enroll you on TennCare or Medicare or some other program Cherokee has or this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| So they don't just enroll everybody on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| It expands people's options, and the people that do that, that's what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| So that helps people get access to what they really need as far as coverage goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| So I think it's a discussion we're going to have to have and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| but those are the thoughts that I've had to look at how we measure impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| And Dr. Buchanan, I might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| this may be something we discuss a little further when we review the contract in a few weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| is to, I guess, from a big picture, I'd like to see a logic model on the whole program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| We can talk offline about that, but just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| with a background in grant writing and nonprofit sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| usually for this type of service what might be helpful to communicate the outcomes for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Back to Commissioner Gill's question about what is a negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| where as we look at the outcomes for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| we may want to try to put together kind of a logic model on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| So anyhow, we can move that on to the next, when this comes back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Since this is a total budget and we're talking about things that we need in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| one of the things I want to go back to, and I mentioned this to our superintendent of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| we talked about this, we're going to improve the maintenance of effort to $506 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2692)|
| 0:45:01| He's already said that we've got too many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| We can make schools more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| And I would like this next year for us to have a real hard discussion throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| about how we can make schools more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| how can we make them better for our kids in learning by making those efficiency changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| So anyway, if you would do that for us next year, if I could get just a nod of the head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| yes, we will do some discussions and more than just one, maybe on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| see what we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| I sure would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Back to the original resolution that was before us that was properly motioned and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Is there any additional discussion on item number two on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| With that said, I'll ask the county clerk's office to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| In fact, we've had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| I'm going to ask the clerk, would you please go ahead and re-read the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| Item number two, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations from the several funds for departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| institutions, offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2019 and ending June 30th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2782)|

| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| And would you restate who is the original motion and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I made the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190606SpecialCalled?start=2796)|
