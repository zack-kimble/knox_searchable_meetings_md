| 2:30:24| and we're going to try to come up with a solution to prevent that, if at all possible, in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Thank you, Commissioner Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Jim, a couple areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| I spoke with you during the floods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| We connected with TDOT as it relates to North Shore, which is a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| Another area that was a big pressure point where we had a fatality was over on Peters Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| I was there throughout the floods talking to the kids in the kayaks down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| You had some of the neighbors, and I know the area closer to Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9050)|
| 2:30:55| especially where the power station is, that was part of the flood plain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| and then there were certain parts of North Shore which had been part of the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9059)|
| 2:31:05| You've got the neighbors out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| They think it's because we've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| I also know North Shore is right next to a lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| So, I mean, what was kind of your take on comparing that flood area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| and what do we need to be moving forward, in particular around Peters Road and the North Shore area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| Yeah, you know, the Bluegrass Lake, the only mapped outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9083)|
| 2:31:29| and there's probably, I think there's some discussion about a cave underneath it that may go into Fort Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| The only mapped outlet of Bluegrass Lake that ultimately ties a lot of that all in together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| is a 60-inch culvert that runs under Keller Bend, Tedford, and then out into the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9100)|
| 2:31:49| that TDOT actually was existing prior to the construction of Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| and TDOT left in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| We're working with TDOT to analyze that culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| and see if there's anything we can do to prevent that or to improve that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| because that is a concern of ours because there was some flooding in that area that looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| We received essentially about a 25-year storm, but we saw high water marks much higher than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| so we think that there may be some contributory factor potentially to that culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| So we're trying to, once again through this study, try to find those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| and prevent them from occurring in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| And the Peters Road area, any other take on that particular spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| You know, that area is, once again, it's all tied to sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9158)|
| 2:32:44| and when the water table was as high as it was, it's really tied to a conveyance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9164)|
| 2:32:51| so that location is just a little bit harder nut to crack really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| short of providing additional flood storage in those sinkhole areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| which would require acquisition of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| Those are tough, but we are going to look at those as well during the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| to see if there's anything that we've overlooked that might be of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| We've gone through most of the commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| Now, we've got, I'm just acknowledging that, so we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Commissioner Smith and Bussler, I'll let you all speak on this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| I'm not sure, I think it, Commissioner Smith, actually, I think you're like a month before Commissioner Bussler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9207)|
| 2:33:28| I'd like to point out that this is really an unprecedented event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| and this wasn't anything like we normally have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| You know, we often have, or not often, but sometimes have flash flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| where we have large volumes of rain come down in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| and then it rescinds pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| But we had a whole region that was inundated and saturated with water for weeks and weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| and part of our problem was, with these sinkholes and the water table so high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| TVA was trying to manage their lake systems, which were all bloated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| so they weren't able to probably release as much water as needed to help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| but at the same time, any time you move water, you're moving it somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| I'd like for people to realize and understand that this was a very, very different type of flood situation that we were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9249)|
| 2:34:16| I've lived here my whole life, and I've never seen floods of this magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| nor stretches of rain at saturation levels like they were during the last three or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9268)|
| 2:34:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| I talked about moving water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| Richie sent water down to me, and so I sent it on to Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| so that's one way to get rid of it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9275)|
| 2:34:38| But anyway, going back, one question I didn't get answered a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| I also was going to ask about have you figured out what a cost it's going to be to your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9283)|
| 2:34:51| to repair some of these issues that happened during the flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| And the second thing that came up, that about a year, a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| we were mandated or did the state come in and do a survey on culverts that go under roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| And I remember a bunch of them in my district had the little yellow stripes on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| and they did every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| Did we get any information about how those culverts were handling and if those needed to be improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9316)|
| 2:35:23| We did, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| That's part of our stormwater requirements through the state to map all our what they call flow paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9324)|
| 2:35:31| because essentially it's all related to illicit discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| When somebody spills oil here, we need to find out where it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| and the fastest way it's going to get to the natural waterway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| But as part of that process, they did look at all our culverts and did a condition assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| and we've actually replaced some due to that, so that's been a very proactive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| In regard to your question about cost, this is minus labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| because obviously our guys, you know, they're employees of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| so we're assuming that is a soft cost, including the sinkhole on Greenwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9357)|
| 2:36:03| I've got approximately about $384,000 is what the county expended with the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9363)|
| 2:36:11| from essentially February 23rd to about February, or pardon me, February 23rd to March 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| was when we were in that, you know, kind of response mode, so that was almost $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9377)|
| 2:36:26| All right, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| Can I ask a question just on that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| The soft cost in labor, do you pay your guys overtime or do they comp time or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| It's overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| We had about $25,000 in premium labor overtime or comp time, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| On top of the half a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| Jim, on where South Peters Road and Ebenezer Road connect, where Sinking Creek goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| on the west side of Ebenezer Road, under the previous administration, we sold off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9415)|
| 2:37:02| 16 to 20 acres that was all that low-lying area in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| In hindsight, where we gained $20,000, will it have been better to hang on to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| and see if we needed to do additional stormwater collection in that area if possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9433)|
| 2:37:20| A lot of that area was in the mapped floodway or the 100 and 500 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| It's very restricted in what its usage could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| Maybe we could have went in there and excavated some, but for the most part, a lot of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| the property was very encumbered due to easements that we previously had on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| Someone really couldn't go in there and do much to harm it, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| Anytime you start talking about excavating for flood storage, it does become very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| But do you think, in hindsight, we should have just maintained that property in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9475)|
| 2:38:02| I don't know. I'd want to look at the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| I don't know if I would want to say, I don't think I'd want to make an answer to that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9485)|
| 2:38:11| without really looking at it a little closer, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| Can I ask a question follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| Sure, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| On a piece of property like that, could we not have went in and dug down and created more storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| That was my point, was for the $20,000 that we sold the property for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| with all that flooding and all that damage to that home, I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| And that's possible. We can look into that and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| The amount of excavation needed would have been very expensive, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| So, I mean, it's all about a cost-benefit relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| But we can take a look at that particular location and see what we might could have done differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| And this is just an observation about your team and the excellent work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| But do we know the cost estimate of the damage in general that we're looking at for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9544)|
| 2:39:10| in the process of what that's going to look like to help families and businesses get back on their feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9550)|
| 2:39:19| But I also want to make this observation, as I drove around the city and both the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| is the amount of trash and debris that is in our system that impacted lots of roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9563)|
| 2:39:34| because of the amount of trash and debris long-term in this system that we really do have to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9574)|
| 2:39:41| because it was just extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| Yeah. You're exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| We've seen mattresses before block culverts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| And it's amazing what damage something that somebody throws out can possibly do to some private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| So those are things that are a concern of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| And that's why we work very hard to try to keep those ditches and culverts open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9600)|
| 2:40:07| Do we know the cost yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| What was the total cost damage-wise for the state's impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| At this point in time, I know what our costs are, but I don't have the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| I know I spoke to the general manager of First Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| and he alone had several sewer pump stations damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9625)|
| 2:40:29| So he had millions of dollars of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| Yep. The mayor may have an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| Yes. This is from Colin Ike. He's from REMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| This is March 7th, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| So that's a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| But as of then, private property damage was a little over $32 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9642)|
| 2:40:50| and city and county government as well as utilities was a little over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| So that will adjust somewhat, but that's sort of a preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9661)|
| 2:41:02| That's a lot. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Okay. Is there any other commissioners that have any other questions for Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9664)|
| 2:41:11| Jim, what I might say is he did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| Let's give him a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| My guys did all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9682)|
| 2:41:23| I just get out of the way and let them do what they're good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| So they deserve all the thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Take our phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| Yeah. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| That's the hard part is getting all those calls from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| Okay. That closes the discussion on that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| Item 36, discussion item regarding the essential role and responsibility of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9700)|
| 2:41:46| Okay. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| In preparation for tonight's meeting this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| it was a slow weekend as the family is away for spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| so I reread the Knox County Charter, and something stood out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| Right at the beginning of our most coveted document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| it states several times in different iterations and language that the government of Knox County shall be a public corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9725)|
| 2:42:14| So think about that description for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| We are a public corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| The charter even states that the mayor is the chief financial officer of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| a structure that's just like any other corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| We're a public corporation, yet we don't often act like one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| If I had a dollar for every time somebody's told me in the last six months as new commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Larson, stop thinking like a businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| Government isn't ever going to run like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| I'd buy you all dinner tonight after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| But why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| Because there are more voices in the room, because there's a longer decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| I really wish somebody would tell me why we shouldn't use our best business practices to run a better public corporation for our citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| We're entrusted with the public's funds, and they are our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| And with that trust and investment, shouldn't we define what our essential roles and responsibilities are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| Change in Knox County is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| Therefore, a county commission should be intentional about deliberating who we want to be and how we want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9786)|
| 2:43:14| Success will require collaboration between residents, government, community groups, neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| business owners, developers, and many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| But we must recognize that no one is more important to this process than the citizens themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| Broadly speaking, if we really wanted to run Knox County government well, we would identify issues, establish goals, assess current conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9807)|
| 2:43:36| collect data, develop implementation plans, monitor progress, and report to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| All basic business practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| In my opinion, government think, that's just my coined phrase, isn't really acceptable anymore, especially in this day and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| It's not good enough to be okay, not when we're competing for businesses to move here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| when recruiting our best and brightest to innovate and create here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| and when convincing our citizens to stay here and build a better community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| We have less than two years together as a governing body before commission seats turn over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| So what do we want to accomplish in that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| What do we want to be most proud of one day when we look back at this time together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| While other governing bodies utilize retreats and special sessions to engage in strategic visioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| we rely on work sessions like tonight to discuss and debate these issues in a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| We have a new mayor, many relatively new members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| and a sea change of new leadership across the administration and community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| So there's no better time than right now to actively discuss what our priorities should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| What are the basics that we should be brilliant at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| What should we not be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| And what should we be investing the assets of our citizens in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| This leads me to tonight's discussion item, and I pose the question to each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9889)|
| 2:44:54| What is the essential role and responsibility of local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| Tennessee's 50th chief executive, Governor Lee, spoke just blocks from here last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| and distinctly said he believed we ask government to do many things that civil society should be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| The result is an unhealthy dependency on government that undermines community cohesion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| So back to the question at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| I believe the essential role and responsibility of Knox County government is to provide a safe environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| for people to excel and achieve, to support the vital elements that enhance an excellent quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9922)|
| 2:45:29| and to provide an environment for fair business practices without undue burden or regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| I believe our investment of taxpayer resources should be limited to public safety, public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| public infrastructure, public welfare, public justice, and public elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| In closing, I'd like to reiterate we are a public corporation entrusted with public funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| that are to be used to improve the lives of our customers, the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| Simply put, improvement requires change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| But that doesn't mean that change looks the same for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| For some, change might mean investments in infrastructure that allow for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| that brings in new residents or prevents flooding, businesses and amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9965)|
| 2:46:10| For others, change might mean better sidewalks, public parks, or safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9970)|
| 2:46:16| To sustain our momentum, we must embrace policies that target investments in a defined manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9976)|
| 2:46:21| rather than attempting to spread resources with no strategic guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| I appreciate the opportunity tonight to bring the discussion item before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| I look forward to hearing your thoughts and hopefully engaging in a positive and relaxed conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| Commissioner Jay has brought a great point to us, and he's got a strong point about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| we really don't do retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| Sometimes it, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| I know it's been a long meeting, but I'm grateful for this to come to us to be perhaps part of regular discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| about who we are and what we're doing for the benefit of the citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| So what I'd like to do is we'll kind of talk about a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| This truly is an absolute discussion item, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| So I'll help facilitate the way we usually run our meetings and then add my own thoughts onto this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10029)|
| 2:47:17| But with that said, once again, thank you, Commissioner Jay, and I believe Commissioner Sall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10037)|
| 2:47:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| And first let me say, because for the last two years I've advocated that the county commission as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| look to figure out what our priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| I have said that the moment I sat in this chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| They're not only the priorities of each individual district, but what is the vision for this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| I said that the moment I sat in this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| And we continue, and a perfect example tonight is looking at how our process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10064)|
| 2:47:52| We need to look at what our process is, how to improve it, and how to better engage the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10072)|
| 2:47:59| And I want to make a remark about a statement, because this is going to impact this county considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| There are 16 schools in the first district, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| We have two high schools and the only charter academy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| And if we acknowledge between Beaumont, Chihuahua, Fair Gardens, Fort Sanders, Green Magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10094)|
| 2:48:24| Spring Hill, Vine, Holston, Lonsdale, Maynard, Sam E. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10104)|
| 2:48:32| Saramore Green, and Westview are the 16 schools that have not had a real capital investment in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10112)|
| 2:48:40| How do we expect to pay for the real capital improvement in education that we're going to be faced with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10120)|
| 2:48:47| How are we going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| So we can advocate for a new school in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| I want to know how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| And I acknowledge the school system has not presented a budget to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| and how are we going to deal with the capital, real capital improvements that are going to be required in this district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10139)|
| 2:49:07| There has not been a new school built in the first district since the city got out of the business of being in the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10147)|
| 2:49:14| And they had to be sued in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| So that capital improvement comes with a long-term conversation regarding the taxes in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10157)|
| 2:49:24| that we're going to have to address in terms of the outstanding needs, the county as a whole need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10164)|
| 2:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| Yeah, I think it's a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| You know, we've tried to dance around a little bit about, you know, what our needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10179)|
| 2:49:46| and what our plans are for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| But really, to be honest with you, and you know what, some of those schools that Mr. Gill mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| you know, some have had some improvements, Cheo Highway and Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| Holston's had a significant improvement since, you know, it closed down and became a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| Cheo Highway's had some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| But we inherited those schools in 1988, and they were old then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| I graduated from Holston in 91, and it was not in great shape when I left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| But it's had a significant $30 million, $40 million investment, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10218)|
| 2:50:22| But not only schools, you know, we don't have a plan for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| We're on a 70-year rotation for paving our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| Seventy years, you know, when people call and ask about a road or they talk about a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| I always tell them, you know, if you see the county paving a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| you better invite your grandkid out there because it's the last time it's going to be done in their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| And that's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10244)|
| 2:50:47| It's a funny joke and jest, but it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| There is no plan for growth on our road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| We are building, you know, Jim talked about coming here in, I believe he said, 1988 or 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10254)|
| 2:51:01| When he came here as an intern, Parkside Drive was starting, and he's the chief engineer when it's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10261)|
| 2:51:14| Shod Road was on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| Before I came on commission, it came off the capital plan in 2008 due to the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10277)|
| 2:51:23| and we didn't want to burden folks with a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| So we pulled most of all of our capital off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Our debt, as hard as we worked over the last eight years to lower our debt, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10290)|
| 2:51:39| it's not been a significant reduction, but we built, you know, Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| We built North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10304)|
| 2:51:45| We built Hardin Valley Middle and Gibbs Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| But, you know, the last three years we've borrowed more than we've paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| and you can't continue down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| And so I'm for Larson's discussion about sitting down, and because I can tell you more times than not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10318)|
| 2:52:07| we're telling residents we can't do something when we should be saying some of those things we can be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| I wrote down after Larson asked us to kind of have a conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10333)|
| 2:52:21| You know, we don't know as a commission what we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| We haven't had a significant roadway study in this county in over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| Shod Road extension won't be complete when my term is up, and it started in 2000, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10350)|
| 2:52:38| We lack plans on future road needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| We lack plans on future school needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| And every day or every week there's people that move into this community and invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10363)|
| 2:52:49| You know, in my district they're probably investing $200,000, $250,000 in their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10369)|
| 2:52:54| and we have sidewalks that go to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| We have safety issues around almost all of our schools and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| and we just continue to have to tell people no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| BMX track, although I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| I voted for it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| I think it's a good extension of what's been going on at Baker Creek Reserve and Himes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10387)|
| 2:53:13| and the community obviously wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| I mean, there was 30 people here tonight to talk about a BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| And, you know, but we have staff at Lonsdale passing out because of gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| and it's hard to go and spend $2 million on a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| when your staff is going to the hospital from your facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| We've got to come to the realization that we can no longer do what we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| and expect a different result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| And, Larson, if you want to schedule a Saturday morning at Himes or at the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| or at Outdoor Knox or whatever to sit down and talk about what we think the needs of the county are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10428)|
| 2:53:56| I think we ought to do it as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10436)|
| 2:53:57| I think we owe it to the citizens that we serve, and I hope that we do it pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| We have a guideline to tell us who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| The charter defines our roles as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| We have a legislative body, we have an executive branch, and we have a judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| It basically says that in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| We can make laws, we can make rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| No other branch can do that in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| Just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| We can make those rules as long as they do not conflict with state rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| So we've got defined jobs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| And the big thing that we've got to do is not have our personalities get into what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10483)|
| 2:54:50| First of all, let's talk about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| We've got 90 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| How many students have we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| We've got 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| How many students is that per school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10497)|
| 2:55:02| Some of the schools we have, it costs $5,600, $5,700 a student to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10502)|
| 2:55:08| And other schools, we're spending $10,000 to $14,000 per school to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| We've got too many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| But we would not tell the public, if we were running for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| that we've got to make some of those schools go away because they're too expensive to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| We've got a school system that wants to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| and they're telling us that they want $40 million to move their offices someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10527)|
| 2:55:33| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| Well, again, we're representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10537)|
| 2:55:42| We must listen to what the people tell us that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| We've got to tell them what they need, not what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| But we listen to what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| And we've got to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| Sometimes it's not a popular decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10555)|
| 2:55:59| But we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| To give you an example, we talk about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| How long does it take to get a road done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Powell Drive started when Bill Dunn first got in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10566)|
| 2:56:10| And he was there and told me that was one of the first roads that was opened up in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| And it took him 25 years to get that one section of road done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10574)|
| 2:56:21| We've got schools like Powell Middle School that was told to us that it was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| I look on the agenda, and I'm glad to see that they're going to finish the lunch room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| But we were told, or this commission, not this body, but this body that was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10591)|
| 2:56:39| that that school was finished and on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| And they took the additional money and put it in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| Didn't find out it was a big rock room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10605)|
| 2:56:49| Now, what do we do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| We kind of turned our back on it and said, no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| We're talking about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| Here's something else to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| In 2028, Volkswagen will be making all electric cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| GM will be making over 50% of their cars as electric cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| Where do we get our road tax from gas tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10629)|
| 2:57:16| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| Our resource where we repave and pave roads and make new roads is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| Where are we going to get that additional funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| I've asked some legislators when we were down there last time, what were we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| You know what I was told?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| We're not at critical mass right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| We'll just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| So, when we got our legislative body in Nashville not foreseeing the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10659)|
| 2:57:51| it bothers me to no end that we elect people over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10671)|
| 2:57:59| and we still get the same thing that we've always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10679)|
| 2:58:05| We are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| We voted because we thought that was the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| But the legislature didn't do that because they thought that was their complete job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10692)|
| 2:58:19| and they would be doing that for the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| When I got elected in this office, I didn't know we got paid for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| until they told me I had to fill out something and you get paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| I'll grant you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| But I thought it was a privilege to be elected to be on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| and I will represent the people in the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| and Knox County in the best interest to use the tax dollars properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10726)|
| 2:58:52| And that's our main interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| We don't have to look at what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| We're supposed to protect the people out there that put us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10736)|
| 2:59:02| I don't think we really look at that as what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| And I don't want to put, if you'll notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| I don't try to get up in front to be seen in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| I want to make sure that the people in my district know that I'm on their side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10753)|
| 2:59:19| of everything that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| And I'm on your side also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| And I'm not against you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| I'm just saying that we're doing things wrongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| Our education system is really not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| We were told that we had an exemplary school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| And they keep telling us we've got failing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| That's why we want these tax, whatever you want to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| funds to send kids to other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| Well, if some schools are passing, why aren't all schools passing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| Why do we have a school system that says we want 75% of our third graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10791)|
| 2:59:57| because that's the benchmark that they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| which means one out of every four students is going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| That's a great, great goal to go after, to make one out of every four students fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10803)|
| 3:00:13| Now, we're going to have to have a comprehensive look at education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| but we're not going to be able to do it on this body because our representatives in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10816)|
| 3:00:22| they don't want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| It's going to have to be redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| What we're doing right now is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| That's like having a 75-year-old car that the tires are worn out and the engine is almost gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| and here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10833)|
| 3:00:34| We're going to put new tires on it, tweak the engine to where it will run another thousand miles or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10834)|
| 3:00:40| and we're going to say we've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| You're either going to get a new vehicle or you're not going to get a new vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| And the only thing we can do is stand up here and say we've got to change our educational system, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| because it's not meeting the standards of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| And you talk about CTE, did you know we had automotive CTE teachers quitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10857)|
| 3:01:03| And you know why they quit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| Because the technology on cars today has passed them by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| and what they were teaching is not what those kids needed to be auto mechanics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10870)|
| 3:01:17| So there's a lot of things wrong out there, and there's a big elephant out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10877)|
| 3:01:22| Until we take the first bite out of that elephant, we're not going to eat it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10882)|
| 3:01:30| So you know what we're up against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10890)|
| 3:01:33| Well, let's look at who we are and what we are and what we can do with what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10893)|
| 3:01:39| Instead of just talking about it, let's do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| And I'm not sure exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| This body chose to look at bringing in outside things about ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10908)|
| 3:01:55| So I started looking at it to find where we could put ball fields, what we could do, how we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| Did you know that if you built those ball fields, you don't have control over them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10919)|
| 3:02:06| Even if you built those fields, we don't have control over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10926)|
| 3:02:11| And then the people we listen to won't give back the information we ask them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10931)|
| 3:02:17| That's what I want to talk about tonight, but Paul's going to be here next month, and we're going to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10937)|
| 3:02:23| It is costing us millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| We had a softball tournament that was supposed to come here that would bring in a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10946)|
| 3:02:31| They couldn't get the fields to come here because there was one individual controlling those fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| And every month we accept roads, and we don't know what the cost of those roads are going to be on us in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10956)|
| 3:02:44| But we know we're going to have to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| And somewhere along the line, we're going to have to start funding for the things we accept now for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| Now, I'm an old guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| I'm not going to see all this stuff that you all are going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| And like I said one time before, it's probably going to be on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10978)|
| 3:03:03| But I want to make sure that we're bringing in stuff that makes this county great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10983)|
| 3:03:10| that people want to look at this county and say, this is what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10990)|
| 3:03:15| And the things we don't do, we don't reward good behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| We reward bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| And that's something we've got to get doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| We've got to reward good behavior, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| And the people that are doing bad behavior, they get punished for their bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11008)|
| 3:03:34| So, now, we've got a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| So, hey, I've got three years and five months, and then I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11017)|
| 3:03:43| So, you all have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| First, I'd like to thank Commissioner Jay for putting this discussion item on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| And also, I agree with you and Commissioner Anders about doing some kind of a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11037)|
| 3:04:04| As you know, I'm very close to the elected officials in the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| and they've never done anything like a retreat before, and they just recently did one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| And two of their aldermen are very, very new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| And the response was, it was terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| And so, unless you try something, you'll never know if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| And I think that we should go forward and do an all-day Saturday event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11066)|
| 3:04:33| And I think that would be very beneficial for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| I'm going to add in right now, Commissioner Smith, I acknowledge your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| Would you like to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11084)|
| 3:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| Yeah, I think this is a good idea, too, but I don't think one day is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| I think most people think, well, hopefully not most people think like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| but I often have many good thoughts after a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| So I would think a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| This is definitely something worthy of several days of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| Maybe a weekend retreat, someplace where we can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| And I agree with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| We do need some long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| That's one of the things I've been saying for years and years is we, on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| we have our charter duties, as Commissioner Busser likes to say, but we also serve as a visionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11121)|
| 3:05:28| We also serve as leaders of the people of our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| And I think it's up to us to try to come up with plans that will meet those needs as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11131)|
| 3:05:38| for the people we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| So my suggestion is maybe we make it more than one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11140)|
| 3:05:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11143)|
| 3:05:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| I'd like to weigh in on this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| I'm really grateful for Commissioner Jay placing this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| because going into this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| it even gave me some good time to reflect in between doctor's appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11156)|
| 3:06:00| and whatnot for my son over the weekend and the fishing show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11160)|
| 3:06:06| You know, I looked, much like Charlie has said, the first thing I did was I went to our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11166)|
| 3:06:12| and I started thinking, you know, what exactly do we have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| It's like what are we charged with constitutionally as officers representing the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| And that's fairly clear in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| But what is not clear is, and this is where we can step up as leaders, is what are our priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11183)|
| 3:06:32| And I think ultimately that's sort of the question before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| that some additional time together rather than at 830 at night might be a better time to step away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11195)|
| 3:06:42| and work on that in the context of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11202)|
| 3:06:45| I mean, I could tell you what I hear from my folks in my district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| I hear loud and clear from my district they want to see more investment in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| You know, my district, I hear from them they want to see good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| I hear that loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| You know, having a background, having worked with both our partners in law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| and in the social work community, I think there is a determined role of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11223)|
| 3:07:09| at very select times to be a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| You know, if you look at the good work that our health department does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11232)|
| 3:07:15| and some of the things that government can do around protecting abused kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11235)|
| 3:07:21| But when I think about it, I think hard about safety, education, infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11241)|
| 3:07:26| and for me personally, fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| We cannot guarantee the outcome on any issue for anything that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11250)|
| 3:07:39| We all know sometimes you take a vote, somebody's going to win, somebody's going to lose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| or to strong words, sometimes you don't get the outcome that you wanted on any side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| But the one thing that we can do, and I try when I run our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| is to make sure that every voice gets heard and that we have fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| So, as we go into this session, and I'll help coordinate that as part of my duties as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11277)|
| 3:08:05| but priorities, fairness, and these core things of safety, education, and infrastructure and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11285)|
| 3:08:11| So, I mean, that's kind of my world view on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| So, that's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| I will toss it to Commissioner Biggs and then Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11296)|
| 3:08:21| Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| Like Larson said, I've only been on commission for seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| I feel like, short months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| I've learned a lot and I respect each and every person on this panel a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| And just thinking about a lot of the things that goes on with government that I've seen over quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11314)|
| 3:08:39| I think there's a lot of improvement that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| There's a lot of things we can do as a body to go ahead and make sure that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11322)|
| 3:08:45| not just us, other elected officials, put their best foot forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| And I know for a fact that Mayor Jacobs said two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| he'd like to see every district bring their top two priorities, you know, to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11332)|
| 3:08:58| Or maybe it wasn't top two, maybe it was just top priorities to the table and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11338)|
| 3:09:03| You know, whenever I very first came upon commission and was selected to represent at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11343)|
| 3:09:09| I believe that one of the things that I had no idea but I quickly saw was we were given the jails from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11349)|
| 3:09:19| we've been given schools, we've been given health department libraries, and multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| But we have school teachers that need to pay increase, sheriff's deputies that need to pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11365)|
| 3:09:30| We can't talk amongst each other because of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| There's things that we could be getting done that we could do to maybe talk to some of our surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11373)|
| 3:09:40| or other large counties that are in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| We're a part of the big four, that's what I hear every time we go out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11383)|
| 3:09:48| And I think that there's things that we could do differently, and I look forward to a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| But there's also things that we should be taking advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| One of the things that really comes to mind for me is we're going to sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| and we're going to be presented a budget soon, here in the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| It's going to be my first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| I'm excited to really dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| But there's things that we can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| Like the moment that I started looking at the mowing contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| and the thousands and thousands of dollars that we could have saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| or who services our helicopters and the thousands of dollars we could have saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| Different outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| Banking is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| I don't know if it's due to my age or what, but I'm so just pumped up to see me, Larson, Richie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11423)|
| 3:10:31| and everybody else on here bringing this new perspective to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| where we're not just zoned in like it's been done for the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| There's this huge horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| There's so much more new, fresh, innovative things that we can do on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| So I think a retreat is an awesome idea, and I welcome y'all's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| One thing that I'd like to see more, and I'm guilty of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| I would like to see more discussion on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| because a lot of times you can pass up opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| and then by the time we have a workshop, that ship has sailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| So I appreciate each and every one of you guys, and thanks for all your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| Thanks for bringing this discussion up, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| I appreciate it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11469)|
| 3:11:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11470)|
| 3:11:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11471)|
| 3:11:12| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11472)|
| 3:11:13| Going back in order of when we first addressed this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| I think Commissioner Gill, you were the first to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| and then Commissioner Anders spoke after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| So as we've all spoken, I'm going to go back to you, and then to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| I think his light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11486)|
| 3:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11487)|
| 3:11:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| And I think the opportunity to have a retreat in a public space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| but you're going to need a skilled facilitator to move through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11494)|
| 3:11:41| and each member should bring not only the priorities in their districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11501)|
| 3:11:46| but things that we need to see to build a better vision for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11506)|
| 3:11:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11510)|
| 3:11:51| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11512)|
| 3:11:53| I was going to ask John if they had a facilitator in Farragut that did theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11516)|
| 3:11:57| I'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11517)|
| 3:11:58| I would like to see their format and if they had a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| because I think it helps to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| When we had the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| I'm trying to think who did our facilitation when we had school board retreats with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11525)|
| 3:12:10| We can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| Somebody paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11531)|
| 3:12:12| It was R.T.'s Lodge up there, which was, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| the Leadership Foundation paid for it or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11535)|
| 3:12:19| Well, we can do something locally here, but I think we need a format or a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| I think it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11544)|
| 3:12:25| And I know a facilitator that could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| I think somebody at UT might have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11547)|
| 3:12:28| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| I think so, but I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| I was just going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| do you remember how long ago the school board and county commission met together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| Has that been like ten years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| That was the last year I was the chairman, so four years ago, five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| Five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11563)|
| 3:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11564)|
| 3:12:45| That's the last time we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11565)|
| 3:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11566)|
| 3:12:47| That was at Iams, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| Was that the one at Iams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11569)|
| 3:12:50| Well, we've had one at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| We've had them at R.T. Lodge when I was the chairman, me and India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| I think India was the board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| That was, I believe, the first year you were chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Yeah, and then Iams, maybe after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| That was my first year on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| I'm going to hand it back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| We just had a great, well-facilitated planning meeting over at the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| with a solid facilitator as well, but go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| Thank you all for bringing discussion to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| I didn't know if that would be crickets or conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| and I appreciate everybody's opportunity to both think about it and engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| I'm hearing pretty much everybody saying that they're open to having a retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11603)|
| 3:13:27| and I just would love to volunteer to lead the charge on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11607)|
| 3:13:33| find appropriate dates, gather all the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| I'm sure you all have facilitators that might be very qualified and able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11616)|
| 3:13:41| and there's others I know as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| This community is full of great people that have done these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| So I'd like to raise my hand and volunteer to sort of put this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11625)|
| 3:13:49| and try to do it over the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| As chairman, I'm allowed to point you to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11635)|
| 3:13:56| It might be a committee of one, but I'm happy to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| and at least sort of find a date, a plan, and a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| and then float the idea and see if we can't lock something into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| and then talk about who might be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11647)|
| 3:14:08| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11648)|
| 3:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| Now it's time we get to move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| So here's where we are in tonight's meeting, if this pleases this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11653)|
| 3:14:19| We have one item that I'd like to give a few minutes of time to tee up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| because you're going to need to do a little bit of homework between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| and the meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| Joel Holquist is here regarding the transportation improvement district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| information that's been sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| We also have on our agenda a discussion item regarding the timeline of budget votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11674)|
| 3:14:40| What I'd like to propose is that we have Joel introduce this item to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| which I've had emailed to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| but frankly I haven't had a chance to read it and drill down on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| and just for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| And then we can move the discussion regarding the timeline on voting on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| to next week's meeting, if that pleases this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| So I'm going to go ahead and call on Joel to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11700)|
| 3:15:06| Please, if you don't mind, state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| It's Joel Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| Sorry, I said Joel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11713)|
| 3:15:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| I'll just give you my home address, 2240 Fisher Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11716)|
| 3:15:21| 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| It's been a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11727)|
| 3:15:28| I've enjoyed it and really appreciate having served on city council for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11728)|
| 3:15:35| I really appreciate what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| And I'm not saying this just to schmooze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| This is encouraging to hear my county commission have this level of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11739)|
| 3:15:44| and dialogue and discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| So I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| I think it's pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| I'll try to keep this brief since it's about 830,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| and I know everybody wants to move on and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| This item is part of a – it's basically asking this commission to consider endorsing a piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11759)|
| 3:16:10| that's been introduced in the state general assembly, and it's permissive legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11770)|
| 3:16:17| It's an enabling act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| It doesn't mandate anything, doesn't require anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11779)|
| 3:16:22| I like to call it another tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| The rationale is statewide and potential impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11785)|
| 3:16:30| It's to create another tool for what's called value capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| And this goes back to some of the core issues that have been discussed during this meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11795)|
| 3:16:41| in terms of infrastructure and how do you pay for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| This is focused on public transportation, but it's a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| If it proves to be effective, there may be ways to apply it in other circumstances, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11809)|
| 3:16:55| although it's easier to actually do it in the circumstances that I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11815)|
| 3:17:01| which is fixed infrastructure, public transportation, either rail or bus rapid transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11821)|
| 3:17:08| with dedicated lanes or dedicated right-of-ways where you have control over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11828)|
| 3:17:13| as opposed to using existing road or highway lanes or lane miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11833)|
| 3:17:20| What it does is it's patterned off – it's patterned from the CBID Act of 1991, I believe it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11840)|
| 3:17:33| that enables the creation of central business improvement districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| It's the only local improvement district currently enabled under Tennessee statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11858)|
| 3:17:45| Other states have broader local improvement district statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| or they propose it in other ways that makes it either more flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11869)|
| 3:17:54| or gives special authority to do the kinds of things that we're talking about in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11874)|
| 3:18:01| There's a rationale, and I'll touch on it briefly, for why we're pursuing it now here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11881)|
| 3:18:07| and encouraging this body to endorse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| But I want to make sure that you understand that this is a piece of legislation that, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11890)|
| 3:18:17| would be an act that would apply statewide and would be available to any local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11897)|
| 3:18:25| either city or county, to utilize in order to help fund infrastructure without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11905)|
| 3:18:33| and let me repeat, without dunning the taxpayers or dipping into general tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11913)|
| 3:18:42| As you probably know, the CBIDs have a special assessment that's voted on by property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11922)|
| 3:18:49| And in this case, we're looking at special districts around station areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11929)|
| 3:18:56| We're looking primarily at rail transit, but the same can be done, again, with bus rapid transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| which has dedicated lanes and right-of-ways where those opportunities might exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11941)|
| 3:19:10| What you find with rail transit in particular, and also bus rapid transit to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11950)|
| 3:19:16| is that a lot of very high-quality development happens around the station areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11956)|
| 3:19:21| You see tremendous development and tremendous investment in those station areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| And the closest example is the light rail system in Charlotte, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11966)|
| 3:19:30| And I don't want to get into the weeds on this at this point tonight, the time being what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11970)|
| 3:19:37| but I'll be happy to answer questions either now or between now and next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11977)|
| 3:19:43| But lots of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| Charlotte, again, is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| No one in Charlotte seems to have exact numbers because it's hard to track property investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11988)|
| 3:19:55| and business investment real-time in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| But it's somewhere between $3 and $5 billion on the Charlotte blue line, light rail line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=11998)|
| 3:20:07| And it's two segments, the first being about 10 years old, going south out of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12007)|
| 3:20:12| and the second, the north segment, which was opened last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12012)|
| 3:20:16| Joel, one thing I think that would be helpful is, as I mentioned, this came in just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12016)|
| 3:20:21| We're just now kind of getting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| But just to confirm a few things, I think you mentioned that it was Senator Massey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12023)|
| 3:20:29| and Representative Dunn were carrying this legislation in Nashville already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12029)|
| 3:20:34| I shared that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| And one bit of direction I'd like to give is to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| We have a legislative committee that helps evaluate bills in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12039)|
| 3:20:45| And what I might ask is Commissioner Schoonmaker may have some specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12045)|
| 3:20:50| to help him do a little bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| And this is something that we'll probably revisit once we've all had a chance to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| Right now, to be quite blunt, I don't even know if we have enough energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12055)|
| 3:20:59| or knowledge about it to ask the right questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12061)|
| 3:21:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| In the spirit of being productive, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| You give me guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| What I would request is, just talking has kind of helped tee this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12069)|
| 3:21:12| but I'm going to check with Commissioner Schoonmaker, see if he's got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| And then what I would encourage, if you've got any additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| send it and give us a chance to read up on this before next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12079)|
| 3:21:23| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| Yeah, first, Joe, the House bill and Senate bill numbers that you're giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12085)|
| 3:21:30| are not relevant to this, the 111th General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| It looks like it was from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12094)|
| 3:21:37| I'm not sure what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| Someone may have given me the wrong number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| They initially were going to file it under, I guess, last year's numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12101)|
| 3:21:45| and that didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Anyway, somebody got things confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| There are different numbers, and I'll get those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| I'll get you the correct numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| I'm not sure what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12113)|
| 3:21:54| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| But I'll get you the correct bill numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| Okay, because the document that was sent to us is a 16-page document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| and it says at the end that it's to take effect July 1st of 2018, which is old information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12121)|
| 3:22:09| That was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| So have they filed a new bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| Because it doesn't show up on Representative Dunn's list of bills that he's introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12134)|
| 3:22:19| for this legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| It's a caption bill so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| and that was the suggestion of another Senate Transportation Committee member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| He suggested starting with a caption bill and then dropping the language in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12150)|
| 3:22:36| It's kind of an odd way that this has developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12156)|
| 3:22:40| but the intent is to take most of the language from last year's bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12160)|
| 3:22:47| make some changes in order to make it current, and fill in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12167)|
| 3:22:54| Okay, because if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| last year's bill on the light rail was actually listed under TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12176)|
| 3:23:04| under the number of electric vehicles or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| and then the paperwork was changed or the amendment was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12187)|
| 3:23:10| to actually say it was a light rail bill from the airport to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12190)|
| 3:23:16| Is this all the same component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12196)|
| 3:23:20| Yes, it's related to all that, but again, it's not about that specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12200)|
| 3:23:26| It's general enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| That's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| I'll get you the updated information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| I apologize for any confusion on the bill numbers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12221)|
| 3:23:42| Joe and I may need our State House expert to help me on this, but I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12222)|
| 3:23:51| and I've only got to read this halfway through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12231)|
| 3:23:53| but it looks a lot like some of the language that was attached to the gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12233)|
| 3:23:59| local municipalities a way and a mechanism to raise money for mass transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12239)|
| 3:24:04| What varies between this and what was in the gas tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12244)|
| 3:24:08| The IMPROVE Act, I think, is what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| There's a section that was added to the IMPROVE Act before it was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12251)|
| 3:24:16| that's essentially a cafeteria plan, if you will, for local government taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12256)|
| 3:24:23| An add-on to any one of several local government taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| the biggest one being the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| Those are taxes, and those are add-ons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| If you take action under the IMPROVE Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| it means the local governmental body puts it before the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12276)|
| 3:24:40| and they have to approve that add-on tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12280)|
| 3:24:43| This is not a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| This is a special assessment that the property owners have to vote upon themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12285)|
| 3:24:50| like the CBID is the only clear example we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12290)|
| 3:24:56| It's totally different from the IMPROVE Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| In fact, what we're trying to avoid is that kind of extra tax burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| where this is what's called value capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| Value is created by new infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| and in order to justify the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| you have to have a mechanism for capturing some of the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| that's created by that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| It's a closed loop, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| where if a developer wants to develop around a station area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| they have to agree to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12328)|
| 3:25:29| and basically they have to vote to put it in place in order to get that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12329)|
| 3:25:35| to get the infrastructure, to get the station, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| in order to create the opportunity, if you will, to build that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12338)|
| 3:25:43| So value capture is sort of a cunning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| It's an old idea made new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| We can talk about it more later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| but that's the way many of the railroads, especially the western railroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| were at least in part capitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| the land that they sold around what became stations and then towns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12358)|
| 3:26:03| So it's not a tax, and it's unrelated to the IMPROVE Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| We're trying very specifically to stay away from adding additional burdens on the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12368)|
| 3:26:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12378)|
| 3:26:19| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12379)|
| 3:26:20| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12380)|
| 3:26:21| Yeah, Joe, I think one of the things, if it's enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12381)|
| 3:26:27| is it a private act for Knox County, or is it statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12387)|
| 3:26:30| Statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| Okay, and so it's set up like a TIF or a CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12391)|
| 3:26:35| where it's specific for that area for that purpose and has to be used by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| But the way we talked about it earlier, I guess yesterday or the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| is that this is just a request to tell the state we understand it's enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12405)|
| 3:26:52| but it has to be voted on by the bodies, city and county bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| and also the people that are affected, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12418)|
| 3:26:59| You know, and I think everybody here would, number one, you've sat here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| and you know that you don't like late stuff coming across your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12426)|
| 3:27:07| But I think it would be better if there was not just a caption bill that we were trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| I feel very uncomfortable endorsing a caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| And so I'd like to see what the bill says before next week, before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| I don't mind adding it because, you know, if it's something we can add for CAT later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12441)|
| 3:27:26| or for bus transit, whatever, it's not going to hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| We're going to get to vote on it again, and the citizens are going to get to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| So I'm not, that doesn't bother me, but I can't vote and endorse a caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12453)|
| 3:27:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| I need to see the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| I feel more comfortable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| I'm hopeful that we can meet that requirement with no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12466)|
| 3:27:47| Thanks, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12467)|
| 3:27:48| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12468)|
| 3:27:49| Commissioner Bates, you had your light on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| Do you still wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| Commissioner Andrews kind of covered what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12473)|
| 3:27:56| and then I was going to ask how much do the tax revenue with the county get kind of off the CBIDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12476)|
| 3:28:03| I mean, it's just, or is it more geared towards the city and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| Yeah, CBID is, I mean, it's structured like a CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| Downtown businesses and properties have a higher tax assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| and that money goes and stays downtown in that district to do improvements for facades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12493)|
| 3:28:17| or sidewalks or other things that they granted out to rebuild or redo facades on businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12497)|
| 3:28:24| and to get a building up to structure, up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| So it's set up like a CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| That's the easiest way to explain it to a legislator, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12509)|
| 3:28:33| So we don't know how much the county tax revenue would get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| We get zero from the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12518)|
| 3:28:39| It stays in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12519)|
| 3:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12520)|
| 3:28:41| It's like a self-assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12525)|
| 3:28:46| We're talking about transportation right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| and I sit on the transportation committee as the secretary and took notes afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12528)|
| 3:28:54| And we're going to have a meeting coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| what we call our spring board meeting in Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12537)|
| 3:29:02| And we're going to be talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| and we're going to have people from the car industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| and other transportation to tell us what the future is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12546)|
| 3:29:12| And we're talking about rail here, and we're thinking about rail, what we've got now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12552)|
| 3:29:19| You know, I'm not sure that we're going to look at rail 10 or 15 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| because technology is changing so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12564)|
| 3:29:27| We don't know what the rail will look like or what it's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12567)|
| 3:29:31| or what size rail or if it's even going to ride on a rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12571)|
| 3:29:36| You know, there could be a number of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| We know the gas is going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| so we support a bill that might be outdated by the time we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12580)|
| 3:29:48| Can I respond to Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| Well, I think that's an excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| and my response to that right now would be that we really don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12592)|
| 3:29:56| just as you said, exactly what the future is going to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12596)|
| 3:30:00| This is enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| It doesn't mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12602)|
| 3:30:03| It doesn't force us to move in a particular direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| If you look at the analysis, if you look at the studies that have been done so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12606)|
| 3:30:12| on autonomous vehicles, on shared car sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12612)|
| 3:30:18| all the technologies that are proposed so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| some of the more exotic technologies like autonomous aerial vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| you know, there's all kinds of stuff that's being talked about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12627)|
| 3:30:32| but there's a lot of uncertainty as to how that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| There's no evidence clearly one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12635)|
| 3:30:40| that autonomous vehicles will reduce congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| They may, in fact, increase congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| and that's a long discussion in terms of how that might work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12646)|
| 3:30:51| So I guess my point is that I'm going back to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12651)|
| 3:30:56| We really don't know for sure how this is going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| but I think that there's enough evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12660)|
| 3:31:02| If you look at the work that's been done with Georgia Tech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| University of California Davis, they spend a lot of time on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12666)|
| 3:31:12| They come back and say, we can see where the future might take us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| but we can't tell you what the outcomes will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| whether these technologies will improve conditions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| So I think the wise thing to do is to give ourselves the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12684)|
| 3:31:29| and put the tools in the toolbox that we might need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12689)|
| 3:31:33| so that we can be prepared for whatever direction we want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12693)|
| 3:31:38| That would be my argument, and I think it's a sound argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12698)|
| 3:31:42| Well, furthering along, and this is not an argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12702)|
| 3:31:46| but the discussion with me is that since we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12706)|
| 3:31:50| and this being a captioned bill and the way they put captioned bills in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12710)|
| 3:31:56| I would like just, and it's not going to cause us to be going down one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| It's something to enable us to react quicker to the new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12722)|
| 3:32:08| And I think it's a good idea, but being as a captioned bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12728)|
| 3:32:15| I've had people tell me about captioned bills just to placate me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| and the next thing you know it's on a summer study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| which means it's gone to the elephant graveyard to just go in there and die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12740)|
| 3:32:26| So I'd rather have it more on substantial ground than a captioned bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12754)|
| 3:32:35| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12755)|
| 3:32:36| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12756)|
| 3:32:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| Joe, I found two house bills from Representative Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12759)|
| 3:32:44| One, and this is dealing with transportation issues, one was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12764)|
| 3:32:50| The other one is House Bill 789 and Senate Bill 610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12770)|
| 3:32:55| And here's what the, here's the way the bill was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12775)|
| 3:32:59| It says highways, roads, and bridges, as introduced, extends from 10 to 14 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12779)|
| 3:33:06| the time period with, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| within which the committee appointed by a county legislative body to study surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12789)|
| 3:33:16| and plans of county roads has to reduce its recommendations to writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12796)|
| 3:33:22| and file them with the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12802)|
| 3:33:24| Which bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12804)|
| 3:33:25| So this is the 789 from Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12805)|
| 3:33:28| So this is actually a captioned bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12808)|
| 3:33:30| and this is actually a great example of why, last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| it was so frustrating trying to figure out what was going on in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| that I sat down with Bill Dunn and said, we've got to change this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| because right now this bill is being held on the House clerk's desk pending the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12822)|
| 3:33:49| and it's not going to go anywhere until they have that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| and then it's going to sit there for seven days before it actually gets assigned to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12832)|
| 3:33:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12837)|
| 3:33:58| But the other one actually sounded more like what you were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| That's already been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12844)|
| 3:34:05| And that was House Bill 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12848)|
| 3:34:09| My understanding from Representative Dunn is he told me that he was going to use 789 for this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12849)|
| 3:34:16| I know the caption doesn't sound right, so we'll have to get that straightened out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12856)|
| 3:34:22| and we'll get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12862)|
| 3:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12865)|
| 3:34:26| I agree with the gentleman on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12866)|
| 3:34:28| I'm not going to support any kind of legislation under a captioned bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12868)|
| 3:34:32| until that amendment has been filed and it's actually scheduled for a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12872)|
| 3:34:36| which you're now looking at at least ten days out, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12876)|
| 3:34:43| We can file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12883)|
| 3:34:44| I'm not sure about the scheduling part, but I'll have to get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12884)|
| 3:34:50| Joe, I think the bottom line is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12890)|
| 3:34:53| y'all got a little bit more homework and some more stuff to get back to us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| You'll find that this body is always open to listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| and we're once again thankful that you brought this to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| but we just need some more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12902)|
| 3:35:04| and I'm sure this body will take some time to research this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12904)|
| 3:35:06| but we are expecting some more information from you and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12906)|
| 3:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12910)|
| 3:35:11| Are there any other commissioners that have anything else to add in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12915)|
| 3:35:16| We'll move on to we have this one item, which I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| that I'd like to carry over to Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12920)|
| 3:35:22| Otherwise, Madam Clerk, is there anything else on our book of business for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12922)|
| 3:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| The Chair will entertain a motion for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12929)|
| 3:35:30| Motion from Commissioner Bussler and a second by Mr. Schoonmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12930)|
| 3:35:34| I have one announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12934)|
| 3:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12935)|
| 3:35:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12936)|
| 3:35:37| I'd like to co-sponsor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12937)|
| 3:35:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12938)|
| 3:35:39| I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12939)|
| 3:35:40| Commissioner Gill brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12940)|
| 3:35:41| We do want to make some announcements tonight before we're officially out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| So go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12943)|
| 3:35:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12944)|
| 3:35:45| I look forward to seeing Commissioner Anders at Big Ears, which starts this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| and run for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| And the financial impact of Big Ears really should allow each and every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| to participate in free events to all the way up through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12958)|
| 3:36:04| And the Bass Classic was just phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| We'll talk about that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12968)|
| 3:36:09| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12969)|
| 3:36:10| We'll talk about the Bass Classic next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| I'm sure that's an event we can really sink a hook into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12972)|
| 3:36:15| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12977)|
| 3:36:18| That's not just a line, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12980)|
| 3:36:21| While most people in Knox County are a bit disappointed and unhappy with basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| I'm very pleased that my Bulldogs won the state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12993)|
| 3:36:34| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| I look forward to many more Chairman Fish jokes in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=12995)|
| 3:36:40| But I want a quick calendar announcement that on Wednesday, April 17th, 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| Andrew Johnson Building is our next Joint Education Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| where the Knoxville School Board will be presenting us with their budget that they will have already submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13009)|
| 3:36:56| to the mayor's office prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| So Wednesday, April 17th, we look forward to joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13019)|
| 3:37:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13023)|
| 3:37:04| Does that mean we need to tackle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| I do need an official vote to close the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| So all in favor of closing the meeting, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=13032)|
