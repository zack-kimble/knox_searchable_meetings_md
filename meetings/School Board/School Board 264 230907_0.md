| 0:12:24| Motion to send this back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| So we have a motion and a second to send this back to policy review. Discussion? Ms. Sowood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. It was my understanding in policy review that we were going to remove the first paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| that includes politically, philosophically, socially controversial and that we were going to use instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| the language from the higher ed faculty law regarding controversial issues, but this hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=771)|
| 0:13:00| It's still the same language, so I'd like to send that back to policy review so we can be sure we get the language that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Just for informational purposes, and I don't recall the exact conversation that Ms. Owens is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=790)|
| 0:13:20| but it's my understanding that both verbiages are in the policy at this point, so the language that you had requested, Ms. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=800)|
| 0:13:29| is later on in the policy, but if you feel like it needs to be reviewed more, but that's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| The discussion was replacing this with that language. So the first paragraph, all of that red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| So if we're not sure what we actually did, the reason I came up with that is because people were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| which pieces of this belonged and didn't belong in the first paragraph and whether this made it more confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| And so when I found that other language, the suggestion was to put it in place of this language, not to put it in also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=843)|
| 0:14:13| but to put it in place of that first paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't remember the exact nature of the conversation, although I do remember asking that that language be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| I just want to make sure that I'm understanding which language you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Is the language that was added, Mr. Dupler, that Ms. Owens, you're also referring to, just not in the place where you are asking for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| is in page 2, line 12, basically, and following where it talks about matters discussed in the classroom should be constrained to subjects relevant to the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=883)|
| 0:14:52| Yes. I think that was really thought that somewhere else in our other policies, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| The discussion that we were having at the time was around the first paragraph and where that language came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=899)|
| 0:15:11| And I believe that language came from another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| I remember appreciating the language that did get added to page 2 and referencing that I felt like that was better for educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| I thought they had a little more certainty about what their own competency is and what they've been educated in and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| but I honestly cannot remember where we discussed adding it, just that it would be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| My recollection is that it was really that first sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| discussion of issues in the classroom that are politically, philosophically, or socially controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| and that that was very unclear regarding what that could really mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| and that the other language would make it more appropriate for the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| It still does say that it's relevant to the subject matter being taught, related to educational objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| but there are a lot of things that are related to objectives that are not necessarily appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=970)|
| 0:16:20| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't really remember that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| but I think that if there is a question, I'm fine sending it back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| because I don't recall specifically, so I'm fine with sending it back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Part of the discussion I do remember related to that first paragraph is lines two and three that are still there now were striked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| and I believe they were striked and then this language was added in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and I think we said we wanted to make sure that that language stayed and we wanted to make it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| which it was bumped down a little bit in the original, so I remember that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| but I don't recall the other piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| All right, so we have a motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Great to send this policy back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| It was listed as first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Is there a reason why we want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Do we want it passed early, or is that just because this is the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| Okay, there wasn't a reason to pass it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| There's nothing with the law we need to do anything like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| No, I think we were just trying to, I think the administration was just trying to update this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| and I recall what Mr. Watson is saying, you know, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| Again, I voiced the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We need to have, you know, the free speech language, you know, front and center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| But, yeah, I don't see any problem at all sending this back to review and talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| So a motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Reverend Butler to send this back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1091)|

| 0:25:04| We can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| With the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| I mean, if you're seconding it, then you can discuss the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Ms. Sela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Looking through this proposal, I have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| I don't feel like this board has been given adequate information to make this decision right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| Because what I'm looking at are some significant differences between what our employees will make and what their employees will make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1530)|
| 0:25:41| It's a $3,000 discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| And I think it's going to be very difficult to say to our employees, we did not feel that you were valuable enough to give you a $3,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1544)|
| 0:25:55| But we are willing to give that to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| So looking at that, and then noting that the staff that will be with ESS will be doing the same job as our employees, but will not be eligible for retirement benefits and other benefits like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1559)|
| 0:26:19| I'm also looking at workers' comp, and I'm wondering what differences there will be there, because I frankly have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1579)|
| 0:26:28| And then I'm looking at the 31% markup overall, and all of that is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| And I think we need additional time to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| I'm also looking at page 12 of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Right now, we are talking about, it's the price proposal page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Actually, there are a couple of price proposal pages, but it's the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| What we're looking at is just these positions at the top, but we have this huge list of positions that they've given us proposals for that no one has said we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1614)|
| 0:27:09| And so it's concerning to me that we are potentially considering this contract with this huge list of positions that we've not talked about at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1629)|
| 0:27:23| So I guess the question that I have for our staff is what kind of studies have you looked at, or what kind of empirical evidence have you looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1643)|
| 0:27:36| What data have you looked at to consider the potential attrition rate when our current loyal employees see this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1656)|
| 0:27:47| Ms. Himmelgaard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, as far as empirical studies for attrition rates on our current employees, we have not studied those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1673)|
| 0:28:04| We hope and intend that all of our current employees would stay with us and intend to continue looking for more current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| We intend to continue attempting to fill these vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Has anyone talked to any of our current employees about how they feel about working alongside people who are brand new to the position and being paid so much more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1697)|
| 0:28:27| Mr. Myers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| So have we had specific one-on-one conversations with employees around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| No, but it was clear based on the input portal and the feedback from the task force that one of the resources that is being asked for in our schools is staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1718)|
| 0:28:49| And when we have these important service providers and we don't have any applicants, our goal was to try to find some sort of avenue to get services and supports into our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1729)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you. It seems to me unreasonable to expect our current employees to stay when we are paying someone from outside to come in for $3,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1743)|
| 0:29:16| That's a significant difference in their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| And I'm just looking at classified employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| If I were an employee who had been working in a paraprofessional position for several years and you told me that no, we're not giving you any more and no, we're not raising the salary enough to bring in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1768)|
| 0:29:52| but we're going to pay a company to bring in people, I would find that incredibly degrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1792)|
| 0:30:01| I know that the custodians I talked to felt that way, and I can't imagine why our TAs wouldn't feel the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| And along those same lines, on Tuesday we were told this is very different from the custodial contract, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1810)|
| 0:30:21| I think this is actually much, much more concerning than the custodial contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Because the custodial contract, we had people coming into the schools mostly after hours, mostly when students were not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| These positions are working directly with students, working directly with students alone, and with unknown supervision from the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1833)|
| 0:30:50| The other piece that I'm looking at in all of this is when we look at the letter of recommendation that they have from Hamilton County Schools, theirs was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1850)|
| 0:31:04| It was specifically for substitute staffing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| But the concern I have here is that theirs was also specifically that the ESS team worked hard to smoothly transition our existing pool over into their employment platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1869)|
| 0:31:24| So not only were they bringing in employees, they were also transitioning Hamilton County's substitutes out of Hamilton County and into their employment platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1884)|
| 0:31:38| That's concerning to me that that is the letter of recommendation that we have, when that's not something that we've talked about at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| I think we also have to consider the strong possibility that our employees would want to leave and do that, even with a no-compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1906)|
| 0:31:58| This is all just very concerning to me, that we are putting our students in the hands of so many unknowns, but also creating a situation that absolutely has to have animosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1918)|
| 0:32:15| I can't imagine how it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I think it's an extremely poor plan, but I am willing to look at it for 30 days and determine that this is what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1939)|
| 0:32:33| But right now, looking at it, I just find it really concerning for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1953)|
| 0:32:42| Ms. Hummelgarn or Mr. Myers, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| Background checks will be handled the same way as with any other employee, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| Yes, Madam Chair. Background checks will be the same as for a regular employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I can say that I did have a conversation with an administrator in a school that struggles to staff some of these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1980)|
| 0:33:11| He reached out to me after seeing that this was on the agenda and in support of it, because there are still unfilled positions in that school and they need adults working with these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=1991)|
| 0:33:30| So I can say that I have had at least one person reach out to me saying that they felt that this was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2010)|
| 0:33:44| Ms. Spike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you. I'm sorry if I missed it. When would these positions start? When do we expect them to be filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2025)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Spike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Yes, so again, another difference between this contract and the custodial contract is we're going to have a longer runway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| There's no commitment on their end to be able to say, hey, we're going to be able to fill your 71 vacant TA positions as soon as the contract passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| They do feel strongly that they could have most of the vacancies filled prior to the winter break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| What would the difference in training be? I understand that there are job requirements, but types of training that this company might offer its employees versus trainings that we offer ours for continued trainings and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2065)|
| 0:34:42| Sure, that's a good question. So the training, particularly when we think about our educational assistants, because SLPs and our school psychs, that training is that certification piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2082)|
| 0:34:52| They're coming in to execute a specific task that aligns to what their certification is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| For educational assistants, that training would be incumbent upon us to make sure that they're equipped to work in the classroom environment that they're assigned or with the student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2098)|
| 0:35:07| if they're assigned to a particular student, so there would be that individualized piece to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| There's no upside to bringing folks in if they're not going to be able to help us execute the IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So it would be incumbent upon us to make sure that those staff were ready to work with the students in the classroom that they're assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| Will you all also be studying the positions and the success of the people hired through this company to see if there is anything different that's happening besides just positions being filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2124)|
| 0:35:46| And also studying when they're filled, how much more success we might have with IEPs being successfully drawn out and whatnot, fulfilled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2146)|
| 0:35:58| Sure, that's a pretty complex question, so let me see if I can break it into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| So yes, I think we would look more than just the fill rate, but that is our top priority coming into it because the need is pretty significant, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2167)|
| 0:36:17| In terms of our ability to deliver on IEPs, we would have the ability to look at student progress reports and things like that to potentially look and see what sort of progress we're making in terms of implementing IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2177)|
| 0:36:30| Do I think we could make a causal connection there? Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| But certainly, again, having adequate staff in place to try to serve our students seems as though it would have a net positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| Would that be something that at the end of this year that we might do another round of parent group feedback to see if we're being more successful directly due to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2202)|
| 0:36:57| Yeah, I think that as we think through the announcement on Tuesday of having that ongoing parent council and thinking about some of the tasks that that group may grapple with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2217)|
| 0:37:08| that does seem like something that could be part of that discussion given that a lot of the feedback from families and staff that were involved in the teacher input portal did relate back to that staffing resource, having people in place to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2228)|
| 0:37:25| Because I just think about what I would hate to have happen is if parents and families are not feeling that this made us more successful at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| I do think that going back to the custodian thing, a lot of the families and principals that I talked to were not happy with that, us putting the outside custodians in, and so I don't want this to go that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2253)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Obviously, I think it would be better if we had people to fill these positions. I'm sure that's what Mr. Myers and Ms. Hummelgarn would prefer also, because that would be so much simpler, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2270)|
| 0:38:04| But the problem I see is that we're a month into the school year and we have, what, 71 vacant TA positions? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2284)|
| 0:38:14| Assuming that Ms. Hummelgarn is going to approve the 11 requests that were made last week, 12, it's 12 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| Again, these are not just willy-nilly, I would like to have more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| These are staff that are being requested to help us with our inclusion initiatives and to help us increase our LRE to ensure that we have appropriate supports, not only to support students moving into that environment, but also to ensure we can support our staff to make sure they have the resources they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2309)|
| 0:38:47| That's the thing. It's not like you're just trying to lower class sizes or whatever. You're trying to meet IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| So that's the thing. I'm not sure, at the point where we are, it seems like that in the schools that the teachers and the TAs that are currently there would appreciate having more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2335)|
| 0:39:07| So I'm assuming that you would continue to try to hire regular full-time KCS employees throughout this time? Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2347)|
| 0:39:20| Madam Chair, yes. Ms. Horne, we will continue our recruitment efforts to fill all of our current vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| I just think about boots on the ground in the schools, that they need hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| As Ms. Christie asked the question about background checks, these are not going to be people that you literally bring off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| They are people who, if background checked, I would assume have some experience and they will be trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| So it seems like it would be helpful for students and teachers and parents to have additional people in the schools. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2387)|
| 0:39:57| Just to echo that, I believe we heard from some parents on Tuesday saying that they felt like IEPs weren't being implemented or implemented in a timely manner because of the lack of resources and staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2397)|
| 0:40:11| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you, Madam Chair. I think I have two questions. One is related to the markup, the 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| The statement in the contract says for all the positions that ESS provides, 22 in terms of the PDF, that ESS 31% markup is inclusive of all the district's current payroll taxes and insurance including FICA, FUTA and SUTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2420)|
| 0:40:39| The way I read that is they are saying that in place of Knox County Schools bearing the burden of those costs, that they are bearing that burden and that is what the markup is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| Is there anything in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| They will have carrying costs for those employees and that is what I am trying to ascertain. Is that what they are saying in that statement, that that is what that 30% markup is for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2456)|
| 0:41:06| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes, the markup is for the things listed within the contract, but also that there is a difference in benefits that we can offer and that they can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2466)|
| 0:41:16| That is what they have indicated that it is for as well, that $15 a day bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Say that one more time. You said there is a difference in benefits that they can offer versus that we can offer, but we are not offering these employees any benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| They are saying their benefit package is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| It is different than ours, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| My next question, I think I asked this question too when we discussed the custodial contract, is can you outline some of what the additional recruitment efforts are that we are doing outside of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2498)|
| 0:41:51| Also, Ms. Owens mentioned a non-compete. I don't know that I remember seeing that specific language in here, but would anything prevent us from offering one of these employees a job at KCS should they like the environment and they come on to our team or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2511)|
| 0:42:11| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, recruitment, I will start with the first question, recruitment efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| We are in a continuous recruitment period. We have vacancies, so we are continuing recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| Just because school has started does not mean those efforts stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| We are recruiting by all means, so by electronic means, by word of mouth, by referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| As Mr. Moseman talked about a few board meetings ago, we have a new information form, the QR code, that makes it a little easier to get connected with a person and a position versus going through the Munis application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2556)|
| 0:42:49| Have we seen some traction on that? Has the response been good and people feel like that's been a good process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| We have. It's been a very good process, and we've gotten good reviews on the shortened time that it takes for a potential employee to get connected to a person and also to a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2574)|
| 0:43:05| We also anticipate launching a new recruitment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| We also anticipate launching a new marketing recruitment initiative later this fall that we hope will continue to help fill those vacancies and get information to members of the public that are interested in joining our team and that may not know yet that they're interested in joining our team because there's pathways available for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2592)|
| 0:43:26| The second part of your question, I believe it was Mr. Moseman who asked this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2606)|
| 0:43:34| I believe that there is a non-compete in here. Let me find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| Yes, it's a non-compete per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| It talks about the LEA's obligation, which is obviously Knox County Schools and the board's obligation, and it talks about that the school system can't offer an increased rate of compensation in four-plus-year schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2628)|
| 0:44:02| So, we couldn't offer an increased compensation to entice somebody to come over, but we could offer the same compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| I'd have to dive into this thing a little bit more to kind of piece it apart, but, I mean, I think we're splitting heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| I think we're splitting heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| I think we're splitting heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| I think we're splitting heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| I'd have to dive into this thing a little bit more to kind of piece it apart, but, I mean, I think we're splitting heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| I think the spirit of the agreement is that we're not going to recruit their people and they're not going to recruit our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Now, if somebody quits one or the other, then that may be a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| So, the non-compete doesn't have a time frame on it, meaning, let's say, an employee quits easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2692)|
| 0:45:01| So, if somebody quits ESS, then we couldn't go after them for 90 days or 120 days or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| Right. Twelve months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| So, twelve months is the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| It took me a second to find it. Yes, it's section 6.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Yeah. Okay. So, thank you, Ms. Semelgar. I appreciate all the work on the pipeline and kind of making it smoother once people get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I appreciate what I'm hearing in terms of increased marketing efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| It's one thing to have a pipeline that's smooth and easy to access and get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| It's another thing to get people in the pipeline, right, which is obviously a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| It does seem like to me that, especially on TAs, can you remind us kind of what the starting rate is for a TA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2742)|
| 0:45:51| You're testing my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| I believe that it increased to an average of just over...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| Let me look it up to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| If you can find it, that would be great, but my guess is it's not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| And my point is, I do think it's something that the board needs to look at long term, because no matter how good your recruiting efforts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| marketing efforts, and no matter how smooth your pipeline is, if people say, hey, I can't take care of my family on that, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2781)|
| 0:46:31| And it's a challenge that all industries are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| I think I've made this comment before. I mean, the marketplace has shifted a lot in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And I think it's really incumbent upon us to do all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| To do other things, to add to our toolbox and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| The non-compete, I think, is concerning in that we're already saying that there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| I don't think there's anything we can do about it, but we're already saying that there's limited people who are applying for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| And if you have a pool of people who are already in this position in another company, but now they cannot come work for you, even if they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| the pool doesn't get any bigger that way for us, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| It doesn't help us in that way. It doesn't help us with our long-term problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| And I guess that's what I'm more interested in, and I appreciate, Ms. Omergarn, again, your comments about what you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| But I do think there's a financial thing that we need to look at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| And that's really the board's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| I think it's incumbent on us to kind of do the work and say, hey, we're going to make this thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| And I don't think that will solve it all, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| As a person who's been paid a wide variety in my career and tried never to be solely motivated by that, I know that salary is not everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2871)|
| 0:48:00| I mean, there's benefits and there's time off, and there's the comments I think Ms. Warren made about just having other hands to help me do my work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| It makes me want to stay somewhere, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| So there's lots of things that go into it, but at the end of the day, again, if people feel like they can't take care of their families, I mean, that's kind of like number one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| That's the first threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I did look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| I wanted to make sure I was quoting correctly after our increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Our salary increase is around $22,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| So that would be if no experience is brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| We do have our salary study, and the board has just tonight approved the extension of that, that job class study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| So we do anticipate some recommendations from the salary study as to salaries for our employees, including the educational assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| Just keep trying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| Mine did that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, Ms. Omergarn, and I've referenced many times, I think the salary study, obviously we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| $22,000 is full-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Yeah, I mean, think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| I know, just think about that, y'all, $22,000 full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| I mean, that is, you just, nobody's making that happen on $22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| And again, that's not any of our faults. I mean, it's just what's happened, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Dr. Adams, I called on you and Ms. Omergarn a long time ago. I'm sorry, I just skipped right over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| But did you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| Yes, Madam Chair, thank you, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| I do want to clarify some comments that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| I did take a poll on every, and of course it's anecdotal data, but on every principal who had services with Duncan and Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| I did see the response that their school had improved significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| Now, there were some growing pains, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| And also, I do want to also address the meeting I had with the custodian a couple weeks ago that was an hour-long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| He actually wanted to meet with me to go over a plan, and part of his plan was to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| not to only supplement, but to hire a staffing agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| And I explained to him that we don't operate like that, but not only to hire a staffing agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| he wanted to have those individuals to work during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| So even though it worked out well for that separation between our staff and their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| what he was saying is it's a team effort, and everyone pitches in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| and he wanted to explore working directly with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| What you'll hear is you'll have some faculty members or some custodians say that it worked out well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| and others will say not so well for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| However, I will tell you this, overwhelmingly, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| principals said that the cleanliness of their building, the camaraderie of their custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and the faculty and staff was greatly appreciated, and it was a huge success, with growing pains, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| But I wanted to share that, and one other thing, we did have several Duncan & Sons employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| come and work for Knox County Schools, and one was the raise that they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you very much, members of the board, and also our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| That is a huge incentive for custodians as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Well, that's some good feedback to have, and I will just say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| that kind of goes along with the conversation I had with one of my administrators this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I think things can look very differently from school to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| but if you are in one of those schools that does not have the staffing to really operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3113)|
| 0:52:03| I mean, it's tough, and they beg for this, whereas another school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| which might only have one or two positions vacant, it might be easier for people to fill those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| But some of our schools have a significant number, or more than other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| and I think that's kind of important to remember as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| Dr. Butler, we have not heard from you, I don't think, on this, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'm glad that we are having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3155)|
| 0:52:43| Honestly, when I looked at the contract and considered the need that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| I did not look at the area of how this affects existing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| So I think that is an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| And so just as we look at this, I think the need is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| The need has been expressed by the administration and staff, as well as by family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| So the need is definitely there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I do have a question, and it's been discussed, but I need clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| And I'm looking, I think, at page 22 where it says the ESS 31% markup is inclusive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3205)|
| 0:53:34| So is that saying that that 31% more includes things like benefits and taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3214)|
| 0:53:48| that we pay on behalf of the employees we have that's not included in their salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3228)|
| 0:53:57| So $22,300 is salary, but there are also other costs associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| It includes benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| $21,300 doesn't include benefits, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Madam Chair, Reverend Butler, I think this answers the question, so tell me if it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Our base salary would, for an employee, would be the base salary they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| but if they elect to take health insurance, that would come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| And there are taxes that have to be deducted, so the FICA taxes have to be deducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| There are also costs that are borne by the district that are not affecting the employee's paycheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3279)|
| 0:54:48| that KCS would pay for our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| and I understand that that's what they are referencing partially in their markup as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Since these will be employees of ESS, there are also costs associated with employment for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| But in effect, their employees will be making more money than our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| Yes, their employees will be paying, according to the contract, $143 as a daily rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| I didn't do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| What would be ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| You gave me their rate, $143 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| So what is our rate for our employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| I'm trying to compare apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| That's where they're coming up with the $128, so they're doing a $15 additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| So their daily rate is $15 a day more than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| Over the $128 that they have estimated as the daily rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| Of course, our employees can be anywhere on our salary schedule from step zero to step 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| so our employees' daily rate may look different based on their years of service with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| And then what is the $3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| Is that the $15 time, 200 days a year to get the $3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| I'm doing the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| I'm looking at it here, so I'm just making sure I'm following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| That was Ms. Owens' $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| I believe that that's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| It's written in here too, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| But it still comes down to there is a tremendous need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| And then the other piece of it is that generally when you outsource, this is a word I use, outsource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| when you're getting someone from outside to come in and do work, that's my definition of outsource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| is that it's going to cost more because you're paying a company to do some of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| than you would do in terms of recruiting workers and managing workers and checks and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| So we're going to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I think the trend has been even with the custodians, I know there's a different issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| but even with the custodian, you're going to pay more when someone comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| That's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| So we have to decide whether or not the need is so great that we have to pay more to get someone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| and that those who come in are going to make more money than the ones we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| So we have to decide whether or not, I don't know if I want to use the word fair, but is that what we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| And the other concern I think is that we're seeing this more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| In my mind I'm saying if we approve it, then the question would be what's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| What's the next time we're going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Now we're going to keep on doing this because it seems like to me we're going to be spending more and more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| to fill our vacancies unless we, because part of it is if they can get workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| we should be able to get workers except they're paying workers more than we're paying workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| So I think that long term it has to be, we have to think long term what are we going to do to pay people more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| I think that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| But at this point I think if I'm wrong, I'm trying to make it simple for me because it's a complicated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| is that we're voting need versus employee getting less, our employees getting less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3509)|
| 0:58:38| I think that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| So board members, just so you know, with the microphones, and they can only have eight on at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| so it maxes out so when your microphones are doing that, that's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| When someone turns one off, you'll be able to turn yours on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| So fun fact there, we learn something new every day about this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| And also just a reminder to those in attendance, I keep hearing noises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| and some of them are from behind me or beeping outside, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I keep asking Ms. Henderson, but I'm hearing noise out there too, which is distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| So we ask that if you do want to talk to someone next door that you step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| Ms. Owen, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Before I go to you, Mr. Dupour has been waiting to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Dr. Adams, I just want to make a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| So when KCS hired the individuals you talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| they were former employees of Duncan and Sons at the time that we hired them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| Madam Chair, members of the board, Mr. Dupour, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| They were no longer working for Duncan and Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| We did not recruit their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| They wanted to come and work for the great Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| Great, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| They heard about our great benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| When I was a teacher, I often worked in situations where we were very understaffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| where we needed additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And there are times when having additional hands is not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| When you have additional hands that are untrained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| when you have additional hands that are causing you to have to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| it becomes much more burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| And I want to be sure that everyone hears some pieces of this contract because they are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| Under the company's obligations, in selecting support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| the company shall apply such screening and evaluation criteria as it may determine in its sole discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3648)|
| 1:00:57| and as may be required by applicable state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| So, yes, they are going to do what is required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| And then maybe some other things that are mutually agreed by the LEA and the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| So what this says to me is we are going to do the bare minimum and then we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| The next is we talked about whether their employees would be trained and appropriately prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3676)|
| 1:01:25| Under the company's obligations number three, it says the company seeks to provide support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| who are trained for the requested positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| It doesn't say they are going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| It doesn't say that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| It says they are going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3697)|
| 1:01:46| Several times it notes that the company and support staff will have access to confidential student and teacher data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| including personally identifiable information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| I think that is something we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| But it is the next line that is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| The company agrees that the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| is prohibited by federal and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Yes, we agree it is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| It doesn't say they are going to do anything to ensure that that information isn't shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| It says they will not permit improper disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| But if we look a little later, we are going to see that it is not necessarily completely their obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| Under the LEA's obligation, it says to provide support staff with adequate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| training, and safety equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Provide all support staff with any training appropriate to the needs, duties, responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| knowledge unique to the LEA or otherwise different than would be generally appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| Yes, they are going to provide the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| They are going to try to find some who are trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| But it is our obligation in this contract to provide the appropriate training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| It is not theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| What I appreciate is that it says that they will not assign support staff to assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| which have sole custody of a single student for an extended period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| It does still say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I mean, they still could for a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| And then it says they will not have sole responsibility for more than one classroom of students at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3802)|
| 1:03:31| That means they could have sole responsibility for a classroom of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| So, a person who is not necessarily well trained, who is being sent to us by this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3817)|
| 1:03:47| who is not our employee, and they are going to have responsibility for an entire classroom of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| That is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| We agree, our obligation is not to assign the support staff to travel or perform duties off of normal school premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| So, this would automatically keep them from being bus aides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| So, if the position is in a special education classroom and that TA would normally ride the bus with students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| this says we cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| We cannot have them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Another of our obligations will be to maintain appropriate written internal control policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| to ensure the confidentiality of all student records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| So, that is on us, even though it is their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| And again, they say that they agree that unauthorized disclosure is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| They are not really saying that they are going to do anything to ensure that that cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3884)|
| 1:04:52| Another of our obligations is to cooperate with the company with respect to the company's recruiting efforts and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3892)|
| 1:05:01| That means promptly sharing applications for LEA positions with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| That doesn't sound like us doing our hiring and them doing their hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| because this says that we will promptly share applications for these positions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| It says we will add a link on the front page and employment page of our website to their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| and that we will reasonably assist them with advertising positions on LEA social media accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| This isn't them going out and doing all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| This is them requiring us to do a big chunk of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| This is requiring us to give them information on applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| It's requiring us to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| It's requiring us to do a big lift that we should already be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| The next thing that I hope someone has had Freddie Cox look at is it says the LEA shall cooperate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| and coordinate with the company in respect to the company's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| and installation of company's information technology systems for the LEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| The LEA understands that failure to cooperate in this regard may lead to delay in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| So they are expecting us to install their software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I hope someone has talked to Freddie about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| And last, it says that under no circumstances shall they be liable for pretty much anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| I've got three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Can we circle back to the background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| You may have said this, and I struggled to maybe find it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| as to will the same company do it and where will they be housed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| Madam Chair, Ms. Byke, yes, they will be the TBI background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| We will have the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| And it is 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4027)|
| 1:07:25| I've had completed fingerprint criminal history and child abuse background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| And then who will handle the scheduling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Will this be the principal and the school admin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Will that be us or will that be the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| And how will, like, if this person, these positions want to take a vacation day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| or some sort of something like that, how is that handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Madam Chair, Ms. Byke, taking a vacation day would be handled by ESS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| They are providing the employee for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| so there would be someone else that would be here, be in the position for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| How would that communication be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Is that outlined yet or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Not outlined yet, to my knowledge, but we would work that out with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| And then my last question about it is if we get someone in that has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| if they get someone in, if they provide someone to us that has no training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and we are doing the training, who in Knox County Schools is doing that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Is that left to the teacher to do that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And then, like, you know, we're having this conversation for, in part, special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| When will this person potentially with no experience learn what an IEP is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| I mean, again, I want to circle back to we would prefer to train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| So we would train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| So we would use our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| It would depend on the circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| It would depend on the student, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| So whether it would be that we engaged our special ed facilitators to lead that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| depending on the needs of the student, it may be OTPT that leads the training for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| But to be clear, we already train our own people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Like, if we've got to use a new vacu-track in a school, like, OTPT goes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| and trains the staff to use that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| So as we were deploying these people, we would deploy our support staff to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| that they had appropriate training, whether it was using lifts for toileting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| or using lifts to load a student onto the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Whatever the case is, we're already training people in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| so we would just train these folks alongside our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Just going back to the salary issue, I just sense people are watching with different interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| with this conversation versus the times when we've talked about this with custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| It's kind of, you know, it's the same, very same issue that we had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Like, we all want to have higher salary schedules for nutrition, for custodial, for TAs, for bookkeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| I mean, there are multiple positions that we all desire that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| and we've talked about that at other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| So since other people are now listening, I think it's that we need to just say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| that the conversation that we had when we talked about custodial is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| just like it's in this situation, it's very difficult to pick out one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| and just say we're going to raise the salaries of this classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| when we have so many others that are in the very same boat and that we do want to pay more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and that we need to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| That's very, I mean, I don't think there's anybody on this board who doesn't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| if we had the ability to do that, would raise the salaries of a huge portion of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4254)|
| 1:11:04| I just, I know every one of you all would do that, so I have no doubt in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| But the problem is that we are not the, we have no ability to raise additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| That is not within our purview to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| So we have an agreement to raise teacher salaries by 4% every year if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4277)|
| 1:11:26| which obviously we need to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| We want to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| So that leaves very little to be able to fund additional salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| So I just think we need to make sure that we're looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| We just simply cannot talk about these things and only talk about one little bit of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| because that's just, we have to look at the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| And so I'm going back to we do have the salary study that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| so that we can have a better picture of where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| But I just want everybody to, those that are watching, just to understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| that we want to be able to pay a lot of these salaries more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| We just have severe limitations in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| So I think that's just important to understand, for the public to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| that we have severe limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| And so anyway, it's an ongoing issue, and I wish that we had an easy fix for it, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4339)|
| 1:12:29| And I will just throw in, since the custodial issue came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| that my schools were very happy with the custodial help that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| because they had severe limitations in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| So I would assume that probably that I have not talked to all of them in my schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| in the special education area, but I would say that a lot of them would welcome additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| So anyway, I intend to support this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Ms. Warren, I think that was well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Mr. Myers, you made a comment on Tuesday night, and you referenced it also here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| that we're under no obligation to use this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| nor are they under any obligation to provide a specific quota of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| But I guess what I'm real curious in those, what's your intention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| So even though we're not under obligation, how do you intend to use the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| You know, we're trying to uncover every stone we can to get the resources we need in the buildings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| So to me, I just see this as another avenue to explore so that we can try to get folks where we need them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| We have a traditional, regular elementary school that is down six TAs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4427)|
| 1:13:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| So in trying to operate your building, and we can collapse, and we can make moves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| and we deploy staff to try to offset that, but six is still six when you're trying to run a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| And so my goal is I would love for us to have as many possible options as we can to try to get people into our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| And so I see this as, honestly, just another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| You know, I know Alex and his team are working hard to try to recruit talent into the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| I just see this as another tool to try to meet a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| No, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| And my assumption is if you have the contract, you would intend to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Why ask for the contract if you don't intend to use it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| So I guess what I'm, I'm not, obviously you're not going to put all your eggs in this basket, but what's your hope for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| I mean, are you hoping that this can land a 15% reduction in our, or, I mean, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| Like, to me, the we're not under no obligation is not very helpful because you're asking for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| And I'm not faulting you in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| I'm just saying, like, you want the contract for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| So what are you hoping it does in terms of reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| And I would expect you to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I'm not, I mean, like, to me, if we grant it, like, use it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| So I'm just trying to get a better sense of how do you intend to use this tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| Well, okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| So, you know, again, I think that for me the reason why the no commitment piece and those things is, again, to articulate that it is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4513)|
| 1:15:23| But, yes, I plan to use this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| And if we can fill 100% of our need with that option, then that's what I intend to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| Okay, that's helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| So you're saying if this can solve the short-term problem, then you're going to take full advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| I feel like I would be obligated to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Okay, I just want that to be clear, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Like, we're not just being asked to pass something to pass something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| It's not going to sit on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| We're going to work to get people in front of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Yeah, you're hoping that has some success, which I would, too, if we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| So, Ms. Simmelgarn, on page four, line 4.16, which is something Ms. Owen referenced earlier, I want to just let the audience know, too, sometimes our agendas are thousands of pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4553)|
| 1:16:06| So not everybody reads every line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Just want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| But, Ms. Simmelgarn, 4.16, to me, I can read that a few different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4570)|
| 1:16:19| How do you read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| And what do you think the intention is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Because if I read it as we're just, the way Ms. Owen represented it, and I'm not saying she's misrepresenting it, is that we're sharing all of our positions, we're putting them on our website, or we're putting a link to them on our website so people can directly apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4583)|
| 1:16:40| I mean, to me, that is troubling, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Because then we are competing against ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| So how do you interpret 4.16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I may lean on Mr. Dupler for interpretation of the contract, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4611)|
| 1:17:01| But we, it says, add a link to the page of the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| So that I would agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| As far as our recruitment efforts, our recruitment efforts aren't going to stop if potential employees know that there is also the contract with ESS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4630)|
| 1:17:23| Our, like Jason said, Mr. Myers said, Alex Moseman and his team have been working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| They filled 35 of our SpedEA vacancies in the last two months, decreased the vacancy number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| And that's as far as-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| I'm not going to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| I thought you were pausing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| No, go ahead if there was a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Well, you just mentioned that Mr. Moseman has filled 35, is what you said, 36?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| His team, 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Yeah, decreased the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I know he's got a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| We all got great teams with us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| So, yeah, filled 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| So, but he's not doing that and also having to have some commitment to recruit for another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| So what I guess what I'm asking is, like, if somebody lands on our website and they're like, ooh, I want to be a TA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| and they see the link for ESS and they see our link, like, to me that's how they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| And, like, to me that is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Like, it's-we have a non-compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| We're saying, hey, we can't even-if this person doesn't want to work for you, we can't even get them for 12 months after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| But then we're also putting a link on our website that says, hey, apply here for ESS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| Is that what it's going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Mr. Dupley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Helmengarn, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So that is the way it would be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| That's the way we would have to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| is that if somebody goes to the website and they-using your example, Mr. Watson-and they click on the ESS link,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4732)|
| 1:19:01| then, you know, whether that person, you know, applies directly through the LEA or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4741)|
| 1:19:10| then we would have to share, you know, that application with the ESS company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| So that would be kind of the-you know, and it could be splitting hairs at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| But, I mean, if somebody comes directly to KCS and applies for the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| then the way I read that is that person is applying for our position, our, you know, our employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| But if they heard through ESS advertising or clicking on that link, then that would be an ESS employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4774)|
| 1:19:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| And also because we're sharing our list of positions and we're doing that promptly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| then they're going to target their recruitment efforts toward our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| They're going to-I think that's why they would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Like here's the positions the LEA has, and so we're going to target our-so what we've just done is we've invited somebody in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| that's going to target recruitment at the same people that we potentially want to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| I'm like-you know, I'm the one that motioned to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Like I was down with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| That's the one problem that I have a-like I would love to see that stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| I don't think I can vote for it for that because what I'm hearing, Ms. Himmelgarn, you say many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| not just in this meeting but with others, is how much we're working super hard at recruiting efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| But to introduce competition in the recruiting efforts, that doesn't speak to Mr. Meyer's problem of filling classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| That's a whole other issue, and we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| But to also at the same time increase competition on our own website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| And to me, like that's brazen for a company to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Like for a company that says, hey, we're going to help you fill your quota, but by the way, you got to help us-like you got to market for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4855)|
| 1:21:04| Like I don't-to me that's like pushing the envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| So was there any specific conversation about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Did we ask to strike it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Did they push back and say, no way, we can't do the contract if that's still-if that's not in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| Because it almost seems to me they're saying we actually can't do the job you want us to do without you doing this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| And to me that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| It just introduces a whole other set of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| And I think you're-I think in some ways we're working against ourselves in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| So I think it will help Mr. Meyer's, and that's ultimately what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| But I think it actually hurts our long-term challenge because there's a limited pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| and we're now having to introduce competition into that recruitment pool and support that competition in that recruitment pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| So was there any-to your recollection, I don't know what parts of the contract you were involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| Was there any conversation about 4.16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Is that something that we can move to get removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I think I would have to defer to Mr. Dupler again on whether there were specific conversations with ESS on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| I'm not aware of any, and I think I'd also have to defer to Mr. Dupler on whether we could move to strike it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4932)|
| 1:22:22| I guess that's a technical question I do have is could there be a friendly amendment to approve and strike 4.16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| and see what they do with it, see if they chomp on it or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| So Scott Bolton was the one that was involved in the direct conversations with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| I reviewed it for legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| It's in much better form today than it was, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| But to your specific question on striking 4.16, the board can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| The board can strike 4.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Then it's incumbent on the company to decide if they're going to sign it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| So we can make that move, or we can defer this and then do some more negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| So, I mean, those are your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| I don't think my motion actually got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I think Ms. Owens' motion is on the floor, which is to delay 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| But assume if her motion does not pass, then I would move to approve minus 4.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5001)|
| 1:23:32| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Yes, I would want just to backtrack a little bit and agree with Ms. Owen that she explained it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5014)|
| 1:23:42| and I won't try to explain it again because she did such a fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| And we've been here before, and I think if we don't address this, we're going to be here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| I think that's the problem, is that we have a market that we have to pay more for workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| I think a lot of folks in Knoxville are familiar, you've got to pay more for houses, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| And so you've got to pay more for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| You've got to pay more for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| So in order to do that, we have to have more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| So I think that that's really the real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| What we're talking about in the sense of symptoms, we have a real problem that if we don't address it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| which category of employer, which classification would be next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| And I'm agreeing that that's where we are, but the need is so great that we feel like we have to take this action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| because, once again, it's a tourniquet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| And we found out, even with custodians, we can't leave the tourniquet on for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| and we still have the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| So I do think that some of the other issues that are brought up are concerning, but so is the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| And so I would think that, especially with what we just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| is that even in the short term, having to advertise, and this is what I'm ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5104)|
| 1:25:15| I just think in plain talk, this is a temp agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| And so when you go to a temp agency, they provide you temporary workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| Now, I understand when you go into a place, I did temp work, Procter & Gamble, Third Shift, assembly line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5125)|
| 1:25:36| They had to train me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| They trained everybody who came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| That was part of what they needed because I never worked that job, so they had to train me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| But they didn't have to ‑‑ Procter & Gamble didn't have to recruit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| The temp agency did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| And I think that's the piece that, for me, when I think in plain talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| that we signed a contract with a temp agency, they should send us the workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| We shouldn't have to get the workers, especially when they're going to pay the workers more than we'll pay ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| And the other thing is I think that, and I was going to say financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| we are paying more money for that temp agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| So we are paying more money for TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| Because it's temporary, it may be a short time, but we are paying more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| So we're really not winning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| I know the need is great, and so it's hard to say no to the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| But on the other hand, we are paying more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I worked for a temp agency, too, and they didn't train me to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| So if my concerns were just with the contract, I wouldn't suggest 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5212)|
| 1:27:01| I would just vote against it and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| My larger concern is not with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| My larger concern is that we have talked to all these people except the people who are in the jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5230)|
| 1:27:20| We have not talked to our TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| We have not talked to our special ed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| We've talked to principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| We've talked to supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| We've talked to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| We have no idea how our TAs will feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| We have no idea how our special education teachers will feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| I do because I have talked to some, and I'm confused at how what I'm hearing is very different from other stories of what people are hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5262)|
| 1:28:05| What I'm hearing from teachers is that they feel like we have a lot of supervisors of supervisors of supervisors that are taking teachers out of our classrooms when they need the people in the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5285)|
| 1:28:25| And they are concerned that they need qualified people and experienced people and not continual turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5305)|
| 1:28:38| I think it would behoove us all to take 30 days and talk to our paraprofessionals, to talk to our TAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5318)|
| 1:28:48| and to talk to our teachers in the classrooms and find out how they really feel about this instead of just sitting here and trying to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Mr. Watson, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| So we have a motion on the floor to delay for 30 days that was, it looks like, made by Ms. Owen and seconded by Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5343)|
| 1:29:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| So we will do a roll call vote on that motion, Ms. Coney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| I am voting to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| I'm voting to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Ms. Spike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| That's three yes votes and six no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I'd like to make a motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| I have to say that it fails for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| I know sometimes people slip in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| That motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| I'd like to make a motion to approve the contract minus Provision 4.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5403)|
| 1:30:12| We have a motion by Mr. Watson to approve the contract without...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| 4.16 and a seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| Is there discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Do we want to do a roll call vote, Ms. Coney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=5440)|

| 1:51:07| the name does not necessarily match perfectly the job description or the task at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| And in exploring that, at this point, we didn't want to do anything that seemed like we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| be skirting through, right, because the public would have not seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| We would have just shown up with a new, quote, new job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| So we held off on that for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6687)|
| 1:51:34| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| In the event that this passes, this position, could the name be changed internally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| Dr. Reiswit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| I think some of our discussion was really, you know, a good discussion on Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| was really about advisement and improvement, because I think that's what we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| Having that ability, as we've said before, that internal legal advisement and being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| to look for those other trends, but then also, excuse me, also improvement as far as moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| forward with some of the recommendations that Mr. Myers spoke to, as well as other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| that we want to do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| So I think those could potentially be better things forward, but to Mr. Myers' point, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| know, in transparency, we didn't want to change the name because of the 12th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| I'm also okay with the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| Actually, the words accountability and officer together, to me, are even exceptionally strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| because an officer, in any case, is there to exert some authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| I mean, that's what officers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| Officers of a court, officers of law, you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| So to me, those two words are problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| I know you don't have a recommended name tonight, and I understand your reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| I think I understand your reasoning for not suggesting one, but I would like to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I don't know if I can make a friendly amendment to, I don't want to propose a name, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| also want it to not be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| I don't know if I can make a friendly amendment to say, you know, to approve the job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| with a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| One without accountability officer, because I do think it will set the wrong tone in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| It's not what that person is there to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Is that too vague of a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Ms. Horne, I think you've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| I mean, you had seven that you wrote down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| I don't want to, like, get into that game right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Ms. Horne, I think you made the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| I did make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| What an unfortunate motion to make in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| So I guess I would like some legal counsel on this, because I don't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| Yeah, I would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| I don't know if I can make something that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Mr. Dupour, would you like to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I mean, what I would say at a minimum is that the board needs to vote on this new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| with these duties, and the board could conceivably say, hey, we're going to change this name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6859)|
| 1:54:28| you know, sometime in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| How about two motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Yeah, you could do that too, but I mean, you know, certainly, if the board's going to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| a new position and describe those duties, that much has to at least be established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| My friendly amendment would be just to strike the words accountability officer from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| title, and then they can choose whatever they want, as long as those two words aren't in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| I may have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| I don't think the board has the ability to give the titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| I mean, we might initially, but isn't that an administrative responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| Well, that's why I'm not trying to give a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| I'm trying to say, don't have this title choose whatever...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| You're trying to direct them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| What I don't want to have happen is, what I just heard, is it could be changed internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| I want to ensure that it is changed internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| That's what I'm trying to ensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Okay, so I think, what I think might be cleaner is if we, I mean, you can disagree, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| open to suggestions, but I mean, what if we just go ahead and vote on it as it is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| then have another motion that the superintendent may choose to change it, or I mean, or will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6935)|
| 1:55:45| change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Yeah, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| I think that might be, I mean, Dr. Isaac, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| I was going to say, we, I mean, again, I think we don't like the name either at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| based on discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| So, I mean, I think we would want to change it to match it more, to make it less confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| when, and I think there was good discussion on Tuesday, and I think, Dr. Butler, you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| when you were saying, is it this or this, really made us think about that as the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| happened, and we said, no, that makes sense for clarity's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| So, but again, you know, we had one day shorter between board meetings, and it could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| like slight of the hand, or trying to change whatever, and we're like, just leave it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| is and bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| But I think that would be our intent to change it to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| Dr. Reis, if you're saying your intention is to change the name, then I would approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| So, let's just stick with the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Ms. Fallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Mr. Dupler, based on our policy, can we vote for this like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| Since it says that we shall do, we shall create positions in the budget, and this very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| says that it is an unbudgeted position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| I do think there is a little bit of room for interpretation in the policy, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| say that if the board had five votes to do this, then it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7029)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| So, we have a motion by Ms. Horne, and a second by Mr. Triplett, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7043)|
| 1:57:31| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Yes, we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Thank you, Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7060)|

| 1:57:42| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7062)|

| 1:57:44| Ms. Byk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7064)|

| 1:57:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| That is eight yes votes and one no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7076)|

| 1:58:53| And do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Yes, we do have some public forum speakers on this item, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| First, we have Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7140)|
| 1:59:13| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| My name is Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| I'm a resident of Knox County and a member of the Special Education Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| I enthusiastically support and encourage passage of Vice Chair Henderson's resolution to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| Knox County Schools a model district for excellence in special education and implement the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| force's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Additionally, the other items on your agenda that address some of the issues laid out by the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| force include the student success accountability officer, or the position formerly known as, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| subcontracting for services and positions that were in items C4 and 8F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| When the task force met over the summer, we discussed a lot of things, and I want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| a few of the things that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| First, supporting your existing special education staff, especially the teachers and aides in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| classroom, is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| This can come in the form of training and professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Proper training can increase staff capacity, but also fulfilling staffing needs, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| competitive compensation and bonuses to retain and attract the very best educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| And I believe we had two of those represented on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| This also includes empowering those closest to the student to make decisions, like teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| parents and guardians, and setting the expectation within central office that their role is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| support and encourage that empowerment, take a student-first approach, and meet or exceed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7229)|
| 2:00:35| federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| And let's not forget about general education teachers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| They must be supported in their work and understand the benefits of inclusion for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| In fact, research shows that inclusive education has positive short-term and long-term effects for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| And there's not a single study that suggests inclusion with proper supports fails to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| students of all abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Reimagining Knox County Schools special education is the right thing to do, and it's the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| It's hard work, and there's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| Consider me and hundreds of other special education parents your partners in this hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| I was a lady ball swimmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| My specialty was the mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| My motto is never give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| And I somehow managed to successfully and in an uncomplicated way carry my triplets to 34 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| all while in heels and growing a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| It would be an honor and a privilege to add making Knox County Schools a model district for special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| education to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Thank you to the Board of Education for your attention to special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| Thank you to Superintendent Reiswick and Mr. Myers for taking a pause and examining how KCS can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Now let's get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| We have a second speaker on this, Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| And I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| I will butcher your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you to Miss Anderson for putting this resolution force and thank you to the board for being open to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| The resolution needs to be clear in its directive that an outside inclusion expert is imperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| A good inclusion expert will be able to address the other concerns like lawsuits and proper modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| and they will be able to guide the creation of a child first approach that takes its direction from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| closest to the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| From the website inclusiveschooling.com, it states we all have a strong need to belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| Our educational spaces need to be reimagined to create belonging for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| I would include faculty and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| All students benefit from learning environments that celebrate differences and strengths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| All students will benefit from the direction you are taking now to move our district to a model of inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| An increased sense of belonging, of connection with your peers, increases learning retention, improves mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| and leads to higher rates of success in education and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| Higher education is also embracing this philosophy as well, and big wheels and big money are turning in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7392)|
| 2:03:20| I have two children in Knox County Schools on IEPs, and both of them have been promised an aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| Both need an aid to access a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| and the staffing shortfall has a direct daily impact on our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| So I thank you for your discussion earlier on that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| My oldest child is autistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| He cannot write or type, but he is smart and wickedly funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| And a week ago, he came to the car after school with a big smile on his face, which is unusual for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| And he said, I got a 92 on my exam, but my teacher helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| I said, did she give you the answers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Did she give you hints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Did she cross out the wrong answers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| And he said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| She helped him put his notes in order for the review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| She helped him access the exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| She helped to scribe for the exam, and she helped him submit it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| And I said to him, you earned that grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| The help you got were the accommodations listed on your IEP to help you access the same test as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| And his smile returned with a tiny spark of confidence that he has not had in a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| That's what proper accommodations give our students, confidence and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| And hope is an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| And this action, this resolution right here is hope for many students and many, many families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| That concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| So we have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| I just wanted to have a little bit more discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| I promise it won't be much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| So I know we're tackling special education and all the other things and some of the stuff that I had mentioned on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| which were the RTI and the ELL and the kids who are not yet or don't qualify for an IEP or a 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7509)|
| 2:05:22| And I understand that this resolution is specifically addressing special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| which would be 504s and IEPs and those students already with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| But I hope that we can, after this, also tackle some of the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| And I know that some of the work we're doing is in accordance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| But I would like to also see that gap area be worked on because I've helped so many parents over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7542)|
| 2:05:49| who have been told that their children don't qualify for an IEP or a 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| And after I've helped them and met with them, it turned out that they did qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| And, you know, I'm not sure where the gaps were there, but that's what I think that we also really need to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7560)|
| 2:06:07| But otherwise, thank you so much for doing this work and putting this together and for the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| Ms. Henderson, I appreciate this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Any resolution that we put out can be very impactful or it could be very unimpactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7581)|
| 2:06:29| And I would challenge this board to truly and deeply hold people accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| whether they are your friends, your neighbors, your enemies, whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| If we do anything and choose not to hold people completely accountable, then we've done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7603)|
| 2:06:54| So I would like to just go one step further in addition to this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| and challenge this board and every member of this board to hold every member of our staff completely accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7620)|
| 2:07:13| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Ms. Henderson, I also want to congratulate you on this resolution and the way it was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| I think it's specific enough, but it also doesn't tie the district down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| And I think it honors the intent of what we've been discussing over these last few months and really years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| We know there's been a lot of trouble ahead of the current group that's been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| I wanted to address public comment on Tuesday, but then also even tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| So there's obviously more recommendations from the task force than what's noted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| And one that keeps coming up is an outside inclusion expert to help the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7673)|
| 2:08:00| And I always appreciate outside eyes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| Like it just helps everybody get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| I just wanted to be clear that this resolution, even though it doesn't specifically state that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| does not prevent the district from at some point choosing to do that and maybe even has it on its plans already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| So I just want to make sure that the public understands that this resolution is not the total sum of everything that may be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| over the next few weeks or few months or a couple of years in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| And to that end, Dr. Roswick, I'm not asking you to lay out like a full ten-point plan or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| But can you speak to this resolution and also the commitment you've already stated in terms of even going beyond this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7718)|
| 2:08:51| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| No, our staff agrees with the resolution, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| I think when we ask for the deep dive into that, into looking into these practices, and, again, I applaud Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| I mean, it's a tough thing when your boss comes and says, hey, we want to take a deep look into everything you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| And the whole staff that works with him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| They've been willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| It's not easy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| But at the same time, what I know by working with them every day is that they care for kids, too, and they want what's best for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7759)|
| 2:09:26| So that's been encouraging for me to see on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| So I think, yeah, definitely these resolutions do capture some of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| I think there were 45 recommendations in the full list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| So, you know, some of those line by line would be hard to put in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| But I think Mr. Myers said that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| Again, I'm glad, you know, he's a guy who holds it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| But I'm glad Tuesday night he shared a little bit of his heart and a little bit of his history of who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| And he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| I've known Jason for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| He is a reformer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| You know, he's been willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| And I think we saw that commitment from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| So, no, I do think there are more things in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I mean, I know, you know, Mr. Myers has had some next steps already planned out on including some gen ed teachers in this for some of their input, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7803)|
| 2:10:11| As I think one of our speakers said today, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| They're the ones who do a lot of the modifying and a lot of the pieces of what happens in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| We need administrators, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| As we move to be more student-centered and understanding that IEP is the interchange where a lot of that happens with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| we need to make sure that we're positioning ourselves kind of like we do with the regional structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| You know, if the school is the place where it happens, how are we designing a district around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| And I know he's already begun having those conversations with his leadership and the teams in there, too, thinking, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| Back to what we said, I think, a week or two ago, everyone's working hard, but are we doing the right work as we work hard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| So it's not to add more work or do that. It's like thinking different about the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| So I agree with you, too, and I think we've shown that, having the outside experts at times and places where we don't have that to come in and help us think through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7852)|
| 2:11:01| And that's part of what Mr. Myers is looking at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| Kudos again to the folks like Ackerman and to the educator portal and those kind of, you know, we've continued to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| We've done that with Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| I know Ms. Owen and Mr. Butler have been or Dr. Butler have been involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| And just seeing, you know, what the set of outside guys from like Catawba could do or what we saw with 865 by bringing Ford in to redesign high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7877)|
| 2:11:25| I think we learned a lot through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| And our ultimate goal is to build our capacity, right, when we bring that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| That's kind of my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| Any time someone comes in from the outside, you want it to be, you want them to work themselves out of a job as you build the capacity of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| And I think this will be the exact same thing that we'll see with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| So I think you will see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I do think there will be some things in talking with Mr. Myers even today that will happen kind of more immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| And then there will be some things, you know, as you build that out culturally that will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| And we'll need some grace in that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| I mean, when you're asking people to change some of the approach to work that they've done maybe for multiple decades, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| we'll have to ask different questions and maybe people doing that in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Or we even talked about, Jason and I were talking today about what's that impact on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| You know, if principals have been used to just making that call up any time anything gets a little shaky, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| there's going to be a learning curve on some of that for some principals too and how they handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| How do we equip them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| How do we prepare them and, you know, and give them the tools and the training and the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| So we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| I think Ms. Piper said that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| And it is going to be long work and hard work in some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| There will be some, again, with some consulting and things like that that will probably be a little quicker that you'll see coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| But our plan will be timeline-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| You know, this has seemed to work real well for our staff is to be able to put together plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| kind of have written documentation of what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Again, Region 5, we did that with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| We did that with 865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| We've done that with a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| But to bring that to the board and to the public to where we can put that on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| but it will probably take us a couple months to work through that and get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| So, again, some immediate actions will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| but long term we want to have something that's got metrics year over year of what we're trying to do to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| Thank you, Dr. Roswood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| I appreciate your approach to planning and energizing your team around specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| This is not the only one that you've done it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| I can only speak for myself, but I do want to say that I'm disappointed in myself that over the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| I have not encouraged more energy on this because this is not the first group of parents that we've heard on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8001)|
| 2:13:30| This group has gotten the most traction, and I appreciate Ms. Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| I think she was the first one that I remember speaking to us months and months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| but then all the other ladies and fathers out there and how consistent that you all have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| You all should not have to work this hard to motivate a group of decision makers like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8021)|
| 2:13:49| So I'm disappointed that I have not acted sooner on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| I'm glad that we're at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| There's also many more challenges in our district that we've been hearing from over and over and over again from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| and I hope that we would tune our ears in to those collective voices and not make people have to work so hard on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8042)|
| 2:14:11| Although I think we're going to make great strides in this area, and I'm excited to see how things continue to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8051)|
| 2:14:18| I know that there's other students and other families out there that are going to still feel like they're not getting all the shake that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8058)|
| 2:14:26| As a father of a child with special needs who's got two diagnoses, bipolar, and is on the sensory processing disorder spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8066)|
| 2:14:38| there's been lots of prayers throughout his life that he would not be seen as somebody with a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8078)|
| 2:14:46| but somebody who has unique giftings and has some unique challenges like we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8086)|
| 2:14:53| That's been kind of the ongoing prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| And the thing that I have appreciated about his education, he graduated Knox County Schools last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| is that for all but a year and a half of that time he was in a gen ed classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| and now he is living independently in Smyrna, continuing his education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| I'm fairly confident that would not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| He would not have felt like he could live in that space and do what he's doing right now, continuing his education, if he was not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8120)|
| 2:15:31| And Atlee, my son, he's an includer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| I mean he's continued to help people feel – I appreciated the comments of the mom who – I can't remember if it was tonight or on Tuesday night –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8134)|
| 2:15:44| who expressed the feelings of their classmates toward her child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| Yeah, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I mean, that's the beauty in this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| Like when we can kind of get over the differences of one another – I'm not trying to preach, I promise –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| when we can kind of get over that and we can kind of come in the same space and just like recognize the giftings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| and the opportunities that we each bring to that space and also the challenges, man, life can be so much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| And so I appreciate, Dr. Roswick, you and your team's leadership on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| I appreciate you parents and Kim Credits and all the others before you that have continued to elevate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| And I'm thankful that our board, I think, is at this point where we're going to take this step to say, hey, we codify this and this is something we want to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8182)|
| 2:16:31| And I hope we continue to do brave things in the future because we could have kept it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8191)|
| 2:16:38| I mean, you know, we could have done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| We just could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| And it takes something to step up and say we're going to do it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| So I hope we continue to do that in other spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| I just wanted to thank again the parents who were involved and the staff, Dr. Roswick, and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| You know, it took the whole community, but like Mr. Watson said, you know, I hate that it's taken this long to get to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| But I do think that this resolution captures the spirit of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| I do know there's 45 steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| So like you said, Mr. Watson, this just kind of is an overview, a broader that captures that spirit of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| And with the outside inclusion expert, that would be included in number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| That was my intent with that, just to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| And, you know, we have this resolution that I'm excited that there's so much energy behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| But this is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| And the real work begins after this resolution is passed and making sure that it's implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| and making sure that we all continue to work together to make sure that our kids are getting what they need in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8261)|
| 2:17:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| You seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| Item 9H, discussion of possible action regarding TSBA's call for resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8291)|
| 2:18:17| Do we need a motion for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Motion for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen for discussion and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| So discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| Ms. Byte?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| Since I have only been doing this year, I have been talking to TSBA a lot regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| And one of the things that I've been asking them, and they also had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| helped some in the preparation of this resolution that we passed last December, I also, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8330)|
| 2:18:58| after our last set of board meetings, asked Erin Phillips to go over it to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8338)|
| 2:19:05| and essentially there wasn't much, she said, to change, that realistically we kind of want the same things of this seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8345)|
| 2:19:17| and that what has changed in the law isn't really much of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8357)|
| 2:19:24| and that we still would like to have all of these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| So I think I had kind of requested for it to be on the agenda, but then after talking to Ms. Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8369)|
| 2:19:38| pulled that back off of there, and then in talking to TSBA, which I think Ms. Owen said Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8378)|
| 2:19:46| that they don't have any other resolutions currently that were sent to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| I asked them if we have to vote on sending it to them, and they told me no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| that we don't have to vote on sending it to them, but I guess if we want to, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| I don't know. Since it's already passed, we can just send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| They can have it. And in discussing it with me, inadvertently, they do already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| So I don't know how we want to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| My suggestion would be since, even though the deadline is September 19th, we can still send it in later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8421)|
| 2:20:30| and then their board can vote whether to put it on the agenda or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| So since they do already have it, I think it would be wise of us to get with TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8435)|
| 2:20:43| and just clarify whether they need a vote from us to send it or whether they can use it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8443)|
| 2:20:52| and then if they need a vote of the board, then we can do that in October, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| Does that work for everybody, or would everyone rather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| Ms. Horn, I know you have been on TSBA's board, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| Do you have any insight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Well, basically, if we voted for this, it would just automatically go into the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| that then all of the delegates would vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| If we don't, then their board of directors would decide at the meeting that they have prior whether to include it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8480)|
| 2:21:28| So, I mean, I assume, well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| So you can send this to TSBA, you can send this to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| However, it's dated 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| So if you wanted to, in essence, re-up this and say we still stand by this in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8507)|
| 2:21:55| then you could vote on it and then send it to TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| So that, to me, would be the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| Would it then, so would this, I'm just looking after, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8522)|
| 2:22:12| Mr. Watson, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| I was going to bring up the date as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| I think it would be more impactful if it had a fresh date on it, basically, that we would re-ratify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| Also, though, I think the vote was not whether or not they can receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| We've already voted on if they can receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| I think the vote would be to have them put it on their agenda for the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| I think that's what the vote's actually for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| But to me, so to me, there's almost two things that would, I think you might, I think we would want done if we want it sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| is one, to re-ratify it, and then also to vote to have it put on the TSBA agenda for the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| I don't know if that can be done in one motion, but I think there's two actions we're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| or I think that you're intending to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| So, Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| So, my question would be, is that then, and I guess this is maybe to Mr. Kuebler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| with this, because this is, you know, Resolution 220202, do we have to rename it or redo anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8584)|
| 2:23:12| Does it have to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| Can I add a question to that before you answer that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| So, the resolution is basically to the legislature initially, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8599)|
| 2:23:25| And their session is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| So, it's 22-23 and 23-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| That's their session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| So, wouldn't this encompass both of those years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| I mean, again, you don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| You can send this to the legislature, TSBA, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| This is a resolution that was passed by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| It's not been revoked, so it still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| So, I think to Mr. Watson's point, if you wanted to vote on it again, just specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| and say, hey, we stand by this and we want to send this to TSBA specifically, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| You don't have to, but you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| I think in doing that and having a new date re-ratifying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| I think it helps people who are seeing it understand that we've re-looked at it, that we reaffirmed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| To Ms. Owen's point, I don't think it's a have to because it's a two-year session, I mean, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| But I know that's a little bit more of a hazard because it may not get voted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| I get that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| To clarify a little bit more, what would happen then is actually it would be the TSBA membership voting on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8678)|
| 2:24:48| so then TSBA would then be sending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| It would not have our date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| It wouldn't have our name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| It wouldn't be going from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| It would be going from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230907?start=8697)|
