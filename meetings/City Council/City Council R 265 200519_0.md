| 0:10:30| nor is it in the best interest of the people living in these camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I have visited the 10 encampments around the Blackstock area twice in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=633)|

| 0:11:38| it is their responsibility to respond to and investigate reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=701)|

| 0:13:17| rather than directing them at specific city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=797)|

| 0:20:11| And I think it's a very important policy that we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| There was insistence from that police officer that he was not there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| clear the camp that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| but that he had informed the camp that he would be back the following Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| And I told him that that would violate the city's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| And he told me that was between himself and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| He didn't say his chief and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| He said it was between himself, Officer Clinton, and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| And so my conversation with the officer I found very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| And also the reports from the members of the camp of the harassment that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| have been experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Do I have evidence of that harassment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Do I have video footage of that harassment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| But it concerns me that there is no one even following up to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| whether that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| We are simply taking the word of our officers and that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| And that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I was concerned also by the follow-up email that I received from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| administration that essentially said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| KPD is authorized to be at these camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| And I did not feel like it established a policy that made it clear that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1300)|
| 0:21:50| should only be at the camps if they're investigating a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And I'm also concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| especially since complaints are not being followed up on or taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| seriously, that our primary person, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| doing our outreach in the homeless community, who's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| maintaining a map and doing these outreach events into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| is a member of our police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| And I believe that we toe the line of approaching our homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1344)|
| 0:22:36| in a way that criminalizes them when we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| rather than invest in the social workers who can do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| So I'm happy to hear about the updates regarding the dumpster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| I'm happy to hear that the outreach workers from BMC will lead that work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| making sure that those dumpsters are cleaned out and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| the occupants of the camp will help with keeping that area clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| as they told me they wanted to do if they had the resources to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| I'm glad the outreach workers are taking the lead on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| but I think that we have more work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And this situation has taught us a lot, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| And I'm just really concerned that my recount of the situation was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1409)|
| 0:23:40| believed and that the only thing that I've heard is a repetition of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| much trust there is of these officers completely dismissing anyone else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| experience at these camps, including my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So I just wanted to share that as my update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| I'm going to respond to that since you brought up some things that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| require response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| First, KPD can control any part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| They need to protect and serve every part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| including where homeless people live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Two, I need to do a better job communicating our policies to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| That's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| We've had a lot of rapid changes during this pandemic and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| communication did get sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| but it didn't get articulated clearly and repeatedly as much as it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Three, the tent encampments are temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| That is not a long-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| It's only temporary during the course of this pandemic and based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| guidance from the CDC and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| It is not a safe place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| There's crime going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| KPD needs to be there because there's been a lot of reports of assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| There's been a lot of reports of rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| And then there's been an actual murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And then there's been a lot of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| not to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| You know, lots of drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| And what appeared to me a lot of stolen property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| They need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Our unhoused residents of the city need to be protected from crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| The dumpsters and porta potties are going to be managed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I hope that they're used in a safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| If there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| if they pose a difficulty and it becomes less safe to have those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| And not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| And we'll have to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Plan C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| So also just to say that the dumpster is already there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| And I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| I hope it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Make it a little cleaner environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| During this temporary conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Any other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| I just like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| To add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| There are often many levels of things going on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| I know that officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Is trusted by a lot of members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| At the camp that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| There were other encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| And has been working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| There's a woman who's been living in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| And the only person she felt comfortable talking to about it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| And so that's one of the reasons that he comes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So there are a lot of things going on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| There are a lot of levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| It gets complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| But I know that he's been helpful in a lot of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| And I also wanted to just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| My report back that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Was about the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Who was with officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Who was mocking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| But there has been no conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| There's only a focus on how good officer Clinton is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| About that focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Whether people, you know, I didn't say officer Clinton is the one harassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| The homeless community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| But until we investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| So I just wanted to reemphasize also, yes, there has been a murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| We also have victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Who witnessed, who are dealing with this, who were friends of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| So responding to a community that's dealing with higher rates of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Is not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| It's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| It's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=1658)|

| 0:33:26| It's not the budget. I hope to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| but it maintains the city's commitment to my four core priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2011)|

| 0:33:33| Clean and resilient future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And thriving businesses and good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| This pandemic has meant that our budget is tighter and more austere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| than in recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And I do expect that we will have to consider budget amendments more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2031)|

| 0:33:56| This pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| We are hopeful that we recover quickly and I'm confident that we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| but it's just impossible to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Maybe coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Depending on the revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| I also want to address explicitly a lot of discussion about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| strategic planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2060)|

| 0:34:31| champion for significant investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2071)|

| 0:34:47| Harriet Tubman park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2087)|

| 0:34:52| in the city of McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2092)|

| 0:34:56| strategic planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And the Burlington enhancement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| When viewed in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| these projects total hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| And probably reflect the largest investment in these areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| In decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And these, these were all investments that were in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| Before I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I would like to quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2115)|

| 0:35:44| I would like to reiterate my commitment to the sixth district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2144)|

| 0:35:54| my deputy director of economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I specifically remain committed to showing tangible movement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2159)|

| 0:36:05| I just wanted to mention that as a preface to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| The motion has been made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| I wanted to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| I'm new as mayor and we have some new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| What can you just give us a brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Overview over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| What council can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| We discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Counsel's role with regard to adopting the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Is set forth in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| And is specifically at section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| The fifth day before the ensuing fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| It says that the council is obligated to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Finalize the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| By the 15th day before the ensuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Fiscal year. So that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| Approximately June the 15th budget has to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| The charter goes on to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| And 901 F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| That adoption shall take the form of an ordinance setting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| making appropriations according to fund and by organizational unit purpose or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| activity as set out in the budget document. And so the charter does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| provide for line item authorization or line item adjustment, line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| modification by council. That is an issue that has come up many times in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| There is a formal law director's opinion from June the 10th of 1982, opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2255)|
| 0:37:45| number 82-7A, in which the question was posed, does council have any authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| make line item modifications to the budget during the budgeting process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| The opinion of the law director at that time, that was John Roach was the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| and the opinion was that the Council of the City of Knoxville is required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| make appropriation by organizational unit purpose or activity and may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| amend the budget by deleting or amending specific line items. The conclusion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| that opinion is instructive and it goes on to say that because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| requirements that the appropriations be made by organizational unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| purpose or activity that the mayor and directors may transfer appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| within departments by their actions alone and because the mayor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| responsible only to the people for the proper administration of the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| office, it is the conclusion that the council may not amend by deleting line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| items but may amend only by amending the total appropriation for organizational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| units, purposes, or activities. That was the opinion in 1982. For about a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| of a century following that, I was City Council's attorney. It has been followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| without exception since that time. It has been followed since I have also been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| law director now for the last eight and a half years. So and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| actually good law based on what the charter says. So there is no authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| for council to make line item modifications to the budget. What you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| do is you can make modifications to the various departments. You can change what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| the bottom line is with regard to those departments. But other than that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| this is a strong mayor form of government under our charter, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| mayor is authorized to direct how the funds that you appropriate for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| various departments, funds, or organizational units may be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| Mayor, we we do have several persons signed up to speak to this item. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| know if council wants to hear from them before council gets further in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| deliberations. Council members, do you want to hear from speakers or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| want to clarify some questions with Mr Swanson? I had some clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| questions. Okay, Miss Parker, I have some amendments that I wanted us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| discuss, but currently we have a motion to approve on the table. Um, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| one reason I wanted to make the motion to postpone so that I could, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| discuss my reasoning for wanting to make that postponement. And then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| could continue the discussion of what our various amendments might be, uh, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| preparation for, uh, our city council meeting next, uh, our next city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| meeting. Um, and if we did, um, uh, make those amendments and bring forward a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2464)|
| 0:41:12| new amended ordinance, uh, I believe we'd have to pass it on an emergency in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| order to meet that June 15th deadline. But it would least give us another two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| weeks, um, to determine whether, uh, these amendments could even be made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| So Councilwoman Parker, do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I would like to make a motion to postpone. I didn't know if I could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| that with the motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Yeah, the motion to postpone is a priority motion and must be taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| first. Okay, so there's a motion from Councilwoman Parker to postpone. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Okay. Seeing no second, the motion to postpone fails for lack of a second. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| we're back to the original motion. I would suggest that we hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| public who signed up to speak if that's okay, and then we can come back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Council discussion. What do you think, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Is that okay? Okay, Mr Johnson, we have several people signed up to speak. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| not sure what the order is in which they signed up. So, uh, I mean, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| see I do have the list. I could start with Mr Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| Uh, I don't know. Yeah, no, you're fine. The first person we have is Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Brown. We do have not 10 people signed up to speak to this item. That is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| excess of what Council rules normally allow. So Council rules normally allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| 34 and three against. Is that right? That's correct, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| Council members. We have more than six people, and I'm not sure about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| foreign against. Do you want to stick to the first six who signed up or 343| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| against in the order in which they signed up or suspend your rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| listen to everyone who signed up? I would feel comfortable with three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| minutes each to listen to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| Anyone else have comments? And I mean, we can vote on it to alter your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| It's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| It wasn't. I think lined up a shortened amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| I think Miss Sings Councilwoman Sings proposal is fair. Okay, so Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| saying you make a you're making a motion to allow all the rules and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| all speakers who signed up to speak for up to three minutes a piece, right? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Councilman Ryder seconded that. Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote on this motion to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| for public forum for this agenda item just tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| Councilman Singh. Yes, Councilman Smith. Yes, Councilman Testament. Yes, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2633)|

| 0:44:13| Yes, Councilman Ryder. Yes, Councilman Roberto. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| Okay, the motion to change the rules passes 90. Let's start with the with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2660)|
| 0:44:30| public forum. Yes, ma'am. Our first tell me which page we're beginning with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| one with Chris Martin at the top. He's not speaking to this item, but he's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| first person. Okay, so we're this. So we'll start with Clifford Honick. Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| no, Michelle Brown. Michelle Brown. Yes, ma'am. Miss Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| Are you on the call? I am. Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity. I spoke last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| weekend. Just wanted to come back briefly. Miss Brown, if you could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| us your name and address, please. That's right. Sure. Michelle Brown. 44 7 Dogwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Lane, Knoxville 37919. So I'm here again as someone who appreciates all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| the hard work and efforts that this council in the mirror doing. I hear you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| agonistically trying to think through these things together. I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| work. I'm a criminologist at UT. I'm here to speak about the budget that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| hope for, if not now in the future, which is one that I think will consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| innovative ways of supporting the kinds of public public safety efforts that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| just heard American Canon and council member Parker discussing. So part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| what I wanted to speak to, having mentioned last week a lot of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| know in terms of infrastructural needs around public safety, I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| reiterate this week that there's lots of ways to do that, that lots of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| budgets are doing that. I wanted to point briefly to some of how that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| playing out. So we know that the police are given undue burden in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| they have to deal with, you just described it, and that that burden in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| fact relates to all sorts of things, not just crime. It relates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| infrastructure of our city, it relates to housing, it relates to every healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| education, everything that we deal with. So part of what I wanted to show you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| how some communities are in fact trying to address this. So I have worked with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| program that started in 2011 in Seattle and is now in over half the states in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| the U.S. It's a law enforcement assisted diversion program. It's believed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| the first pre-booking diversion program in the U.S. that deals specifically with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| low-level drug and prostitution charges as well as issues related to mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| health and homelessness. It's the kind of program that specifically attempts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| divert these folks into intensive community-based social services that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| guided by a public harm and harm reduction model. So what that means and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| what it looks like specifically is that in an arrest referral, a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| makes an arrest, brings the arrestee to the precinct, it would contact a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| manager who's trained in this program, who then goes and takes over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| particular case. It does in fact mean that caseworkers provide an intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| plan and and develop a process of referral to particular kinds of agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| They work carefully around issues of housing, treatment, education, job training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| job placement, transportation, child care, all the things. And they do that in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| in which the custody is relinquished to the caseworker and if they do this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| the course of 30 days at intake, the charges are dropped. What we know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| this program and what we know about it from the time it was developed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Seattle, I actually worked with one of the criminologists who helped develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| the program. These folks were 58% less likely to be arrested than they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| were if they'd had ordinary contact with the criminal justice system. I'm dreaming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| of a public budget that sees public safety as also involving a broad range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| of social service workers and also a racial disparity project. We need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| tool in this. We can do it and we can do it together across the coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Is the next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Mr. Matavu? Is that right, Mr. Johnson? I'm just going on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| Matavu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Matavu. Okay, Zimbabwe, Matavu, you're next. Please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2913)|

| 0:48:52| I want to speak to the budget as it pertains to the administration of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| city of Knoxville and having a shifting of some of the funds for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2939)|
| 0:49:09| administrative purposes to a department designed specifically to implement the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2949)|
| 0:49:20| disparity study that is a result of a Title VI effort that's taken place over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| two decades in the city of Knoxville. When we speak of healthy neighborhoods, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2971)|
| 0:49:41| must concede that I think most neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| are healthy ones. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| the areas that 80% of African Americans reside in, 37915, 37914, 37921, are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=2991)|
| 0:50:03| most unhealthy areas in the county. And in order for that to be reversed, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3003)|
| 0:50:14| has to be a comprehensive effort on the part of the city of Knoxville to reverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| it. And the vehicle we maintain that is essential in doing that is a Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3021)|
| 0:50:33| office established and elevated. Let me say a Title VI office reestablished and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3033)|
| 0:50:43| elevated to cabinet level, with the director reporting directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3043)|
| 0:50:54| mayor. I think that in and of itself will give the office the kind of cachet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3054)|
| 0:51:06| will make people understand that the city of Knoxville is serious about its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| most serious neighborhood condition. Half a minute left. And with that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3071)|

| 0:52:00| Okay. Mr. Andrews, you're next up to speak. Please start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| and address for the record. And you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Kevin Andrews, 107 Edinburgh Lane. Thank you for allowing me some time to speak. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3129)|
| 0:52:20| had a chance to look over the proposed budget. And I have to say, it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| infuriating, some of the things that were overlooked in creating it. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| here to urge you to revise, to revisit the budget and rebuild it into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| people's budget that puts the hardworking people of Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| their futures first. There were many things overlooked, I feel, but I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| zero in on one aspect specifically, sustainability. Knoxville is a city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| cares deeply about the environment. And it's time that our budget reflected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| I look at this budget, and I see millions going to private enterprises to gentrify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| low income neighborhoods. But I don't see any money going to help the residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| those same neighborhoods weatherize their homes to be easier on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| budgets and on the environment. I see millions more going to an already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| overresourced police department, instead of things like expanding and updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| our meager public transit. And there's so many other places that need funding. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| many other things that this budget fails to even mention. Where's the mention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| the ongoing climate emergency? Where are the sustainability requirements for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| developers receiving these funds? And where are the funds for things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| green infrastructure, improving walkability and bike safety, basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| things for creating an equitable, sustainable community? And how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| create that community without these funds, the funds that are being given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| the already rich and powerful? Knoxville as it stands, despite caring about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| environment is not a sustainable or equitable city. It very much has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| potential to be, but it's not. And that's a problem. And this budget fails to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| the most basic things to address that problem. So I'm begging you, please revise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| this budget for the sake of this community and its future. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Mr. Andrews. Next is Lisa East. Miss East, if you can start by saying your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| and address for the record and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3283)|

| 0:54:57| Miss East, are you on the call? She is, ma'am. One moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3297)|
| 0:55:08| Okay, I'm unmuted. Thank you so much. Yes, my name is Lisa East. I live on Gertrude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| Avenue in South Knoxville in the Old Stabier community. So I echo many of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| concerns of other speakers tonight, but I am in particular concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| neighborhood investment and disinvestment in the proposed budget. I'm speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| tonight to encourage council, but as we just heard from the law director that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| also need to be really talking to the Mayor's administration too, the American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| I'm also encouraging you to either amend this budget, particularly to rectify some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| of the inequities that are found in the budget as it stands with investment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| disinvestment in communities. So living in the Old Stabier community on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| south side of town has been difficult for the past few years. While others see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| the city, in the city probably see this as a neighborhood that's flourishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| because of what is assumed to be positive development and investment. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| neighbors and I are experiencing the firsthand impacts of gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Gentrification is really a term that's overused a lot in our public discourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| which sometimes makes it lose its saliency. But what it really looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| and what I can tell you firsthand from is that communities like mine, it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| like rate rising and unaffordable rents, and a historically working class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| community, the displacement of long standing families and the disruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| really of our lives with little community input on what we would like our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| neighborhood to become. The current budget has three items that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| allocated that will significantly impact Old Stabier. A million dollars for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| severe avenue development, a million dollars for waterfront drive and $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| for a study on residential parking permit business plan assessment. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| plans for development on severe avenue and waterfront drive both earmarked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| a million dollars are troubling given the impact that we've already felt from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| this rapid development. I don't mean this to be a not in my backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| argument. There have been positive impacts from development in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| neighborhood and there are needs for our neighborhood and severe avenue as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| well. Sidewalks are particularly an issue as a young parent that has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| maneuver a stroller. It's pretty difficult sometimes when you get caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| in the hole. However, given how contentious development in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| neighborhood has been for the past few years, the recent issue that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| dealing with, with proposed development of condos near waterfront is really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| the tip of the iceberg of these issues. And how many of my neighbors neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| have had to move because of rising rent costs. I really hope that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| and the mayor's office will work to understand the unique challenges that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| we're facing instead of moving forward to earmark this over $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| development plan that may leave many of us out and behind. Concerning parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| and this particular business plan assessment, that's also really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| troubling at $50,000. Given that what we know is if paid parking moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| forward on severe avenue, this would shift even more parking of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| are patrons of the businesses on severe to our neighborhoods blocking our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| driveways, which they already do when the nightlife is really popping. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| other neighborhoods are really starving for development funds, like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Burlington community that has been mentioned, and East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| communities. So I really think that we could think creatively about where to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| allocate this money and these development plans. If you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| pass this budget, please make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3521)|

| 0:59:19| development and gentrification. Period. Um, addition to the fact, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| just found out that in the last budget vote, we spent $7 million on what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| supposed to be known as the Magnolia Corridor. Uh, very disappointing to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| that out. This is a prime example of what we're talking about when we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| poor budgeting. So also find out on top of that, that you all went and did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3575)|

| 1:00:50| do or do not want in our community. This form of government that we have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| dysfunctional. It does not work, and it constantly keeps getting heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3654)|

| 1:01:22| It's not people-supportive. It's not people-protective. All it does is take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=3682)|

| 1:13:53| in the Burlington neighborhood, is going. It's flatlined. It doesn't breathe. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| doesn't have a pulse in Burlington. After a certain time at night, there is no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| for you to eat out, you know, out food or fast food or even get anything healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4443)|

| 1:16:21| about a little over $7,000. This isn't even 2% of the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| preservation budget. And while historic preservation is important, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| it's also important to realize that energy justice is housing justice, is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4591)|

| 1:17:00| In addition, we know that KUB's fixed fee structure, where they charge unusually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| high fixed fees, keeps people from being able to lower their bills. And we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| that existing programs for weatherization and cutting your bills are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| insufficient. I ask that this budget be amended to establish programs that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| accessible and accessible to low income folks for heating their houses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4641)|

| 1:17:32| live in houses in need of weatherization. And I would like the council to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| to work with the Knoxville Utility Board in establishing programs that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| accessible to renters in a majority renter city and that don't require loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| that may not be qualified for the lowest income workers. Finally, I'm happy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| the budget supports affordable rental housing. However, keeping the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| rental housing number at the same $2.5 million is just not enough to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| scale of the problem in Knoxville. In addition to the statistics, I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4686)|

| 1:18:15| shows that rents are rising over five times faster than incomes in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| and over one third of Knoxville households are paying more than they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| afford for housing. We're currently in a crisis moment, and the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| allocated to the affordable rental housing should show that. I am happy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| the home grant fund did show an increase over the last year because of new state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| appropriations, and thank you for working on that. Finally, I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| say so many conversations I have with people my age and younger involve worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| about housing. I know so many talented young people who have left this city due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| to housing costs, and I know that Knoxville is better when we can retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| people, people can remain in the neighborhoods where they grew up, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| they feel they have the housing security to start businesses and pursue career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| risks. So I ask that you are able to amend the budget to add those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hughes. Mr. Johnson, as far as I can tell, that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4753)|

| 1:19:24| Okay, council members, that concludes the public speakers on this item. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| motion on the floor to approve, and it's been seconded. Go ahead and discuss, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| we can answer any questions. I appreciate your votes for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| budget. As I mentioned before, it's not the budget any of us wanted, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| given the pandemic, it's a fiscally responsible budget that tries to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| responsive to the community's needs. So I thank you for your discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| support. Any questions or comments? I'd like to make a proposal that we amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4796)|
| 1:20:06| the budget to address some of the community needs that were just brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| up. Yeah. Are you, is that your motion, or are you like about to say it? Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4810)|
| 1:20:26| didn't know if we were still in discussion where we can just discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| amendments, or if I need to make a motion to amend. I think we're in discussion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| that's also the same time to offer amendments. So if you're gonna offer an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| amendment, I think this would be an appropriate time, but I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| it'll be in order. I'll have to ask it once I hear it. I don't know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| amendment's gonna be. Well, I'll just go ahead and make a motion that we amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| ordinance, so to address the concerns just shared by the community. And I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4857)|
| 1:21:08| little bit of information that I wanted to share to introduce the motion. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| let's, let me first ask the law director, can you just tell us if that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| motion to amend, is a proper motion? Because it doesn't specifically suggest any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4879)|
| 1:21:27| amendment to the particular matter that's before the council. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| suggest any adjustment to any of the areas that are permitted for adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| so it is not a proper motion. Okay, you want to try a different motion, or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4898)|
| 1:21:46| want to have the discussion with the first and then come back to it? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| let's just have a discussion, and perhaps the law director can tell us whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| whether we can make this into a motion as a city council. But according to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| I heard the law director say, we can make amendments within units, and nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4927)|
| 1:22:17| Nope. You can, you can make amendments within various departments. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| delete some amount of money from a department. You can add money to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| department if you delete money from a different department to do that, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| cannot specifically, in a line-item way, say what those funds are to be utilized for. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| simply change it from department to department. With regard to capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| projects, your only capability there would be to delete certain amounts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| money from the capital budget, but you couldn't say what it could be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| And we can't recommend adding money to the capital budget, or moving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4975)|

| 1:23:05| that money is going to come from. What if it's from within the budget, within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| capital budget? You can't recommend moving it from one place in the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| budget to another place in the capital budget. You can simply bottom line the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| capital budget. Gotcha. Okay, well, for our discussion, I would strongly urge the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5001)|
| 1:23:30| administration, since I cannot make a motion on the capital budget, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| strongly urge the administration to adjust the amount budgeted, and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| that's bringing that back to us in June, which I would love the council's support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| on that, or whether that's a future budget amendment. But I would strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| urge the administration to adjust our capital plan to reflect a more equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5036)|

| 1:24:53| prioritized in the budget. Meanwhile, we have projects in the budget that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| only been discussed in the last few years. And also we have projects in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| budget that have had no public input process, that are receiving a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| amount of dollars before those public processes have even taken place. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| would urge the administration to recommit money to Burlington so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| those processes that have already gone through a public process can move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| forward, while these other projects receive the public scrutiny that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker. I hear what you're saying. Anyone else have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| comment or discussion item or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| Well, I also have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Um, so I can't deal with the capital budget. But I wanted to speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| other concerns lifted up by the community and see if we could make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| the budget for certain departments and apply those amendments to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| departments. Um, so and I'm this is not a motion. I'm just this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| discussion before I make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| And, um, so those adjustments that I'm recommending are that, um, we increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5184)|
| 1:26:36| the staff support for park so that we can, uh, have an investigator, uh, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5196)|
| 1:26:46| additional investigator in addition to the executive director in part to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| serve our community. Um, and I'm also recommending that we add staffing to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| title six office. Um, and the reasoning behind that, in addition to what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| public speaker said, there's been 20 years of work put in to try to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| the title six office that we need in this city. Um, but timing wise, uh, as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| city, why don't we? Why don't we just see about this motion? I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| finished making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| You're making a motion about park and another motion about title six. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| right? Or is it one combined motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| Right. It's gonna be a combined motion to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Are there, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| And this is the discussion part before the motion is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| Well, then let, uh, okay. So you're not making a motion. You're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Okay. So, um, we need increased staffing for park. We also need increased staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| for our title six office. Um, and this was, uh, made even more clear after our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5291)|
| 1:28:20| budget hearings, uh, because there was a, uh, just, you know, there was a, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5300)|
| 1:28:28| reference to a program in Memphis, uh, the 800 initiative. Um, and so over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| weekend, I looked into that program, uh, into that initiative and thought, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| this is something that we, uh, could do in Knoxville. Um, but if we are serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| about doing a program like that, we need, um, a space where that work is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| be coordinated, uh, where it is staffed, um, essentially that project in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| others haven't had a chance to look into it. Uh, it addresses, um, uh, the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| uh, to strengthen, um, our, uh, uh, minority business sector and makes, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| specific plans for strengthening black owned businesses, uh, based on, uh, long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| held disparities, um, and their city and disparities that, that we also, uh, hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| here. And so, uh, my motion speaks to both of those needs. Um, and my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5368)|
| 1:29:38| that I'm about to make, uh, also speaks to, yeah, not there yet. Uh, emotion also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| speaks to, uh, the statistics that our community, you know, has continued to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| share with us that, uh, we do have a high poverty rate throughout our city, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| particularly in our black community. And we need to make, uh, addressing that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| priority in this budget, uh, even during a pandemic. And I would argue, uh, most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| especially, uh, during the pandemic. So I hope that you will support my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| Councilman Parker, Councilwoman Parker, excuse me. Can I just make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| before you make your motion? Yes. Okay. So, um, myself and Brandon Bruce gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| a lot of folks around the 800 initiative and were the ones that brought it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| mayor's attention. And so, um, it is a problem, black poverty in our, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| Knox County is, as you know, is the worst in the state budget aside. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| work with you, um, hand in hand to lead the charge on that. Um, regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| this importance. So, um, just echo your comments on that. It is a problem. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| are ways to address that on replicate that program here that don't require a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| budget amendment. But that is, uh, I'm happy to join you in that. It is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| issue. I agree with you. We should fund it. And, um, I think there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| ways through departmental funds and supplemental funds that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| So regardless of this amendment, I'll join you in that. And what departmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| funds are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| With the community development budgets, there are a number of sources for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| There are federal and state grants that are available for similar initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| So, um, I'm not saying that I have a dollar amount for replicating that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| Knoxville, but we can start it and I feel confident we can achieve, uh, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| things with existing budget. So are you suggesting that the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| would coordinate that work with you and I leading it? I'm suggesting that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| community, uh, participate in it. The administration. I think Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| has mentioned she's supportive of a similar program. There are. The good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| thing about that program is that it reinforces existing programs in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| community and provides funding and people resources to that. So we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| start it and make progress regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| So to add on to that, um, the particular part of the program that I find, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5550)|
| 1:32:38| intriguing is, uh, tying it to a title six program where you are setting, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5558)|
| 1:32:48| setting targets each year and you need, uh, someone in the administration who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| tracking it, uh, and who's holding, uh, not only who's not only servicing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| community and our business community towards those efforts, but who's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| to hold our own departments accountable and in aligned with targets set that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| also impact our city contracting. So I do think that community piece is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| important piece. But as far as I see it, it's a, it's an additional, uh, piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| workload that only, uh, shows us that we need more staff capacity committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5608)|
| 1:33:36| this. It's not something the community can do on its own. We're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| those targets. Sure. There are a lot of aspects to it. Um, we'll go into all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| details of the program here and how we solve it here for Knoxville. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| sharing my commitment to with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| And, uh, let me, uh, council member Parker and Smith. Let me also share my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| commitment to the 800 program as well. I do think that there are some, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| community partners that we can engage with as well. And this is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| I think as we look at grants and additional funding, uh, once we go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| into the program, uh, budget amendments, I think would be, uh, some would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| appropriate, but I think we need to get into it and see what that's the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and depth of that would be. I don't know if the urban league could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| play a part in assisting with this, but I do share that commitment to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Okay. So, um, uh, I think that looking for funding is fabulous. My proposal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5671)|
| 1:34:41| that we already have unfilled positions in our budget and that during a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| during a year where we're experiencing a budget crisis, um, we cannot just hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| uh, positions empty within our budget. When we have other urgent needs, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| that we could use those positions towards, um, the positions that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| referring to are the human resources positions, uh, that were previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| budgeted, uh, but cannot be hired because they have not been created by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| ordinance and also, um, positions that have not been created by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| And also, um, positions within our police department that are unfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| Um, my understanding is that KPD has 502 positions filled. They're authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5728)|
| 1:35:36| for 530. Uh, they have another class coming up this fall of 20 recruits, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| to add. Um, but what I'm asking for is only two of those positions. Um, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| could reallocate two of those empty positions, uh, that would give, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| would allow KPD to, uh, follow through on, uh, their recruitment schedule, add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| in the 20 recruits. Um, and also, uh, I wanted to update, I reached, reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| out to finance to see, uh, what does KPD's budget look like at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| the year? Are they underspending, uh, because of these, uh, vacant positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| And I learned that they're not underspending their budget. Uh, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| using, uh, their entire budget plus, uh, uh, extra each year, uh, to fund over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5785)|
| 1:36:33| time, uh, for their officers. But the good news is that, uh, this year, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| we're expecting their, them to spend, overspend about $26,500, uh, in, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| their budget. And that comes back to us in these home, uh, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| housekeeping ordinances where we balance the budget as a city council. Um, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| the good news is, uh, three years ago, that overspending was as high as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| $400,000. And so my proposal is that, uh, even if we reallocate these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| positions, uh, to other parts of the budget that are in need, uh, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| ensure KPD is able to, uh, have the budget they need, uh, by them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5838)|
| 1:37:25| continuing the practice of spending what they need. Uh, and then we, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| we'll rectify that during our housekeeping procedures in October. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| but this allows us to move forward with providing much needed capacity in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| areas. That's going to allow us to address, uh, long-term health equities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| in our city, uh, at a very serious level. And I'll stop this councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Councilwoman Fugate has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| Mr. Hugo. Um, I just have a question. Um, and it's for one of our attorneys. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| do not disagree with all the things that you're talking about. I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| figure out what our authority is. I assume our authority is we could agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| to move money from one department to another, but we cannot tell the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| who she has to hide. Is that correct? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| Right. That's my only concern about this is that we can move money, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| cannot tell the administration what positions they have to have are. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| that's my concern was starting to move money around at this point in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| Thank you, Mr. Get any other questions about this amendment that it's about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| Mr Thomas. Yes. Just to come in. I share Councilperson Parker's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| about Burlington. I've thought it's been untapped potential for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| time. Part of it is I used to frequent it a long time back when there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| some life there. There was a coffee shop. There was a record store. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| infrastructure is there, and I think the need for attention there is is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| based. I think at this stage in this particular budget proceeding, as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| come to find out, it's gonna be a pretty daunting task. But that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| mean it's not too early to start thinking about the next budget and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| laying plans for Burlington about how that money might be allocated. So any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| vote I have today is not a redirection of my concern for Burlington. I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| much a supporter, but I'm afraid I'd be better served to start thinking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| terms of the next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you, Mr Thomas. I just like to comment on that is just, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| know Council members probably are aware of this, but maybe people listening or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| not. There is currently an allocated amount of $587,000 to work on Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6002)|
| 1:40:10| in the capital budget that has rolled over from from this year and will roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| over into the next year. So if you approve a proposed budget, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| mean $600,000 up a little over that. Correct me if I'm wrong, voice Evans or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| David Grace. I believe it would be a little over $600,000 available to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| and I'm committed to continuing the work on Burlington, and that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| enough money to do like a huge investment. But it's not pocket change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| either, and I want to make sure that we talk to the community and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| that we do work with the council and Vice Mayor McKenzie, who represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| that community to continue to build on the investments and make sure it's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| the community wants. And that I think we have time this year to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| input from the community and then to come up with construction documents to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| move forward with a plan. And then if the economy is in a better place a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| from now, we'd be able to fund those improvements. But $600,000 to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| input and come up with a plan, I think that shows some pretty good commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| And you have me on the record here right now saying that I am asking my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| administration, not asking, directing them to work on this and make it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| priority. And I hear the community, I hear Vice Mayor McKenzie, I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Councilwoman Parker, I hear all of you saying that this is a priority, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| share that priority. And I think $600,000 is a healthy amount to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| forward on the planning for this initiative. Just to clarify that as mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| or maybe one of the deputies, the next step for Burlington is not construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| it's a infrastructure plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| Mr. Brace, could you speak to that? Or voice, Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| Yeah, this is David Brace, COO. Thank you, Councilman Smith and Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| Parker. So if you look at the East Tennessee Community Design Center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| their enhancements plan that receives significant public support and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| input, it's a very good document at the very conceptual level. And so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| next step for that would be to engage the community and look at what specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| infrastructure items are priorities for the community, residents, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| owners, business owners, and others. And once those priorities have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| decided, then the city engineering department and probably a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| professional consultant could step in and actually work on the design aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| which would take, again, six months. Steve King is on as acting engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| director. But again, there's a probably a six to eight month window of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| construction document development. And then we would be ready to actually go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| to the market with funding to complete the infrastructure work. And if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| at the enhancements plan, it called for pedestrian scale lighting, improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| crosswalks, sidewalks, and other really streetscape style infrastructure work. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| guess is is some facade grant dollars would also go a long way. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| already done some had some benefit in Burlington. So but again, that 600,000, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| think would get us to where we have construction documents, the planning, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| construction documents, and probably some funding for infrastructure work. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| we would need to, again, bolster that to complete it long term. But that will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| some time. And ma'am, just to answer you answer your question. Yeah, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| balance of 587k. You add that 25k to it from the proposed budget now, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6246)|
| 1:44:15| to give you a 612k and some change going forward into FY 21. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| into that 600,000 is sufficient for the next phase of Burlington. Yeah, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6262)|
| 1:44:29| haven't I think it is it for the next phase, which is priority and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| construction documents. Once we know the priorities, then we will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| additional dollars to do the actual completion of the full infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| that and I don't have an estimate for that. It depends on how much of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| enhancement plan we you know, the community and the city can can agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| upon. So but it can get us the first step. I mean, if you know, if Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| handed $5 million to Burlington, we still need to do prioritization, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| need to do construction documents, and we need to do right away acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| all of those infrastructure projects take significant time. As you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| with severe Jackson Avenue ramps, Magnolia streetscapes, that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| takes significant time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| yeah, let me let me also add that there's been a significant community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| involvement over the last few years as relates to Burlington and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| redevelopment of Burlington, which started with the Isle of Burlington, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| group that did was comprised of business owners in Burlington, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| do still have businesses that are coming into Burlington, maybe not into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| the just on the outskirts of what we want, what we're referring to as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| old Burlington Business District. And there have been some improvements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| have been made. There are some short term enhancements that could be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| can be made in the interim. But again, we need to pull a comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| together, get additional community input, because that's been over to 2.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| 3 years ago, since we last got community input as relates to the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| Tennessee Design Center's initial drawings and renderings for Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| improvements. Also, I do want to mention because I do, even though we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| challenged with food deserts in East Knoxville, there is a grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| Save A Lot, that is in Burlington. So for anyone who is members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| who are not aware of that, or anyone that is maybe on the outskirts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| community, uh, that is a walking distance for residents as well. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| smaller grocery store. Uh, but again, I don't want to negate the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| are in need of additional avenues for food sources in communities. But I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| want to bring that grocery store to everyone's attention that it is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| and it is really in the heart of Burlington there at the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| intersection there. I agree that facade more facade grants I need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| There was just one that was completed in Burlington and also engaging on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| different level. The property owners that are there in Burlington as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| because there are a lot of, you know, properties that have been vacant for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| many, many years. I don't know where we are in regards to. I know that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| there's one property owner who has not been responsive to communication about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| being a part of the revitalization. And so again, there's a lot of work to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| done at the table. I do see in the capital improvements the continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| investment commitments in the budget. Again, I do feel like this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| that we will look for to amend as we go forward, but just anxious to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| work started as relates to what does that plan look like and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| additional input and re engaging the island Burlington business group is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| where I think it is a critical piece of this. Thank you. Thank you, Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| Any other discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| this topic? This this Councilwoman Singh. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| Vice Mayor McKenzie, I have a question about when the Magnolia Avenue work was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| being done. There was a lot of discord and a lot of anger about it. Um, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| wondering about the process that's been done with Burlington versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| process that's been done with that was done with Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| So there were actually a lot of community meetings. However, the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| of those was spaced out pretty far, and this is why it's gonna be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| that we get the community and the drawings and the concepts back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| table. What do those look like? Freshly has have the thoughts and ideas from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| the community shifted since the last time that those drawings from the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Tennessee Design Center were rendered. One of the major, I think, areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| frustration for people was just the name and convention more so than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| anything when it came to Magnolia and the branding of Magnolia and what what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| that would be. We did get past that. I know that, you know, we heard some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| people say that they felt like you know, they didn't think that that was a wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| investment of money. However, I don't think anyone would disagree that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| investment that's been made is a huge improvement to what was their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| previously, and that's part of infrastructure for us to be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| private investment into our community, which would create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| I also understand that you don't mind because I was one of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| members who spoke out around Magnolia, and part of our concerns was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| that the MLK corridor study plan was not fully, fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| And so here was a new investment in infrastructure being made when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| infrastructure in the heart of black community was not being invested in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| completed. And we see with Burlington, we're still waiting. Apparently we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| another study to deal with traffic light, like streetlights that have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| are creating dangerous conditions for the community. We need a study to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| sure that's a priority for the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| Not a study, but that's what the community told me. You mean this was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| the list of stuff they've been asking for for a long time. And now that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| bring it up once again, we gotta have enough study to see if that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| priority of something to spend money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| And it's not. Yeah. And I look to David Bryce to correct me if I'm wrong, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| it's not on the traffic light per se, but it's in that interchange that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| adjacent to Burlington that would feed traffic into Burlington. Yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| that's a good point. And if I said study, uh, that was not what I meant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| say. I think I said we need to do public input to gauge priorities. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| enhancements plan that was done by the design center. They're a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| group work with them for nearly two decades. They're very good at bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| community members together and for developing conceptual documents, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| high level documents. And there's a whole list of things that are in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| document. Um, now we need to figure out what are exactly the priorities from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| within that document that we want to fund on. So what does the community see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| out of that document to go first? And so, um, there are, you know, lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| things in that plan, and we need to figure out what the priorities are. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| it's not. It's not a detailed engineering study. It is a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| engagement process that we would we would help lead with you and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| And obviously, Vice Mayor McKenzie has been working in Burlington for a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| long time on. We would then once those priorities have been determined, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| would then start the actual engineering work and hire a consultant to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| and do the actual construction documents to build what priorities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| been identified. And so I think we will do that. It will take a few months to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| do that. Uh, and then we can move forward with construction documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| and then we'll be ready again for the next budget to look at funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Thank you, Mr Brace. And let me also add, uh, as it relates to that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| it is being, um, at least two years since community input was given on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| those East Tennessee designs. I do think that we need to open that back up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| get additional, uh, feedback. I will say, uh, in our transparency that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| of the one of those community meetings that I attended was at Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Library, where there was a majority of people who were not didn't look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| the community, the Burlington community. And, um, so there was a person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| actually made a statement that said, Hey, I want to make sure that when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| is done, that it is reflective of the community and the people who live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| this community. And so once again, I think that we we would do ourselves a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| disservice if we did not open that back up for community input. Then also, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| want to mention that I also look forward to working with our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| commission, our county commissioner to look at bringing county funds to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| table to help invest in Burlington as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Yeah, just the plug for everybody watching. If you go to the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| Tennessee Design Center's website, you can find the Burlington plan. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| a good starting point. Thank you, Miss Ryder. Did you have a comment? I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| know if you've raised your hand before that. Okay, go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Hey, that would be a new button. All right. Um, I'm not sure if it's my turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| to talk about something else or whatever. I wanted to ask Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| who I believe is on the call to clarify about something that was a concern to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| me that was commented on during the public speaking. We've made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| commitment to reduction of carbon goals, and I know the city has long been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| involved with weatherization for low income housing, and I was wondering if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| Miss Wade could comment on that because one of the speakers raised concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| about what they saw in the budget for weatherization. I was hoping Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| Wade could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Either one of you could speak to that, please. This is Aaron. I want to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| one particular question, and I'll turn it over to Becky. I believe it was Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Hughes mentioned a $7000 line item that's specific to the home energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| retrofit. Those are actually leftover grant funds from when we partnered with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| C. A. C. On the keen program, the Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| program. So those would not be considered, um, kind of general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| operating dollars from the city. Those were one time grant. This grant is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| best way to describe it, but it was actually a contract that we had with C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| A. C. To support that work, and that's what's remaining. So what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| sustainability office now does is to use portions of those funds were kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| of drawing them down year by year to support ongoing energy education. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| the energy we call things in the house workshops and other kind of small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| ticket initiatives. Also, there's a lot of funds there, but we use it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| support the C. A. C. And also to support ongoing energy education. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| very different from the community development dollars that go towards C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| A. C. To support home retrofits. And so I'll shift that to Becky's camp. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| I did want to clarify that $7000 is a very small, uh, remaining from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| program. Okay, and that's why that's such a small dollar figure. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| the same money that community development has for weatherization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| Thank you for clarifying. Um, okay, so Miss Wade. Yeah, I can. I can add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| that it's not reflected in this budget because it's covered under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| federal budget. Community development block grains that the city receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| from HUD, uh, helps to provide weatherization to housing through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| minor home repair program. The detail of our federal budget will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| presented to Council later this year, probably early July. But that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| numerous programs that focus on housing, neighborhood development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| community development and homeless services will be presented. So what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| What have we done in the past? And are we continuing to do weatherization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| And that's an important component. Yeah, this current year, we're spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=7005)|

| 2:21:16| that the city zoning ordinance allows the placement of a truck terminal on the I-3 portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| property, but not on the C6. The land in question was previously owned by Primos Land, which is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8482)|
| 2:21:30| of or related to the Smithville Homes. It is a total of about 36-37 acres with six acres being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8490)|

| 2:21:53| Our understanding is that in order for ESDs to purchase the land and build a truck terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8513)|
| 2:22:01| there, more buildable land was required. The size of the truck terminal plan was such that ESDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8521)|
| 2:22:09| wanted a minimum to park tractors on the C6 portion. In order to accomplish this, Primos Land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| and Smithville Homes and ESDs pursued the option of having the C6 portion rezoned to I-3. It is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8536)|
| 2:22:24| understanding that this was also their understanding as evidenced by a letter from the Zoning Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=8544)|

| 2:30:43| this appeal is going to be the interpretation of the C6 zoning by Mr. Aaron that apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| allows parking of tractors on the C6 property. I will focus on what the latest letter of June 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9049)|
| 2:30:57| 2019 from Mr. Aaron's to Mr. Sanderson actually states. So if you could put that letter on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| screen. The letter itself is not an interpretation in that it does not unequivocally state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| tractors can be parked on C6. In that letter when the letter comes up with the second paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9069)|
| 2:31:17| towards the end it says the site plan provided showed tractor parking to be located behind the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| employee parking. This layout will ensure that the buffer desired by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9083)|
| 2:31:29| is provided. This statement is essentially consistent with what the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| recommended when it was assumed that the C6 parcel would be rezoned to I3 but doesn't state that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9094)|
| 2:31:41| is a zoning interpretation. The issue of an adequate buffer is different from the parking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| tractors on the C6 parcel. So is there a basis or a rationale somewhere for an interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9107)|
| 2:31:55| of allowing tractor parking on C6? The only information I have about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| is from my discussions with the plans review personnel and from the defense of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| interpretation by Peter Aarons and Brian Berry at the BZA appeal in April earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9125)|
| 2:32:13| This interpretation seems to be something like this. These are I'm putting these words I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| trying to present what they're saying. They're saying C6 allows for truck sales and service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| facilities. It also allows for wholesaling and warehousing. In those two situations tractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9144)|
| 2:32:31| are present but that's not the critical element. It's the use or activity of those tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| Therefore according to their interpretation C6 does not automatically exclude the presence of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| tractors on the properties. As a result their conclusion is a reasonable interpretation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9163)|
| 2:32:49| that parking of tractors is allowed. Okay so I'm just giving you that's my interpretation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| they're saying. In this example that they provided of course tractors are present in both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| situations as well as in many other approved C6 zone properties. Tractors and trailers make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9180)|
| 2:33:07| deliveries all the time in a variety of commercially zoned facilities. However as Mr. Aarons pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| out in the BZA meeting presence alone is not critical. It is the activity or use and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9194)|
| 2:33:21| intensity of the activity which is important. If that is the criteria then there's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9201)|
| 2:33:27| difference in activity of tractors making delivery at wholesalers warehouse and the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9207)|
| 2:33:34| or storage of tractors at the proposed truck terminal. And there's a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| in activity or use between tractors at sales facilities and tractor parking at the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9220)|
| 2:33:47| truck terminal. Furthermore by this interpretation one could argue that since trailers are present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| and utilized on properties for wholesaling and warehousing that we should also allow the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| of trailers in a C6 parcel because the activity is the same. In other words this rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| why tractor parking should be allowed is an interpretation that changes the essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| content of the code and is one that should not be allowed. Furthermore any zoning interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9251)|
| 2:34:18| is one that establishes a precedent. Other companies may come along and use this interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| for other C6 parcels. If there were a carefully crafted written interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| with clear reasoning or a basis in the code itself it may be acceptable. However the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| interpretation that's given is so vague and undefined that it may allow any application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| on a C6 partial. One minute left. In rejecting this zoning interpretation this should not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| the end of the truck terminal on Estes property because we're not talking about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| we have a truck property. We're talking about the interpretation of the zoning code. So there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| several attractive options that Estes could consider. One they could build their terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9297)|
| 2:35:03| and make a smaller one or for example they could convert some of their trailer parking to tractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| parking. A second simpler thing to do would be for Estes to go back to the BZA and just ask for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| zoning variant. A zoning variant so they could park tractors on the C6 parcel. So even if Estes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9316)|
| 2:35:25| were to announce tonight that it plans to pursue one of these other options the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| should still avoid the current interpretation because of its vagueness because of its lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| a written rationale and because of its uncertain future use as a precedent. Thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9336)|

| 2:39:09| But this provided was the best area we found in this in the Knoxville area to put in a terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=9549)|

| 2:47:08| a background in public administration and I've never seen an appeal on a zoning administrator's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10028)|

| 2:47:22| of that zoning board appeal meeting. Notices in the paper don't really get out to Richmond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10042)|

| 2:47:36| denied that appeal and in going back in history as some of the other speakers that are for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10056)|

| 2:47:54| the primary reason that they were not approving the rezoning of that C-6 was they wanted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| ability to determine and have code that requires the necessary landscaping and buffering that did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10080)|
| 2:48:08| not appear in the I-3. Staff noted that the parking was allowed in the C-6 and that mitigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10088)|
| 2:48:18| the need for rezoning. Historically, the I-3 was zoned for truck term a long ago. The C-6 allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10098)|
| 2:48:26| access and parking back to the I-3. Rezoning denied to control development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10106)|

| 2:48:42| on the C-6 area. I think Mr. Fitz clearly determined that we have built with code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10122)|
