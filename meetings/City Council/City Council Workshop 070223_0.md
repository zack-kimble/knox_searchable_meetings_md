| 0:01:00| We maybe should have a prayer for our marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| Now I beg your pardon, if you will just bow your heads please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=63)|
| 0:01:12| Our Father, we come before you just praising you for the beauty of this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| After a long, dark, kind of depressing winter few weeks, we are so grateful for the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| of your world, and so grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=85)|
| 0:01:33| So grateful for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Oh, golly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| What's wrong with this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| How do you kill it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Well, it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| I think I need a new phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Thank you for understanding all of our failings, and how often we really mess up, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=100)|
| 0:02:01| just really grateful that you're the kind of Father who does understand that, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| would even chuckle when we need your forgiveness, and your acceptance, and your understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| We're grateful for being among friends, and people who are also very understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| We pray that you'll be with us as we look at this plan again today, and that you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| help us to always be open to the opportunities that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| I was like, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=166)|

| 0:03:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=190)|

| 0:03:14| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Councilman Woodhull wanted me to express his apologies for not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| He may be able to make it a little later, but he is at his daughter's high school on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| a function for her, and if he can get that wrapped up, he will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| But he wanted me to express that to all the participants and to let you know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| fact that he's not here does not diminish his concern and eager with regards to seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| the South Knox Waterfront plan go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Before we begin, would the Councilman from the 1st District like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| I know your light is on, good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| This workshop on the South Knoxville Waterfront was convened between first and second readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| related to the approval of several agenda items that came through the MPC, the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Planning Commission, having to do with the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| The primary one in the regulating plan being the rezoning to the new form-based zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I think probably everybody in this audience is pretty much familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| There are some other items on the agenda, the amendments to the major road plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| others, but the key is, of course, the zoning code itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| And really, the purpose of the workshop is because some folks wanted to have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| to air concerns, thoughts, ideas a little more, especially, I think, Mr. Prince from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| Renker Material wanted to have an opportunity to express his concerns and thoughts, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| we certainly want to hear those, and so we determined that the workshop was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| And the only other thing I would say as we move forward, we should understand that Walter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Kulash from the consulting team is here dealing with the street network, the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| part, roads, et cetera, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| And he has an obligation to be at the Cumberland Avenue plan presentation, public presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=314)|
| 0:05:23| at six o'clock at the University Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| And so he will have to leave a few minutes before six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| And so if anyone has any questions or anything that needs to be put to Mr. Kulash, then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| need to address that fairly early in the workshop session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| And with that, Mr. Vice Mayor, I'm ready to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Any other comments, questions from council members before we begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Yes, Councilwoman Riley, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| This morning I had the opportunity to attend a presentation at the Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| and it was in the newspaper day, so some of you may have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| They released a workforce development study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| And one of the components or recommendations, Councilman Hulkus was with me as well, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| that cities that are successful in this technology, information-based global economy are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| to attract 18 to 34-year-olds, because evidently that's the demographic that drives that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| of economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| And the cities that have done well have a hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| They mentioned Austin, Texas, and they mentioned Richmond, Virginia, but they said you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| try to be those other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| You have to develop what is unique about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| And my first thought was that the South Waterfront Plan has all the elements of being that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| of hook for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| We were thinking along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Just in terms of urban living and mixed use and restaurants and places to work and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| connectivity to downtown and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| So we're obviously on the right track in terms of what's needed to continue to develop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| great workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Does everyone have their agenda in front of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| The agenda in front of us has a discussion topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Number one, the transportation system and design, regulation, plan streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And actually, Mr. Koulosh, who Councilman Hulkus mentioned earlier, who has another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| commitment, is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| And why don't we start with that particular issue, if that's okay with you, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| I think the consultants are really here just to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| I don't think they have any presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I don't think there's anything new in terms of information to them to present other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| responding to concerns and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| I think that's really the format that we'll be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| So I think Councilman Becker has something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Yes, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I guess this is a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| I know there is some – actually, in this issue, there's been a lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| Are we going to hold all the public input for a public forum, or can we do this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| that's a little more interactive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| I think in light of the fact that the administration and the experts that are here don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=480)|
| 0:08:10| a presentation, maybe we should let the public talk, and then they'll just have to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| to that when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| I know Mr. Seymour spoke earlier that his client is here and had a couple concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Won't we allow him to speak at this juncture with the consent of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| I hope we don't rehash what we went through the other night because I think it was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| a few hours on the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Mr. Prenz from Rankin Material was not here, not able to be here last Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| And he brings, I think, a pretty unique perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| And if I could just let Ed say what he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Mr. Chairman, let me just, for clarification, do we want to try and do something that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| you know, transportation, then building height, then river setback as ways to handle the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Mr. Vice Mayor, you feel even more flexible today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| I feel even more flexible after just hearing about 505 that there was no formal presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| So let's be real flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I would say the only caveat is if they want to talk about transportation issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| we really need to get it on the table soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| Mr. Prenz, if it's all right with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Hi, my name is Ed Prenz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| I'm the Director of Real Estate for Rankin Materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| I appreciate the opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| And I'm sorry I couldn't be here at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| I just want to start by emphasizing one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| We are not against the adoption of the form-based zoning code for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| I think we've sort of unfairly been portrayed as part of a group of five property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| who seem to think that this is not the right thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| And I think that that's kind of hurt us a little bit because we are a major employer here in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| and in the State of Tennessee and in this general region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| And we are pretty firmly committed to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| We just made two major acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| So I really do not want to be portrayed as being against this form-based zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| Our goal really is to continue to participate in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| and hopefully be able to convince my senior management that it is economically feasible for us to move off this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=630)|
| 0:10:40| We, over this last year, have participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| I've either gone to all of the meetings or I've had members of the operating management here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| or Arthur has been here and reported back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| So we've really been a participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| The goal here is to have a code that provides the development community certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| And I've heard that said at several meetings, but I'm concerned that the way this is being handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| that certainty is not being built into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| A developer, when they come into a city, and if you want to attract the 18- to 34-year-olds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| and Austin is a great city, I've been there, I love Austin, and I think that's a great model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| But to attract the development, you have to be able to offer that developer certainty that when he comes in to sit with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| he's going to be able to present a plan that's going to go through a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| with some certainty that at the end of that process he's going to have an economically viable product to offer to those 18- to 34-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=699)|
| 0:11:49| I recently watched the DVD of the MPC meeting that I missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| where there were modifications that were made to the code that sort of took into account some of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| One of the commissioners, and I don't remember exactly offhand who it was, said something really salient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| which was, why make a code that we are readily going to break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| Why make rules that we're going to break with a potential for SW8 or a potential for alternative compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| when we're not talking about rezoning the entire city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| We're talking about rezoning a very small area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| And specifically, certain zoning designations like SW4 really affect three property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| I think SW7 affects one property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| So why not try to make the modifications to that code that will really address the development concerns now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=761)|
| 0:12:52| rather than say, okay, let's rush this code in, let's get it going, because it's 80% okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| but we'll address it in a year or we'll address it on a first-come, first-served basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| The concerns I have, and as they relate to our property, I just looked at the design vignettes that the consultant provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=786)|
| 0:13:17| and once again, there is a roadway that goes through our site and takes a good chunk of our site and makes it undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| This is the certainty that is not there in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| We have, over the last year, worked with Dave, worked with the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| We've given them alternative road alignments that would accomplish the same thing that they're looking to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| without affecting our property or Knox River Warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| And we've heard, not to worry, these are only preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| We'll discuss them as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Well, again, discuss as we go says to me that there's no certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| And it concerns me as a developer that I'm not sure where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| And I'll give you my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I've spent the last 27 years, I've only been with Rinker for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| but I've spent the last 27 years really as a cheerleader for redevelopment of old industrial areas for new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| I've taken tunnel tube manufacturing facilities on the Chesapeake Bay and have turned them into marinas and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| I've taken a steel mill in Buffalo, New York, and turned it into an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| So I understand the realities of taking codes and taking plans and making them economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| So that's one point, is the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| There's a great deal of uncertainty with that, including the extension of Hawthorne through our site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| which was never there until 1222 when revision number five came out during the Christmas holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| The other concerns that I have with this development is, as a developer, not as Rinker, but as a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| is that there's not enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Without the city providing a way to get people to the site, there is no plan for new parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=904)|
| 0:15:15| There is no plan for public transit that will address the concern of walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| I come from West Palm Beach, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| We have a wonderful development there called City Place, which was built under form-based coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| One of the things that we realized in Florida was that nobody walks and nobody can get there without public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| and we don't have an extensive public transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| The city and the developer built municipal parking garages on the perimeter of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| to provide ways for people to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Once you're there, you can walk around to your heart's content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Our concern is that, and I've heard this from several developers that we are talking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| is that where are we going to park people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| If somebody has, and again, the form-based code is a good thing because it allows anybody to put any use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| that they want there as long as it fits within the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| We've heard several people say to us, we want to put a hotel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Well, hotels need a lot of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Can't do it under the current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Retailers need a lot of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Can't do it under the current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Residential may not need as much because if you are correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| and you are going to have that urban kind of living, it may work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| But again, the city has to come up with a comprehensive transportation plan that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| this is how you get from your house to your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| or this is how you get from your house to this wonderful entertainment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| So that's a tremendous concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| The other concerns relate to restriction of development on the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| First of all, there's a maximum parcel size of three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| which further restricts the amount of building that one can put on a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| because you have to deal with setbacks, you have to deal with egress and ingress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| So, for example, we have a six-and-a-half-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| which means we would have to subdivide the property into two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| and deal with it from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That restricts the amount of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| The parking structures that are going to have to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| because we're not really supposed to have that much surface parking is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| because those parking structures are counted against the building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Well, if we're restricted to 50 feet or about four stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| more than likely we're going to have one or two stories of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| so now we're restricted to two stories of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| which makes this economically unviable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| or extremely difficult for somebody to build a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| because, don't forget, within that 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| you're also counted for any cornices, rooftop structures, and parking structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| so that further reduces the amount of height that you can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1086)|
| 0:18:17| So those specific issues concern me a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| The fact that I heard a lot of public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| about the fact that we're talking about views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| and we're talking about access to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| I would caution the city council in the sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| there is no access to the river today, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| And that is the real strength of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| is that you're going to get access to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| and with really good development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| you're going to have people being able to get to the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| where they can't get to it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| So if you start to restrict the amount of development you have on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| you still won't have access to the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| because no developer can afford to build on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| nor can Rinker or Knox River Warehouses or Specialty Chemicals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| afford to relocate because they can't get the financial incentive to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| The reality is, if you look at where the development is likely to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| over the next 15 to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| it's going to be from where City View is planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| which, by the way, will be a nonconforming use within the SW4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| because it was planned under the old zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| From that point, through Rinker, through Knox, through Specialty Chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| So from our standpoint, it should be the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| It should be the focus of the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| to make it economically viable so that we can take this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| and bring it to the development community in the best light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| So the other issue to remember, and this will be the last thing I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| because I don't want to keep everybody here all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| is that I think there is a public perception, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| that we have to rush this code to adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| because tomorrow, once the code is adopted, there will be development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| There will be a complete redevelopment of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| when in all reality, as Dave will tell you, it's a 15 to 20-year project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| and nothing may happen outside of City View for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| That is an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| It's not a question of rushing a code to the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| It's a question of creating an economically attractive product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| that will, in the end, spur that development that you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Any questions from anybody from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| My only comment, are there any comments that you would like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| to respond to the comments that have been just before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| I'd like Mr. Kulasch to answer some of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| or some of Mr. Prince's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| That's fine. I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| I'm Walter Kulasch, traffic engineer with Gladding Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| and part of the planning team for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| The concern about the parking is we understand that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Most of our business is with the private development industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Parking is the biggest issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| We also have a concern with parking ratios going much beyond three spaces per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| We frequently hear people say they need five or five and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| or even six spaces per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Our concern is that ratios above three spaces per thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| are almost certainly indicative that the developer intends to park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| their peak parking requirement, sometimes not the daily or weekly peak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| even the seasonal peak, on the premises of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| That is fine for suburban-style development where we have large acreages of parking available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| It works against every design principle that we're trying to do in the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| Now, should there be more than three spaces per thousand square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| if that's what the market is really demanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Of course there should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| The plan provides for that to be for spaces beyond the on-site limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| to be in the form of joint use with other parking that's provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| or publicly provided parking, either completely publicly provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| or in public-private partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| In a number of cities now we're working with exactly that kind of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| that is funded through the city's bonding power by parking authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| or just general obligation, but in which the development partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| buy spaces within that to supplement their on-site requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| So I think even though it can be interpreted as though these limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| are all the parking you're going to be able to get, I think by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| I think the two resources beyond the limit are joint use of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| with other tenants on the waterfront and then, in the longer run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| participation in publicly provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Just to give you an idea of the joint use, how powerful joint use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| we're working with several of these so-called lifestyle developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| these new projects that appear to be a main street environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| very much like what we would like to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| We have seen some of those mixed use of retail, office employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1430)|
| 0:24:00| nighttime entertainment in the form of restaurants and theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| We have seen that go through the market analysis, lender approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| who are usually the toughest nuts to crack about parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and public approval process at parking ratios of 2.8 to 3.0 spaces per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| How are they doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| They're doing it by simply, for example, in one that we're working with now in Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| the office building is empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| The parking is almost empty at night, 5% usage after 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| The theater, which is two blocks away in a superior walking environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| needs 600 spaces at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Why not have the theater use the office spaces, and then vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| the office use some of the other spaces that are available during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| particularly if the walking environment is superior, people want to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| and that the area has the bones, the network of small streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| which is why we're so insistent about streets penetrating the large sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| It all works together like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I think just to try to keep the answer short here is just that we should look beyond the onsite parking resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| I think the answer is yes, if we choose to go right up to the limit onsite, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1524)|
| 0:25:33| but be aware that we don't need to go to that limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| There will be opportunities for joint use participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| and then simply the joint use that we would expect in a vibrant mixed district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| particularly with these 18- to 34-year-olds willing to walk vigorously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| I think that we've got quite a few answers for the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| I want to ask you a quick question, Mr. Koulosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| For parking, and I guess this doesn't actually, well, it might even go to the Rinker property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| given that there's a public parking garage just on this side of the river that's pretty big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| would folks park there if that was available and then walk across the bridge to the south waterfront?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| We would not expect them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| That's beyond the typical kind of profile of distance that we are typically given by our commercial clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| They like to see, you know, a certain percentage met within 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| a certain percentage met within 500 feet, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Those limits do go up as the walk becomes nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| I mean, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Once you get inside a shopping mall, the average walk now is 2,600 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| so the atmosphere makes all the difference in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| The bridge is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| The river is interesting, but that's a pretty long walk for most of the customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Mr. Prince, did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Let me ask you a question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| We're not going to engage in back and forth question of presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| If you have a question, present it up here, and then if it's appropriate for him to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| but let's not get into back and forth, and you all have a debate out there in front of us, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Not intending to have a debate, but I guess I have to ask you the question, and we'll go back that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| You can ask it in a question or a statement, and then we'll give them an opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| In listening to that answer, I guess the question is, which comes first, the chicken or the egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| Where is the phasing plan that says you share parking this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| For example, if CityView is built, that's all residential parking that goes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And I know how people are about sharing their residential parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| It's very protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| For example, if our site were developed for entertainment, restaurants, hypothetically, hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| I'm not quite sure I got an answer as to how we share parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| In addition to which, if no other development occurs for the next three to five years beyond our site, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1692)|
| 0:28:21| where is the rationale for the sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| I understand in 15 years when everything is built, that makes a lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| but I still haven't heard where are we building municipal parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| and how are we providing public transportation to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| So I guess my question is, where is the phasing for this parking plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| Dave or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Again, I'd like to respond to some very valid concerns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| Number one, phasing frequently consists of regrettable, though we might think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| it consists frequently of substantial amounts of surface parking while sites are still vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| and while things are under development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| So part of the answer of phasing is there is a supply that we wish would not be there in the longer run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| that is definitely there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Typically, as an area like this moves ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| the typical pattern we see in community redevelopment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and business improvement districts and so forth is that they very early on develop a parking strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| and a parking plan that very aggressively looks for the joint use opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| So these kind of things are communicated back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| If someone is one project is very heavy on daytime employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| then the kinds of negotiation or understanding at their approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| about the basis for which that parking would be available for nighttime entertainment is established early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| And then, again, the plan is fairly silent on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| but I certainly can't iterate enough that we regard a public parking resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| in other words available to the parking no matter who owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| as absolutely critical to revitalization such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| And a parking plan should, in fact, address that very early so that if the chicken and egg problem is present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| and the chicken in the form of a large amount of entertainment actually leads the parade here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| and needs a parking resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| then maybe the time for the public involvement in the parking is way earlier than we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| and that the proposition of public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| and use of the city's bonding power and so forth comes into play at a very early stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| I think it needs a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Well, Walter is on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| One of the things that we have already issued in terms of an RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| and we had our pre-submittal meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| two of the public improvements that are considered priorities for fieldwork, schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and permitting are the Henley Gateway and then the, I guess what we've been calling the severe council place parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1879)|
| 0:31:30| So we do know the value of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| and those are part of the phase one efforts, maybe not to fund and construct them immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| but to start the design process so that we can match the phasing that Mr. Prince was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1898)|
| 0:31:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| I'm David Gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I'm an architect and urban designer with Chan Krieger and part of the design team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| I just wanted to address the other three issues that Mr. Prince brought up, the issue of block size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| the issue of the time frame of this, if this is perceived as being rushed through, and then the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| As you may know, the form-based code is comprised of graphics and language and definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| but it also has a regulating plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| That regulating plan is the graphic, which is essentially representing what the code is trying to describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| The roadway alignments are hatched on that plan as flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| meaning that actual alignment will be determined as that development moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| In the vignettes that we had done to test out these different sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| we showed it as professionals where we thought the best location would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| When a parcel, a large parcel such as six and a half acres, gets developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| that size of a development is actually going to need some internal servicing for whatever gets put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| The 1,200 lineal feet of block size we arrived at through two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| One is it's actually in the city's traditional neighborhood development code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| That's what actually the city is trying to encourage in these more pedestrian environments, so we got it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| But secondly, it's also the exact perfect block size of one of the existing blocks in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| And allowing access to the river, creating an environment that provides for more addresses for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| not less, but more addresses, more front doors, essentially, we see as an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Now, where that occurs, where the alignment occurs, will have to come later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| But we feel fairly confident that that size block is ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And, in fact, that's what you'll see around the glove factory site as that first phase goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| It's surrounded by a road, which allows access, and the very big building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| which you'll see come out of the ground fairly soon, is going to be within that boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| So we feel comfortable with that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| We're coming up on two years in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| About nine months through the form-based code, the visioning was about 13 months long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| And we've worked really hard to try to strike a balance in terms of where the interests lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| The number one pitfall that we've learned from other cities who are implementing this is that the code gets inhibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| because of very specific issues that can't yet be thought about until proposals come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| There's built-in flexibility to the code in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| One is if you don't follow the code, let's say for SW4, you go through an administrative deviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| similar like what you would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| You would, well, go in front of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| You would try to develop consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| You would demonstrate why, for example, you might need more parking instead of three per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| So that's one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And that flexibility, we think, is absolutely critical to allowing different projects to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| There's nothing that says you can't propose another alternative in order for development to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| So there is flexibility, both in the roadway alignments and also in terms of densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| or heights that need to be reached at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And we think that the balance has been struck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| and we've tried to test that through the developer vignettes of these 12 different sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| I think Mr. Seymour would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Come to the mic, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| Before Mr. Kulosh leaves, Mr. Gill had a question about the roadway alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Can we pose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Because he's going to leave in a few minutes, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| I'm Hoyle Gill, and I'm with the Knox River Warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| And I'm going to really address one issue, road alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| We've had a major problem from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| This is not something that's just come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| Every time we turn around, there's a different alignment of a road going, just like Mr. Prins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| And he's seen changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| They changed again in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| And I saw another change last week in this vignette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| But the road, this is the Knox River Warehouse property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| They're coming through, cutting Mr. Prins' property in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| cutting about almost 40% of our property with the road right through here into Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| My office was right here for 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And I know the speed of the cars on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| You know, and Mr. Kulosh, you know, we're looking at calming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| I can guarantee you, unless you put major speed bumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| that these cars will be going right through the renter property and our property 20, 25, 30 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| unless you put stoplights or something to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| And I don't think you want that in a developed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| As far as getting to the water, Clancy Avenue runs almost to the water right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| It'll take a very little extension to get people to the water right beside our property between us and specialty metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| We've had a developer, too, that's looked at this, one in particular that's not even interested in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| one that is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| And they really didn't like the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| And I know we keep saying, well, the road can be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And you said another alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| I'm going to give you an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Just do me a favor once again, direct your comments to the council up here, and then we'll allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| We need to look at the water as an alternative now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| We don't need to have roads through here and say, well, these can be changed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| We can move them this way or that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| You know, we just need to get them off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Now, developers are going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| They're going to determine, just like City View, they put their roads on their property, around their property to move people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| But they don't have a road cutting their property in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2273)|
| 0:38:07| Again, this is the Rinker property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| This is our property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Here's the Clancy going almost to the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| The road they're proposing comes right through the center here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Now, there's a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| There's only one reason we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| There might be another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| But the reason we've been told is that's part of the Figure 8 traffic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| It will take traffic down Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| When the new road goes off the Cherokee Bluff back under or over the railroad into the new Augusta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| which whenever that's done, that will be part of the Figure 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Personally, I've seen this for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| I think that could very easily be accomplished just by coming down Blunt Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| and angling off on Clancy right on Scottish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And this, you know, the cars won't be going 35 or 40 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| There's an interchange there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| But if you want cars to go faster, you can come down Blunt Avenue and angle right through here into Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2342)|
| 0:39:12| And this will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I was over the citizens group under Mayor Ash for five years for road planning in Knox and about half of Blunt County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| You know, I've been in the road building business for interstates, all kind of roads, Virginia, all over Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| for 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| So roads, I don't profess to be a traffic expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| but I've been heavily involved in roads and road planning and where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| But, you know, this will work right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And, actually, we own some of the property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| It won't be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| It is waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| But we just hate to see property cut, a major road just cut through a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| The developer will come in and they'll put roads in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| They have to have roads in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| But we don't want a major road through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I'll leave this here if somebody wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Have you had an opportunity to present it to Mr. Hill prior to today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| The first meeting we had when I saw that road and Mr. Gamble was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| and I saw that road out of the big 200-something people meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and I said, we can't have that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I've worn that road subject out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| A lot of the people here have heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Mr. Hill has heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Mr. Gamble has heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| So I'll leave this here if somebody wants to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| If I could get a quick response, I think, real quickly, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| I'm not going to give you the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Walter can do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I do think that the point that we've been trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| and I think this is kind of turning into a hypothetical argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| because I know that we've already had discussions with folks, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| on the Connelly property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| And we, because of the specific plans that they were proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| we actually shrunk the park land just a little bit so that it would fit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| kind of development product that they were trying to fit on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| of the marathon petroleum tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| The point that we're trying to make, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| by having that graphic symbol that says flexible road alignment in here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| that there's a certain functionality that has to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| And I have absolutely no qualms with Mr. Gill saying it can be done a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| It may well be that it can be done a different way, and we're all ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| but we do have to maintain the functionality of that figure eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Now, in terms of the traffic speeds and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I think Walter could answer those for you if you want to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| But I do not think what we're trying to do is force an alignment onto that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| and I think that's why we decided that it was perfectly appropriate to add the language saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| you know, the alignment would be specifically determined at the time that the property is redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| We have no interest in trying to put a road in that doesn't enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| and support the accompanying redevelopment that would go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| And I'm not sure if you want to leave a copy of that map with the council officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| or you want to take that with yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| but I think I hear what you're saying about the flexibility and hopefully that will bear fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| And then I understand we also have some folk here who want to speak right now from the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| I just want to make sure that if anyone has something that they want to address that's transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| I mean, it's 545 now and it's going to take Mr. Kalash a few minutes to get over to the university center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| so I know that there's some people in the audience that want to express themselves also that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| or may not have been heard from yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| We'll allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| And I know we have Councilman Becker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| And I'm very sensitive to that, but I'm also, as this council knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| very sensitive to the fact that these workshop times are set up right here before we were all elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| As a Thursday 5 o'clock workshop, let's set it aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| And I do get frustrated when we have workshops and there's other meetings that have been scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| And I've expressed that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| And now we have this time constraint up against what is a traditional time for us to have workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| So we'll work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| But I think the council understands, and I've asked before on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| let's make sure and try not to have community meetings and other meetings scheduled at the same time that we have workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| especially in light of the fact that we have a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| very active council that likes to have public participation, expects it, and likes to have the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| And I expect that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| So at this juncture, if there is someone here who wishes to speak that has spoken to Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| say someone from the community, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| You haven't signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| We're kind of operating a little differently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| But come up and just recognize our time constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and recognize we have experts here that have to get down to Cumberland Avenue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| And I'm sure we have maybe some other issues that may need to be discussed back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| So if there is someone here apparently who wishes to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| I'm not real sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| If you just want me to address roads, I don't have much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| If you want me to say the things that I would like to say, I have a few other points I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| So give me some direction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Well, Councilman Holquist came to me and whispered in my ear that somebody really wanted to speak and had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| The first priority, Walter, is getting ready to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| So if there's anything that's specific to that, let's cover that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| You might need to identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| We all know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Elm Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| I'm a little bit discombobulated that we're in here talking about road alignments and lot sizes and parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2712)|
| 0:45:21| because I sort of thought those issues had been resolved before this went to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| except for the road alignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| and I thought that the amendment that was offered at the first reading sort of took care of the road alignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| So I'm not really ready to speak much to those other issues other than to say I thought we had those off the table already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2734)|
| 0:45:43| I did want to say just a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| and I'll try to be brief in response to some of the things I've heard here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| and I don't want to say things I said at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| You've heard that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| First of all, there was some point made about getting this code absolutely right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| and not having this alternative route because it's like there was a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| Every zoning code has some kind of flexibility built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| I don't know of any zoning code, including our current one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| that isn't set up to allow for exceptions when exceptions are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| And I know Councilman or Vice Mayor, excuse me, Brown, at the council meeting last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| expressed a concern that if a developer went the alternative compliance route that the community might be upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| And I think the word you used is would we feel betrayed if a plan got approved under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| And I wanted to make the point that we all understand that that alternative compliance review is in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| We want it in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| We think it's absolutely necessary that it be in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| because there will be some good project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| specific project on a specific piece of property that comes along that doesn't exactly meet the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| but is true to the intent of the vision plan and that we all think should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| And in no way will the community feel betrayed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| In fact, I think you'll find the community being very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| Comment on the idea of whether we should go ahead and adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| whether we're rushing to adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I think there was a comment made that other than city view, there may not be anything done in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| I think you all are aware that there are at least two developments that are pretty far down the road with site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| And people who are wanting this code out there so they can go ahead and develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| And I would really urge you to keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| because I understand that these folks have concerns, but these folks don't have definite plans yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| And there are folks out there who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| One other comment, and I guess this has to do more with the building heights than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| but when I sat in the oversight committee meeting and Mr. Seymour came and presented his issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| and we kept hearing, as we've heard tonight, these restrictions are too tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| We won't be able to develop our property and make a good enough return on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| The economic incentive won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I kept looking for some evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| I'm hearing a lot of opinion and I'm hearing, I guess, what is fear and concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| But what I haven't seen is somebody show me evidence that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| On the other hand, the evidence that I have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| some of which comes from two members of our own oversight committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| who own large pieces of property and who are getting ready to develop under the new codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| who seem to be perfectly happy with going ahead, who I'm sure intend to make a good profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| and who are developing in SW2 districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| which are more restrictive than either the SW4 or the SW7 that's under discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| So I'm looking for evidence and I still haven't seen evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| And so absent that evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I would just hope that you guys will continue to do what you did in first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| and pass the code in second reading in the same form that you did in first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Hold on just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Let me make sure that, since I've been quoted, that it's perfectly clear what I meant and what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| What I said was that if the appeal process is utilized by a developer and it comes to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| and the community then says, we don't think it should be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| and this council then votes with that developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| that's when they will feel there's some sort of possible trail to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| and that if we can do things on the front end that will prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| or help us not have to come back to that appeal process, that will be all the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| So I did speak to the issue of feeling betrayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| but that was only if you go as far as council voting against what the neighborhoods may want down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| So let's just add that next little step to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| And I think we have someone else from the community who wishes to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| This young lady has been standing for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Come forward and give us your name and address, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Patty Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| I think mine is more a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| I was talking to someone the other day, and this is once again on the right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| but I actually had a chance to go out to the town center this last weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| and I was going to take some pictures, but the camera broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| I noticed at the town center that the street widths are really not as wide as the 50-foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| and I guess my question is, I know there's going to be field surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| and I know there's bids out now for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| I think my question is if it's determined that 50 feet is not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3053)|
| 0:51:04| I mean, we don't want 50 feet taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| We think that's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| But if it's determined that it's not really needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| and with the neighborhood's input when the street is planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| or the design of that street is planned for Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| can the right-of-way be reduced also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Is there flexibility in this plan for that 50-foot right-of-way to be decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| And I think that's what our question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Most people don't want to see the 50-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Some people would like to see the sidewalks and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| We know that there will be a field survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| but 50-foot, can it be reduced down once Phillips is starting to be looked at to be redone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3104)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Councilwoman Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Ms. Barrier, just a question to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| You went to the North Shore Town Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| You just said the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| I wanted to be sure that we clarified what you were speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| I've been there as well, so I'll follow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Yeah, I was just going to ask Dave or Mr. Goulash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| My sense, Ms. Barrier, is the answer is yes, that if we don't need that, we wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| I don't think the city is in the habit of taking property we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| I think we'd give it away eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| My sense is the answer is yes, but I'd love to hear that for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| As part of the RFQ that was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| we indicated that we would be asking for professional surveying services for Langford, Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| portions of Blount, and Augusta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And if there are others, we can consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| But the whole idea is we don't see anything really happening to these within a year, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| And so I think what I tried to indicate to Patty and to Martha Olson as well was let's get the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| and see really what the existing right-of-way is, and then let's come back and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| And certainly part of that annual review would include that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Let me also just add to Dave's comments that we have a streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| Could you come up to the podium so we're on camera and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| This is David Gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I also wanted to add to Dave's comments that we added a line in the streetscape standards that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| all detailed design will be dependent upon these surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| The precise example that Patty's mentioning is Phillips doesn't have any sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| The street section that we're showing includes sidewalks on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| The issue came up at a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Is that really necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| And, well, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| So we'll have to look at it as it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| You mean sidewalks on both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Right, perhaps on one side or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Yes, Counselor Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| I think Mr. Prince has a comment he'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| And then we'll get to some more folks from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Ed Prince, I just wanted to provide some evidence that was asked for by Ms. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3248)|
| 0:54:17| As an example, if we were to build, and as of right on our site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| I think we can build somewhere under this form-based code somewhere around 180,000 square feet of new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| 100,000 square feet, let's go for round terms, would require under the code or maximum of 300 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| At 350 parking spaces, at 350 square feet per parking space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| you're talking about 105,000 square feet of parking that would have to be accommodated in structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| Now, if the maximum floor plate on a site, and I may be wrong that that's what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| but if it's a maximum of 30,000 square feet, to accommodate 105,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| we're now talking three stories of parking, which leaves us one story of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| That can't be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| So that is somewhat of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I will tell you that we are currently talking to two developers interested in our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| One of them, if they become the developer who purchases the site or joint ventures it with Rinker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| would be a credit to this community and has done major, major redevelopments of downtown throughout the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| very similar to what Rouse did with the Inner Harbor in Baltimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| They're telling me that that provides them inflexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| That, to me, is evidence that I'm having a problem with the code the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| We have some other citizens who wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Ms. Stanley, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Whitney Stanley, 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| I'm going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Number one, I was extremely proud of all of you all and what you did at first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| and I hope that you will do the same thing in second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| And secondly, this has been such a public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and hopefully this process can be used in other parts of the city to do other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| It has been one that has been time-consuming for both developers and neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| and it has been one that we have worked closely together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| And I am a little bit concerned that at this point we're being portrayed as all of a sudden it's become neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| versus development, and that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| This has been a joint effort that I think I don't want to see it become anything less than that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3404)|
| 0:56:53| And certainly the neighborhoods are very flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| We just this process has had too much input, and I think that sometimes the majority needs to rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3415)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Did you want to have anything else to say, Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| We can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Come forward, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Just give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Ma'am's name is Carol Allen, 212 9 Spence Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| I think the thing I'm hearing tonight is there's concern about the word flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| And I hear the word flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Flexible means flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| It doesn't mean there's anything that's in one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| It doesn't mean there's a sidewalk on two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| It doesn't mean a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| And I think all of those things can be determined and will be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| and have the confidence that the plan is written so that that will be known when that gets ready to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| The second thing is the plan that's drawn with all the different SW numbers throughout the waterfront is interconnected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| so that the sight lines and the heights don't restrict the views behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| don't restrict the building views behind it, the view of the ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| the view of the north side of the river, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| So I think, in fairness, to talk about changing on SW4 or on SW7 without then changing a 5 behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3486)|
| 0:58:15| or a 3 next to it or the neighborhood that's going to get squashed because it's one story high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| and the thing next to it is going to be gargantuan is a little ridiculous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| and then throws us way back to basically step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| And I think we're so far past that and so much time has transpired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| and so many good expert opinions and good hard-earned hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| and intent in making this a good plan would basically be undone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| where the way it's done is based on good development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| and how everybody can have a good development on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| That's the other thing is the fairness to, you know, the neighborhoods want to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| the people that own property either want to function in their existing role for as long as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| without having a road come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| I think all of that's been already determined and laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Everybody that has a piece of property should be able to develop it within these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| or within some alternative code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I don't think it's restricting anybody that they can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| The other thing we keep hearing is people are talking about developing these properties themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| or they're talking about everybody that's coming already to talk to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| some of whom have decided it's not developable within those codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| but people are talking about developing the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| There are people that are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| There are people that are already going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| There are people that are happy with the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| There are many of us that are happy with the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| And somewhere out there, if it's not the person they're talking to now or if it's not them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| it'll be somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| This is too good of a site with three miles of waterfront to think that there's not going to be some good use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| of those properties that would be able to conform with all of these things or some appeal to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| And I also would like to say the same thing Whitney said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| and that is thank you all so much for having this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| and thank you for your thoughtfulness and listening to those of us who wrote you e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| or called you or talked to you before or after the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| We do appreciate all that you're doing in trying to help this very public process go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| And I hope it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| And I ask for your vote on second reading with the changes as you did on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Yeah, I wanted to ask David or Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Mr. Prince got up a minute ago and talked about having to build three stories of parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| to have one story of building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| And he said, I think, he said in an interest, maybe I misunderstand the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| I'm going to answer that question by saying I know I misunderstand the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Can you explain a little more what, you know, what really will happen with that building that he talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| Well, we specifically made a revision based on that exact issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| When we approached the January MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| and in draft number six for each of the different zoning districts under property development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| where it says building siting and configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Do you have a page for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| The example I'm looking at right now is SW3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| It's on page 4.3-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| And near the very bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| 4.3-5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| 4.3-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| It's the yellow header.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And under the building siting and configuration, near the bottom, just above the floor area ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| it says footprint slash floor plate, and it says 30,000 square foot maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| does not apply to structured parking footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| So that was intended to keep that 30,000 square foot maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| from impinging on the ability to build structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| So how would his building look differently with that provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| Well, with that provision, he can basically cover whatever part of the site he decides is economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| to build a parking structure for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| The parking structure could be huge and the building would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And then the buildings themselves, the footprint would be limited to 30,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3738)|
| 1:02:28| Does that make sense, Mr. Prince?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3749)|
| 1:02:41| Yeah, I recognize that ability to do that, but it sort of does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| One, it still requires you to count parking levels against the height of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| So even if you spread it out over as much as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| you're more than likely still going to have no less than two stories of structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| And it seems also that the issue of parking to me is a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| because I think you would rather have a taller parking structure on less land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| than a larger parking structure on more land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| if the intent is to provide views and provide access to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| So it's kind of a conundrum that I don't think has been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| Well, let me ask, Mr. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| In the number of parking spaces, I'm not a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| and you've obviously done a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| For that size building, is that a reasonable number of parking spaces to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| I mean, one of the things Mr. Coulosh talked about is sort of peak versus shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| I mean, is the number there good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Are we requiring too many parking spaces or too few?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| It's going to be dependent on use, not dependent on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| It's going to really be a retail structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Retail is going to require more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| and office is going to require more than a residential structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| So that one's going to be up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| The concern I have, again, is, and I think it is, the vision I think is solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| It's a great vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| The whole idea of taking an old, underutilized industrial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| and creating this kind of attractive development is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| It's what a lot of cities have missed the opportunity to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| and I think you all are to be commended for recognizing the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| The issue with the parking and the phasing and the public transportation, that's the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| because are we going to talk about people parking on vacant lots for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| or are we going to talk about a concerted plan that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| the city is building a municipal parking garage right there on Blount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| and everybody walks from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| or is there a transportation plan that says, hey, you're going to park on this side of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| and you'll take a light rail or you'll take a bus or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| So from the standpoint of a developer, yeah, those are issues that would concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| But in general, I think the vision is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| I mean, I get excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| I've done these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| It's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| And to stand here, and I really, again, it kind of hurts to be perceived as being against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| because we really are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| We really just would like to get a plan that would allow the development, not allow more debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| You know, again, flexible is a scary word to a developer from the standpoint of having to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| alternative compliance or go through an SWA public hearing is scary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| because if there is all that flexibility that we keep hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| why is there so much resistance to changing what we think will help the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Mr. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Don't sit down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| I hear what you're saying about the parking, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| and you heard what Mr. Kulash said, that there are ways of dealing with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| and what you want is some certainty that those ways will be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| whether it's surface parking provided at adjacent sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| somebody's got to provide that surface area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| or public parking, structured parking that's early, phased in early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| which is one of the things he said we may need to look at depending on the types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| that are anticipated in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I guess I'm not sure if I have a question for you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I'm trying to get a feel for what it takes you to get to a comfort level there in terms of what would you like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4001)|
| 1:06:51| happen in terms of, you know, we're talking joint development agreements with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| We're talking about it on the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| That's what's happening with CityView now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Inevitably, that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| So there's going to be a lot of hand-holding there, and the city's committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| I think we've made it very clear, both in what we've said publicly throughout this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| certainly Mr. Hill has strongly represented that position as the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| And I think by our actions with CityView is our first example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| So there has to be a certain level of trust, if you will, that we're serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| and we're going to meet you at a point that will help make you whole in your deal-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| and make your deal work, you know, for everybody's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| So, I mean, what's your reaction to what I just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| Well, I want to start out by saying that I hope you realize the fact that I've spent as much time in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| over the last year also demonstrates to the city the serious commitment that Rinker has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| to doing the right thing as a corporate citizen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| because one thing that we do throughout the communities that we work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| is work very closely with the communities to make sure that when we do have surplus property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| or properties that could be sold, that we return them to economically contributing members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| So I hope you understand our commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| And again, as I said before, I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| To make me feel comfortable was the original amendments that came back from the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| that went to City Council reading on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| That would give me a level of comfort that a developer, and please understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| I'm not the end-all, be-all of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| I mean, I've done my share of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I've done my share of preparing properties for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| But there are plenty of people who can probably figure out how to make something work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| But from where I stand and with my experience, I would say that the amendments that were proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| to the City Council in the first reading that came out of MPC would make most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| and that's not just myself but the other property owners that are representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| probably close to one-third to one-quarter of the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| that would make us feel a little more comfortable that the developers will be attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| just based on my conversations with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| I mean, I guess the question I have too is, for example, if we had a hotel use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| how do we accommodate parking for a hotel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| How do you say to a hotel guest, you've got to park 500 yards down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| while we're building the parking structure five years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Those are the issues that make developers nervous, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| I mean, at the end of the day, we can continue to operate there for the next 15, 20, 30 years with no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| The issue is that it becomes attractive to us to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| if it becomes attractive to a developer to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And I think you partially answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| It wasn't sort of a vague and general question anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| Going back to the building heights issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| I want you to give you a feel for where I perceive this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| I think your point is well made that you probably have a strong argument for more building density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| and probably more building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| The question is how we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| If we allow it by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| one of the concerns we've heard consistently throughout this process, not just from the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| but from many, many people engaged in the process, is we don't want to see a canyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4230)|
| 1:10:38| We don't want to see a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| We want to see creative approaches to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| And to me, what we're talking about allowing by right is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| But we're talking just by right under the form-based code with, you know, an SW4, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| But we're talking about an alternative process, which I realize doesn't offer the same comfort level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| But the comfort level it offers a lot of other people is that there will be a further review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| that will allow some determination, some feedback, say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| you have to orient your building so that it's perpendicular to the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| or you have to consider these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Whereas we don't want to try to lock anybody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| We want to give them the opportunity to be creative and to come up with responses to concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| And I think that's where that extra level of review is so critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| And I understand that by injecting another level of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| it lowers to a certain degree the level of certainty that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| or a developer would have concerning the disposition of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| And, you know, that's a problem in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| But, I mean, that's life is my perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| You know, there's always got to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| You have to find that balancing point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| And to me, I think we're close to that balancing point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| I'm not saying we've got a perfect process or code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| I think it's going to have to be fine-tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| And fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| I don't think we can sit on it for a long period of time before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| But I think, and by fine-tuning, I mean the alternative compliance review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| whatever SW8 ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| But I'm just trying to get a dialogue going here, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| But I think that we can get there and meet all of your needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| and concerns to the point at least that you can profitably develop your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and relocate your business as you would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Well, I guess I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| It's only fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| When you talk about alternative compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| why not have kept the existing zoning which allows for alternative compliance already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| and would go through the MPC and city council review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| I thought the purpose of redoing this code was to provide a guideline and a vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| a way to execute a vision in a way that you wouldn't have to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| When we first started talking about, and we talk about the length of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I've been involved in the process for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| but it didn't get to the point of this until the 22nd of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| when the fifth draft came out during Christmas vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| So we really didn't get to it until the beginning of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And then the MPC meeting, I believe, was in the middle of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| So there really wasn't a lot of time to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| So from that time issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| But in that time frame, SW-8 was created as another alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| So we had alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| It was suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| It was suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Right, sorry, not created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Not fully created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Right, not fully created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| But it was suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| But I think, again, that was suggested because it may be a concession that flexibility or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| the existing code didn't necessarily answer all the development concerns that we raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| So my question is, why not keep the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| which already has alternative compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| rather than going to completely new-based zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| and then offer alternative compliance in SW-8 also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Well, I think other people might want to speak to that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| I'm not going to try to hog this conversation, but too much longer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| But the baseline formless code that we've got that's before us now is much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4484)|
| 1:14:53| much different than the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| The existing zoning is industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| No, no, I'm not talking about the I-2 zone, but I'm saying like C-2 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| C-2, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| So where you still have the ability to develop, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| under the existing zoning without going through this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| The existing zoning, though, C-2 has no limits on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| But I'm not advocating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| All I'm saying is that if we are talking and you're asking me how a developer becomes comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| he becomes comfortable when he or she can look at that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| and develop an idea that they have a reasonably good chance of getting approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| without having to go through the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Because as great as the public process is, and believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| I work for the New York City Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| and over the last 27 years I've gone through my share of public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| alternative compliance puts a great strain financially and time-wise on developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| when the public has a chance to say, hey, you know, we don't like this, we don't like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| we don't like this, and by the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| and I've been to too many meetings that have gone until 3, 4 a.m. in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| where, you know, everybody says, oh, we're flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| But, you know, the second somebody comes in and proposes, let's say we adopt the code the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| and it's a 50-foot height in SW-4 with the wedding cake back to 70,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| and we come in with a different idea, which we've heard, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| come in with a different idea that we think is, you know, you're going to love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| But we bring it out and it goes through alternative compliance and it goes into the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| and somebody says, well, there's no way in hell we like, you know, we like the 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| Where's the flexibility there? Where's the certainty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| That really is the major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| And, again, you know, I'm not in the real estate business in traditional sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| I just supply concrete and asphalt and aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| So all I'm trying to do is make sure that the developer who comes in after we leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| is able to do what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| I'll defer to someone else now before they all leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| This is going to be really hard, but I'll try and talk for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Thank God somebody laughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| I guess it was actually a really good discussion about why we're doing some of the things we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and sort of the sense of, and you asked the question earlier that I originally put my light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| about why have the alternative, not just make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| And what I've always heard, and it sort of came out in some of what Joe said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| is that by right you can build a real ugly building if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| and at some level I think what we're saying is we're only going to let small, ugly buildings come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| And as a developer I know there's that challenge of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| who's going to decide whether it's ugly or not when I come to this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| And the only thing I'd say is you've got to guarantee you can build a building 50 foot with a wedding cake up to 70 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| and make it as ugly as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| But what we want actually, and I think this is part of it, we want that prettiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| We want the really good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And so I think that's part of why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| And I know Ms. Craig has come down to the microphone and looking like she wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| Ms. Pelow, can we fit her in before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Does that feel okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| I know we're not supposed to be debating back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| but I did hear some questions that I think I can at least partially answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| One of them was why are you all okay with the flexibility in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| but you don't want anything changed now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| There's a big difference between looking at a particular project for a specific piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| with a fairly detailed site plan and taking a look at that and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| does this meet the intent of the vision plan, even though it's sort of outside the limits of the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| There's a big difference between that and just saying, okay, you've got 90 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| go build anything you want to 90 feet high anywhere in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| That's the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| And as to the why don't we stick with the same code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| I agree that part of what we're trying to do in the form-based code is make things more certain for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and make it easier and faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| If they meet the code, they don't have to go through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| It's a streamlined process, and we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| It's a very good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| But that's certainly not the only reason we're going to the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| We're going to the form-based code because it supports the ideas in the vision plan of trying to develop an urban feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4779)|
| 1:19:49| an urban neighborhood, a walkable neighborhood, pedestrian-friendly access to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| All those kinds of things are in that form-based code, and we don't have them now in the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| So there's a whole lot of different goals and objectives that that form-based code is trying to satisfy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| and we need to be sure we always keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| And, you know, it is a balancing game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I mean, I think the city and the consultants and the oversight committee all through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| have looked really hard at trying to balance the interest of all stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| and you all know that's not easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| And we all need to do the best we can with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| but we need to keep in mind always that we have a lot of different interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| and we need to find a point that works for as many of them as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Well, I think just what I would like to comment on are a couple of things, Mr. Prince, that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| which, you know, really rang a bell with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| Because as council members, we're in a unique situation here, and it has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| And I think the fortunate thing is that it has occurred while this entire council has been seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| because it could have occurred where we had elections and a shift in people that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| So I think it's been a very good thing for the entire process that, fortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| we've all been able to avail ourselves of a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| and in contact with the neighborhoods, with the business owners, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| So those are some things I think we need to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| because when we talk about rushing into something, then I can see with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| we're going to have a mayoral election in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We're going to have several council members whose seats are up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I think that's one of the things that I see as kind of not pressuring me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| but giving me a sense that it's very important to deal with this in a timely way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| Now, let's go to a couple of other points that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| I won't say enjoyed at this time of day, but I will say I've really been ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| your presentation has been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| It's been interesting and some things that I had not heard previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| So I appreciate you being willing to come and speak with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| This has been a public process, an extremely intense, lengthy public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4940)|
| 1:22:28| And as I said at council the other evening, you know, you couldn't be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| The interesting thing is my first meeting, which was one of those big 200 meetings, plus meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| which was exciting to see that many people who were paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| But on the other hand, it just seemed like many diverse positions, attitudes, heritages, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4964)|
| 1:22:54| that I just really did not believe that we would ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| and I think the mayor commented on that after I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| that we just didn't ever believe that this would ever come to a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| Well, you know it has, and that's an extraordinarily wonderful thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| and I know you would agree because you have participated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| So I think a lot of us are feeling very sensitive to the fact that it was a very open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| a very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| Now let's go to what has happened between, I believe you said December 22nd and January, when the MPC met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| And I was there because I wanted, well, I generally attend MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| but I wanted to be there certainly to hear this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| You know, MPC was invited a couple of times for special hearings before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| And regrettably, only a very, very few, not even a whole handful, attended those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5025)|
| 1:23:53| And I say regrettably because I think they needed to be apprised of all of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| all of the process that had occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| Consequently, when they deemed it wise or whatever to change the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5044)|
| 1:24:16| and to amend it and then present it to us, you know, that puts before us an enormous dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| because, number one, they don't represent any areas in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| Some of them are not even city residents or representative of the city in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| And that weighs on my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| The other was that for some of them it was really their first informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| And while it was a very good discussion and a very open discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| I just don't believe that they had the same basis for making a decision that some of us feel that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5091)|
| 1:25:01| And I don't believe that they had to respond, have to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| with the same sensitivity that we do as elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| And also, we're going to be responsible for financing a great amount of the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| that need to be made for this all to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Consequently, I think it weighs on us, in a different respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| to have been very fully informed and very fully involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| So I just wanted to say that because, to me, their impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| just on first hearing or first involvement, might be quite different than ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| where we have been so involved with all of the changes that have been occurring over this period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| and all of the different parties that have tremendous interest in it, as do you, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| I wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| And then I know you don't like the word flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| You've told us you don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| I'm sorry you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| As you know, if anybody asked me what was the very best trait that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| that is incorporated into my personality and my thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| I have often responded, flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| Now, you know, that's something I didn't have when I was younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| I didn't have four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| I didn't have 14 grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| I didn't have a lot of experience out here in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| I could be very, just extremely static in my thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| and very sure I was absolutely 100% correct because I always am, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| But as I have matured and as experience has taught me, flexibility is a critical trait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| And I don't think it's always a negative trait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I think it is generally one that means we're still thinking, that we're still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| What I see here, and I said this the other evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| because my family had a very vested interest in a very big property on Sevier Avenue for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| and it's no longer ours, and that's been very regrettable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| But South Knoxville I love very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And to see it come out of that stagnant, dying stage is just very exciting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5241)|
| 1:27:30| Consequently, I just think it's going to, this is going to be a long-term project, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5250)|
| 1:27:39| And I think some of you all are ready to jump on it and be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| And I'm so grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| And you have indicated that you are anxious to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| And we want to make that very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Consequently, this word flexible, to me, because it reads differently to me than it does to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| is a real reassurance that we can still be there to assist you in achieving some of the goals that you hope to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5279)|
| 1:28:09| with some of the developers that you will be working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| And I think this council is very flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| I think this community has demonstrated that they really support the flexibility that is built into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| And I could not support the plan if it were not for the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| I mean, that is a crucial, because over a period of 20 years, many things are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| The dynamics, the economic stability of the city and the country and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| We have no crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| So we just have to, we have to have a flexible plan, in my opinion, which will speak to your needs and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| You know, I thought your comments about parking were so important, because I haven't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| I don't think I have really given enough consideration to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| So I appreciated you commenting on the parking issue and some of the information that you gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| and the discussion that we were able to have back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| And this is probably not worth anything to anybody, but I just want to mention it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| because I thought that the comments that the gentleman made to us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| well, one comment was public-private parking, shared parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| And that's an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| But I also think shared use of parking is a very important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| I'm really involved right now in a development that's in my district out west on not a very large tract of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5379)|
| 1:29:47| but a very, very expensive tract of land that has to be maximized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| So I understand a developer's need to maximize, particularly where there are a lot of issues with the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| And this one has had major issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| It's right built up just at the edge of a quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| But, you know, it's exceptional what they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| They are building a hotel and an office building, which are just almost one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| And they're going to break ground on that this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| The parking there is shared between the office building and the hotel for the very reason that was expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| Nighttime parking needed for the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Daytime parking needed for the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| But it's an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| I just think there's so many creative developers out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| Because somebody told me this week when I wanted to know why the Crystal was no longer in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| and I was very disappointed, he said, your dirt's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| And I know dirt is expensive right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| He said, Kingston Pike dirt is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Tell him I can find some cheap dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| So we're looking for cheap dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| But, you know, I understand all of the issues that are before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| And I understand your obligation to your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| But I really do totally believe that this council is committed to seeing you develop your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5469)|
| 1:31:19| I believe that those who have crafted this plan over this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| I believe this administration is totally committed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| We have a public official whose only real responsibility right now is to see this plan grow and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5488)|
| 1:31:36| and be very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| And so, you know, I as one, if I vote to approve the plan as it's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| and we've already voted on it in first reading, I will personally commit to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| and I believe everyone on this council would commit to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| that we would work with you in every way for you to achieve your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| Because when you achieve your goals, the city of Knoxville achieves its goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| And the community of South Knoxville achieves its goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| So, you know, we're all in this together, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| And we're all partners in wanting to see something wonderful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| And you've demonstrated that you do wonderful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| So that is very exciting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| And I'm so glad that you're going to be a partner of ours in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| But I hope you understand some of the philosophy that some of us may be wrestling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| in deciding whether to commit to this as it was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| But I'll use my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| I appreciate the opportunity to come and listen tonight and for everybody's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| I think it's been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| And I really want to commend Councilman Hulquist for all that he's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| and really who I think is uniquely qualified to, at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| to someone that understands all the little nuances and the technicalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| in working with Mr. Hill and the consultants and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| And I think it's you've done a great job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| And I appreciate you asking the specific question here earlier and the back and forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| Mr. Prince, I think you've helped me a lot in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| And I wish we had had this discussion a lot earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| You know, I almost feel like the clock's running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| And Rachel Craig and Carol, for your comments and going on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| and speaking to the neighborhood sort of standpoint that, as we move along, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| the flexibility issue, which I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| And Mr. Hill's talked quite a bit to me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| And, you know, and then the balancing point and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| And this is, you know, one of the biggest things that's come along in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| And I think we need to be very careful how we go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Having said that, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| Mr. Hill or whoever, I get the feeling that in order to take advantage of this process that's laid out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5644)|
| 1:34:12| if you get in early, you know, there's some advantages to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| There's the public participation, the parking and some things we've heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Well, in every case it's going to be project specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| In some cases it may be assistance in terms of or participation in terms of purchasing land for a piece of a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5670)|
| 1:34:39| or constructing a piece of the river walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| In other places it may entail starting to work out the partnership for a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| So it just depends on what is needed to support that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| And at that point it turns into a negotiative process where the result is a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| So, I mean, the thing that I've learned in terms of how this works is that if the city has a commitment to some financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5702)|
| 1:35:13| participation, you wait and find out what the needs of that project are before you start trying to set anything in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| So we'd like to hear, you know, what the project intent is and what is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| And we definitely want to fall in behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| For example, if Mr. Pins is on his property and he's got a bonafide hotel developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5730)|
| 1:35:39| I would hope the first thing we do is we start, and they say parking is a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| the first thing we do is we say we've got a parking problem to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| So what are the options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| You know, is there a surface lot that can be used temporarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Do we need to start working on a public parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| You know, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Or do we look at a variance in terms of the alternative compliance in terms of the maximum number of parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| That's where we start really trying to figure out what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| I will take some responsibility for this alternative compliance review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| because in my years in the planning sector, all in local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| I get so tired of everybody thinking they can write a perfect zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| And the reason I asked the consultants to put that in there was because you can never anticipate every little nuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5785)|
| 1:36:35| or subtlety in a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And I wanted to have an escape valve for developers that traditionally have to beg their case before a BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| where you have to demonstrate hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| That's the reason that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| So I wanted to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| It's not flexibility intended to lessen the predictability for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| It's intended to give them a relief valve so that they don't have to go through traditional routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| that are not built for providing some relief when we can't, we're not smart enough to do a perfect code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5825)|
| 1:37:14| Well, and my second question was really what you just answered is really how do you feel about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| And I really appreciate the, I'm a lot more comfortable with the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| I originally thought between the first reading and the second that some of the issues that have been raised to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| might could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| But really, as the process unfolds, that's the beauty of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| So that's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Is there anyone else from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| And then after that we'll go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Well, Gail, I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| And I probably should have said what I'm getting ready to say earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| You know, for 30-something years I've dealt with developers all over Knoxville on projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| And I know what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| I know what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| And I know what their problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| But what I want to, I'm going to mention my stepbrother, who Ms. Pelow, I think, knows very well, Earl Worsham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| And Earl was the largest developer, one of the largest developers to ever come out of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| High Regency, two or three dormitories at UT, Knoxville College, housing projects, the convention center in Miami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5898)|
| 1:38:28| all over the Virgin Islands, 18 projects in Moscow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| And the list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| But I've been around Earl for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| And when a developer comes in and looks at the book we've got on the coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| we're still, I think, just too restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| And I think you ought to have the alternative supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| But when my brother looks at a project or another developer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| they don't just come in and say, well, we want to build ten stories instead of five stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| Before they come in, they're going to hire an architect and start making drawings to see what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| They're going to get their financial people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| They're going to talk to bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| They're going to hire attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| They're going to get their people working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| They're going to spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| And if we have this thing too restrictive, you know, they've got other places they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| There's other cities that have got similar projects to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| And the larger developers work a lot of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| If they come in and see a too restrictive, you know, five stories, maybe seven stories for wedding cake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5968)|
| 1:39:37| Mr. Parkin's a problem, like Mr. Prenn said, when they look at it, maybe they end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| You know, they may not even go to the alternative or the procedures that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| You may not even get to talk with them because if they think that that's kind of our mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| they're probably going to start spending a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| wasting time talking to their bankers, their attorneys, their architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| because they can't just come in and start talking about a project without spending some money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| That's my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| I just want to take a minute to respond and to thank the council for your kind words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| and for your support and for listening to our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| If it turns out that on second reading you decide to adopt the code the way you have in the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6029)|
| 1:40:39| I very much appreciate the opportunity, as you said, to sit with all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| and bring a developer in to you, Joe, to you, Dave, and to David Gamble, to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6045)|
| 1:40:55| And I hope you don't mind if I bother you a lot from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| because I really do think that something wonderful can happen here on the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| and I certainly would like to be able to present that opportunity to the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| with your commitment to sit down with that developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and really work with that developer to make it economically feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| as well as aesthetically pleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| as well as providing the access to the riverfront that the city has not had over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| So, again, thank you for the kind words, and thank you for the opportunity to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| We thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| I want to let you have the last word, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I just want to respond to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| I really appreciate you saying that, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| And you have my commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| I can't necessarily give you 100 hours a week, but I will give you my time, my focus, my consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6110)|
| 1:41:59| And I think we don't know each other well, but we've been around each other enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| I think you know I'm very serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| And you have my commitment to doing just exactly what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Anyone else from the public who is here with us today that wishes to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| We're not hearing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| I was joking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Come on, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Thirty seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| The only thing I wanted to say was that by no stretch of the imagination do I feel that Mr. Prins, Mr. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| anybody needs to apologize for voicing their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| We don't consider them counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| We do not consider them to be obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| And we're going to continue having whatever dialogue it takes to try to get the problem solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| Excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| And I want to commend the administration and the council for the first district in understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| in doing this workshop what we're doing is just that, continuing the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| and trying to make what is a very good plan an even better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| And because it is flexible, because it has certain unique qualities about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| I hope we all realize that in order for it to truly be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| we must continue the discussion and the debate and the public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070223?start=6198)|
