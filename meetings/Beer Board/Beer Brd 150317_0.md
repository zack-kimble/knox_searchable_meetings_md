| 0:02:25| I got the LLC about an hour ago, and I have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=149)|

| 0:02:33| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Do you like two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| Background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| It's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| But he had that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Does he have that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| No, you haven't done the background check, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| They were supposed to be FedEx, and we hadn't received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Ms. Robinson said he has the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| He does have the fingerprints in front of me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Do you have the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Is that separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| But you don't have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| The background check was I emailed that to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| That was part of the package that I had with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I do have it at the location, but that was emailed to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| You don't have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Excuse me, I did get those, Tracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| but you had told me that you were getting those FedEx,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| so I didn't do anything with it, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| So what are we missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| We're missing the LLC and the former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| And he has the former permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| And you have the former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Yes, I do have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| But we don't have the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| and the fingerprints, Brian, yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| We've got the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| We've got the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| But we don't have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Is that something we could take a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| or put them to the hill and go upstairs and get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Go up and get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Yes, I guess we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Yeah, I mean, we can go print the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| and you can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Or do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| I'll make a motion we move him to the hill, the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| and this will give hopefully somebody some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| to go up there and get it and bring it back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| And move pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Well, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I'll second, Mr. Padless, Mayor Padless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Because we want to see the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| before we approve it, so that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Yeah, I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| And as I was looking through the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| the other day, the checklist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| it makes it very clear that before this fear board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| will consider your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| you need to have the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| and the fingerprints submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| So we had a little discussion about that previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| and as long as that's on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| we'll need to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| So what we will do is at the end of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| the fear board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| we will have the documentation we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| and we'll bring your case back up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=292)|

| 0:05:02| Might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=303)|

| 0:07:57| My name is Mahesh Kumar Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| The address is 2310 East Magdala Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Mr. Patel has a conviction for sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| sale of alcohol to a minor, March 28th of 2013 in Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| And could you explain to us how that will affect this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| The conviction renders him incapable of holding a beer permit per state law for 10 years from the date of conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| So do you understand that because of that conviction in Jackson, we cannot issue a beer permit to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| Another person, who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| It's my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=521)|

| 0:08:43| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Do you have the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Has she had the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Yes, she does not have any record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| So, Mr. Patel, you can't hold the permit at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| and we need to have you removed from this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| before we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150317?start=540)|
