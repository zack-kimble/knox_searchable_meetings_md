| 0:08:46| eight houses within 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| But since it, in effect, has been grandfathered in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| we have to go ahead, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=535)|
| 0:08:55| I just want to make that clear that everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=538)|

| 0:09:11| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Just curious as to why you're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| on and off premises, how is that going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| It has an outside service window, a drive-thru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| and for food and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I'd like to keep it in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| It's nothing new to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Make sure that you're very aware of who's buying beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| We've had that discussion before about drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And you know your liability if you can't see somebody walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| And part of the reason we like people to walk in the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| is you can see their gate and their stagger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| And so be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| And we'll be checking those drive-thrus as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=594)|

| 0:13:06| to the front of the agenda where the violations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| And I hope you've taken time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| It's going to take a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| And to give you a heads up, right at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| we will suspend this meeting, open commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| suspend it, and reopen this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| And that's just for the law director's desire there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=804)|

| 0:14:11| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| What our procedures are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| we will be calling the Sheriff's Department up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| to present the facts of the allegations against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| The officer will state what he believes to be the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Afterward, we will ask whether you affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| You will have an opportunity then to testify on your behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| for this board before the board actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| makes a decision in your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| So at this time, I'm going to be calling on Captain Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| May to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| First off, I think he has a general statement he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| would like to make to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=884)|

| 0:14:49| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Just to give you a heads up, on April 7th, 8th, and 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Knox County Sheriff's Vice Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| along with agents from Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| conducted a beer and liquor sting throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| The reason we did this was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| of graduation and a prom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| We checked 118 businesses and cited 16 for beer sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| and three for liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=918)|

| 0:15:22| We appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| And now to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| OK, this is a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| On 4-9, 2015, cited an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| that worked at the bread box who bought a 25 ounce can of Bud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| Please state your name for me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Pete Tricarico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Tricarico?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Tricarico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Tricarico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Mr. Tricarico, how do you plead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Now this is your opportunity to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| your side of the situation to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| If you have anything you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| to say before they deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| The cashier did fail to offer the proper services by policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| They failed to properly ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And the employee has since been terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| because we have a zero tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| for failing tobacco or alcohol stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| The company has since installed scanners at the registers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| to ensure proper IDing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We offer an every month training course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| And all new employees are trained on computer training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| and testing on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| That is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| I'll make a motion for a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Sam, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| Looking at the numbers, that's about 16.5% of you all failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| Really, what you failed at is being good stewards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| protecting our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That's what you failed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| And I know you all come up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| well, we fired the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| You fired the person because you got caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| That's why you fired the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| I just question what your day-to-day activities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| I'm not accusing you of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| but I do question them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| When we have 16.5% fail, and you come up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| well, we fired the employee, we go through all this training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| well, it sounds like maybe there's something else going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Maybe there's a profit margin somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| But this is disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| You all, I'm not trying to shame you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| but you ought to be ashamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| I understand profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I understand business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| But we're talking about selling alcohol to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| during the prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| We've all heard the horror stories about prom season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| and drunk driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| We know our kids can't handle that, but you sell to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Oh, it's difficult. It's not difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Looking at them, we've been through what the licenses look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1118)|
| 0:18:38| It is not difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| So I just question all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I know we're going to hear it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We're going to hear it all today, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But I'll just make that general statement, and I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| But I'm very disappointed during this season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| for us to have such a high failure rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| And to be quite honest, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| whether $500 is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| I know we can go more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| I'll put that out for the commissioners to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| But I think even though it's first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I think $500 is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| of a fine of $1,000 for this first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| We have a motion, a substitute motion for a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Or is there a suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| You're giving them the option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1174)|

| 0:21:42| retake the ABC class so they know the correct way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| to check an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Because like they said, this is very disappointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| that this is this many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| When I got the list, I was shocked that this many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| were in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1313)|

| 0:22:34| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny and give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1357)|

| 0:22:41| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1361)|
| 0:22:41| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| On April 8, 2015, did an underage beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| staying at 7657 Clinton Highway lease Food Mart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| and purchase a 25-ounce can Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Ms. Miller, do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| And this is your opportunity to present your case to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| On April 8, my employee, Michael Sotch, did sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| After watching the video, he did not ask for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| He also, our computer system is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| and it prompts you to put in a birth date, at which point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| he bypassed and never put in a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| and let the beer go out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| He was then immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Anything else you'd like to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| We are now daily checking to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| that they are entering a birth date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| and not the exact same one every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| nor are they bypassing the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Commissioner Orloby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| I'm kind of on the same lines as Sam, in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| I think firing an employee is, especially on a first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| it's kind of like a way out for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| I think everybody deserves that second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Now, in this case, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| The man didn't even ask for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| That's just totally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| But I mean, I've seen incidents in four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| that people have looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| They've just punched in the wrong number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| or just mislooked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And those are mistakes I think need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| This last one, we've set a precedence now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| that the fines are going to be larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| because this is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I mean, 16%, that's prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| That's a lot of teenagers out here driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And it's just time to really make it serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| And I know it's not totally on y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Y'all can only give so much training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| But still, these people need to understand how serious this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| It's not just losing a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| They could seriously cause some damage to some families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1510)|
| 0:25:10| Commissioner Skinner-Maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| This is your second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| What was the situation for your first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| a year ago at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| It was the exact same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I had just taken over as manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| And the employee, I believe, had not asked for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| And he did not punch a day in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Did he stay employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| No, he was terminated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| You know you can put in computer systems and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| But do you ever send somebody by just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| to check to see if they're doing their job before the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| come by and do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I mean, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| That's something I think more stores need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1549)|

| 0:33:01| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1981)|
| 0:33:01| We got a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1983)|

| 0:33:08| JNR Incorporated, owner of First Offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1988)|
| 0:33:19| Would you state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Richard Armstrong, 9427 Kodak Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| Do you need somebody else to handle this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Relation, are we really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| There's a lot of similarities, since the names are identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Anyway, Richard, you've heard of the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| I'm going to call Wolfie May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| On April 7, 2015, went to quick service mark, 8756 Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Highway, and purchased a 25 ounce Bud Light Platinum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Moving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Richard, you have an opportunity to affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| He did do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| This is your opportunity to talk to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| The board, I've known him all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| and he's got two recommendations where they checked him before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| And he did check the ID, and he was real busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| selling lotto tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| And he said, as soon as that boy walked through the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| he realized that he had made a mistake reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| We had a little piece of paper there, and he made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And he goes out the door and tries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| to tell him he can't, he's got to bring the beer back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And Mr. May said it was too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| He'd already sold him the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| No, he didn't talk to him, and he didn't pay up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| He didn't talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| He just said he told him that it had already been by purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| that he couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Yeah, and that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Yeah, and that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Yeah, that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Yes, that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2094)|
| 0:34:54| So I just want to make sure that sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| So he knows that he said he just looked at it wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| and he realized it as soon as he'd walked away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| that he'd looked at it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Do you think your store had two previous no sales and letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| from the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Yes, I've got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Yes, with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| They've also been cited in the past also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2119)|
| 0:35:19| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Then not within the three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Can you bring the microphone to you there, Rolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| They've had past sales also and been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| Commissioner Ormby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| You said he looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Did he punch a number in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Sir, we don't have one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| We just checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2144)|
| 0:35:44| We got a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| We got the date on it, and he looks at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| And he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| He just made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| That's all it was to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I mean, he checks out all IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I got a 76-year-old woman that checks out IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I mean, that's not that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| He just made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| That's what I thought happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2166)|
| 0:36:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I move the $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2167)|

| 0:36:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Sir, you want the $1,000 fine or the 60-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2183)|

| 0:36:34| USA, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| First offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| My name is Tyo, T-A-Y-O, Atanda, A-T-A-N-D-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| I'm an attorney at the law firm of Boone McAllister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Norton in Nashville, Tennessee, attorney for Murphy Oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2209)|

| 0:36:58| Nashville, Tennessee, 37219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Now, did you stand up when they swore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| when our law director swore the folks in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I believe under the rules of professional responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| I'm already an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| And I probably am already sworn to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| OK, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| You will not be testifying on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2242)|
| 0:37:22| Or are you testifying on their behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| He's represented as an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| I'm representing them as an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| You have seen the procedure here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I will be calling the Sheriff's Department for the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| And then you will have an opportunity to affirm or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| on behalf of your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| On April 8, 2015, conducted an underage beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| sling at Murphy Oil, 8616 Fork Station Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| 24-ounce can, Miller lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| You heard the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| You have an opportunity now to address this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| on your client's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Just very quickly, I want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| to let the board know that this incident happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| It was very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And Murphy Oil is doing everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| it can to make sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Just a brief background on what Murphy Oil was currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| doing when this event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| And also, just to let the board know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| the employee that actually did the sale to minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| I'd already given it a two-week notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| And so the sale to minor occurred a week and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| before that two-week notice was left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| So she was already on her way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| But just a couple of things about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Murphy Oil is already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| We've already expensed or placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| in a technology, like the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| mentioned earlier on, which is the scanner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| allows you to simply take an ID, scan it, and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| sure you get the right age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| And in this instance, that just didn't happen at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| We don't understand why it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| But I think this is a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| we had an employee that was already on her way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| And she just didn't really care that much about making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| that alcohol is properly sold within the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| But even beyond that, though, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| what Murphy Oil does regularly is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| that they have a couple of measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| to make sure that their employees are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| selling to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| For example, they have a room in the airports in Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| where they pretty much pay about three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| to look at their camera all day, at their stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| all across the country, to make sure that their employees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| not bypassing the system that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And moreover, the manager at each store, including this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| checks the camera every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| to make sure that employees are not bypassing the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| that they currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| And if an employee does that, they get written up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| So again, we don't know why this really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| happened in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| But we're doing every single thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| that we can to make sure this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| And of course, right when this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| the employee was terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And so we didn't even give her the week and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| that she had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Murphy Oil is a publicly traded company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| They have about 335 stores all across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| that sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| And they have less than a 2% failure rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| when it comes to compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| So we really deeply regret this situation happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| And additional measures that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| taking to make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| So like I said, this is not even a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| where the employee imputed the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| So what we've done is placed signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| by the register, which I've got a copy of it right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| with me, just to remind employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| that when you're checking someone for the sale of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| you have to make sure that you scan the ID before you actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| So again, putting up signs to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| sure we encourage them to use the technology that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| And moreover, we are actually also making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| employees sign a server responsibility statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| which basically they have to sign periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| to remind them that if they do sell to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| they'll be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| And they also have a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| to make sure they're not selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| In addition to that, we are continuing the monthly training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| that we have for all servers to make sure that, again, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| remind them of the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| to not sell alcohol to a minor, and to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| that they're doing whatever they can to follow the company's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| So again, I think we really deeply regret this happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| And I know it is within this board's discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| to issue a fine or a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| And we'd like to ask the board to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| the minimum fine of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And the area manager actually has a word for the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| and I'll let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| I promise to take as little time as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| My name is John Dykler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I am the national category manager for all alcohol sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| within Murph USA nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| As Tayo had already indicated, Murph USA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| is a publicly traded company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| We have over 1,268 stores nationwide, 335 of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| sell alcohol and fall underneath my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Murph USA spends an awful lot of time and energies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| preventing days just like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| It's not a fun thing to stand in front of partners and neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| such as yourselves and have to explain ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| That's why we take the steps to provide the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| That's why we make sure that every single employee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| seller-certified using an online certification program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| sellerserver.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| That's also why we have a third-party company that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| does monthly stings at all of our stores each and every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| and reports back to us where opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| exist so that we can follow up and further train our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I doubt very much that there are many companies nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| that take this as seriously as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| And we don't do it to be profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| We're a large company, but we still operate very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| as a small company, a small Arkansas company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Because our primary concern is we want to be your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| We want to be part of your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| And neighbors look after each other's kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| It's very disappointing that our staff members failed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| I drove over 10 hours last night so that I could be here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| just so you can see my face when I said I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| And we don't want to have this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| We appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| And we look forward to meeting and exceeding your expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| in the years to come as we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| to grow alongside you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Anything else, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2630)|
| 0:43:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Mr. Chairman, back two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| there were several of us on this board who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| sat with a committee to try to look at combining city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| and county beer laws and look at who was doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| And it was pointed out to us at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| that Murphy was one of the leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| in the whole industry as far as training for their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| We had one of their local folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| was on the panel with us part of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| And I was impressed by what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And a 2% failure rate is pretty doggone good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2673)|
| 0:44:43| I'd like to break precedent on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and recommend and make a motion that we give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| $500 fine or 30 days suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| And it is Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| And while I applaud you all, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| do applaud the fact that you all are showing your commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| by your presence, I'm not convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2708)|
| 0:45:18| I'm not convinced in that what if that 2% got out on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| and flipped their own car, flipped someone else's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I'm not impressed because you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| what happens during prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| You all are a national outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| You all understand prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| You guys, more than anyone, understand nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| what happens during prom season, especially with our minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| So I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| that we institute a $1,000 fine or 60 day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| The motion we're voting on now is the $1,000 fine, 60 day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=2768)|

| 0:56:05| I went straight right there, and he checked it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3365)|

| 0:56:12| But now we already changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| The register have to have a put in key in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3373)|

| 0:56:22| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| I make a motion for the fine of $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3384)|

| 0:56:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3396)|
| 0:56:36| So you have the option of a 60-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| or a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3400)|
| 0:56:40| $1,000 fine is to be paid to the Knox County Clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Office within seven days, or we can come for your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I should have asked this question earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| before some of these that we've already fined had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| But since we've ramped up the fines from $500 to $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| that means the second phase of the fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| now get ramped up considerably, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| So I need to be taking that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| They could be coming back here with a $5,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| For those of you that are coming into the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| we are currently still in our beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| and we'll be for a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| But at 5 o'clock, we will halt this beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| start the county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| halt the county commission meeting immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| and pick back up on the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| So we will be after 5 o'clock with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3455)|

| 1:06:08| and his talking a good game and really not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| I think Wolfie had something, so I didn't want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Go ahead, Mr. Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| Officer, stay a minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| This business is kind of like a smoke and mirror business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| where we change every time I cite someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| in the family takes over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| and they just keep moving it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| to different people in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| They get a new beer permit, we cite them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| they change hands again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| So I guess my question to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| is is Brad proper even though the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| or the representative is not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Can we pass that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Well, where we are on this, this is a judicial hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| It's up to the, basically, this body is the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| They have had proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| They have given an opportunity to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| and they understand what the charges are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| If they fail to attend, then it's up to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| how you want to rule concerning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| He has sent someone as his agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| whether he's an employee or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Now, is that immediate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Okay, so right now, Wolfie will go pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| I have no one to formally affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| The facts are before this board to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| The option as to how you want to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| is up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| I'm gonna make a motion to suspend the beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Second. No option of a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| And that's being done in absence of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| and a beer permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| So, Wolfie, will you proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| if the vote's affirmative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| will you proceed to pick up the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| and take care of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Can we not add a fine to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| I guess we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Mine was gonna be even harsher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| I wanted a $5,000 fine or a six-month suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| We tried 120 days on a third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| and we lost that in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| It's kind of been set, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| And you can't get a $5,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| I think 2,500 is the maximum civil offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| So, that's as bad as it can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| Well, I'd like to amend it for a $2,500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| and the max on suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Well, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| if we do this, will it hold up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I want to do something that's gonna hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| So, if we go both fine and suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| we've never done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| and I don't want to get this thrown out in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| So, that's my only caution to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| is they can appeal this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| and as he said, we tried to get to 120-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| That was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4129)|
| 1:08:49| So, I'd like to get something that'll stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| He'd have to show up for the appeal, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| Well, he would have to file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| What would happen is he would have to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| in Chancery Court, and the one on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| we had 120-day suspension on a third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| and it got thrown out at 93 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| So, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Well, I'll just point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I'd rather be a very stiff penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| and fine, and the suspension of the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| and take a chance on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| it gets thrown out or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| because it has to come back here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Okay, well, this is the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| It doesn't come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4168)|
| 1:09:28| It comes to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Okay, well, I'm fine with it being at the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| but this address, whoever is running it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| needs to get our, they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| we need their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| We have a, okay, Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Yeah, well, this is the same one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| a year and four months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| that changed from the father to the son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| The father was fixing to pass away, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| It's been, I think, between father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| maybe two brothers, a sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4198)|
| 1:09:58| Last time we were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I think there was a sister applied for a permit, and-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Six times in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| That's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| That is, there needs to be a message sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| and I agree with Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| I take our chances in the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| and if it gets thrown out, it gets thrown out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| but I'd rather send a strong message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| All right, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Who's seconded the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Commissioner McKenzie, you got something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| No, she's seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| She's seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| No, she's seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4231)|
| 1:10:31| I seconded yours, but-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Okay, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Sam, or do we need a second on the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| I'll second it, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| $2,500 fine and a 60-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| and this is being done to remind you and the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| that this has been done in the permit holder's abstentia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| because he's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| and he doesn't have a legal representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| so Wolffield will execute this as soon as feasibly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Captain, will you, he's got a 60-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| and even after the 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| if he hadn't paid the $2,500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I would imagine he couldn't get his beer permit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| Seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4271)|
| 1:11:11| So, he's already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| You don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I'd say he's making a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| He's on the back office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4277)|
| 1:11:17| How fast will he-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| You can notice him seven days to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| He's right on the back office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| How fast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Well, he's not, the owner's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4283)|

| 1:12:19| or to tell this board anything you wish for them to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Actually, I just bought the store, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| and it was afternoon time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| when my wife bought the lunch for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| so I said to take care of a couple of customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| and I was sitting on a side and eating my lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| and I was watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| And she did check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| but the thing she didn't check is the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| She affirmed the year that was right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| but she didn't check the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| And even the system is pretty much new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| because usually I'm used to the Ruby Register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| and over here it is, it's the touch screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| But I still do make sure that whoever employee I hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| they have their beer permit and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| And I've been through the beer training and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I make sure my employees go through there, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Move $1,000 fine, 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Second, but I'd also like to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| this is the second or third time we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| they looked at the year, but not the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| And Captain Mays told me she was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| How can you be off three years on a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| and it's a lame excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| No, it was 94 when she saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Yeah, it was a different person on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| A different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| All right, the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| is a 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Oh, I just wanted to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| you don't even have to look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| It's on the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| It's on the license, the red line or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| You don't have to do the mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| you don't have to know the month or the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| you just have to look at that license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| and it tells you right there with that red line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| whether it's legal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Actually, she doesn't work at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| She just watches me, and sometimes she helps me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| She's a housewife, she doesn't work over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| Oh, Wolfie, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| I was just gonna follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| All of my underage people's ID have the red stripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| that says under 21 until whatever their 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| You do not have to do math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| you don't have to look at the birthday or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| It tells, if you look at the card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| over half of the people that I've cited never checked ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4473)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4477)|
| 1:14:37| Okay, you have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| for a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Sir, you have an option of a $1,000 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I'll pay the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| All right, seven days to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| or we can come for your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Bill Feathers, 10535 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Webb Bound, Incorporated, on our first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| Can you give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| for the record, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| It's Art McCammon, 213 Wakefield Road, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| Mr. McCammon, you have seen the procedure here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| I will call Captain Wolfie May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| who will make the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| You will have an opportunity to affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| or deny those allegations to give this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| This is kind of unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Actually, we actually bought beer and liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| and ABC was along with our staining operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| so they took care of the liquor violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| and I've got the beer violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| On April 9th, 2015, Bull Feathers, 10535 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| my underage was served a Miller Lite at the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and was also able to purchase a liquor drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| Mr. McCammon, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| This is your opportunity to testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| and give your side of the story before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| And not knowing what to expect today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| and all of the commissioners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I did prepare a handout for the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| to review while I'm going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| I'll be brief because I know we're kind of backed up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| and I don't know the proper way to get it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Get a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Commissioners, chairman, vice chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I'm here before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| because I am the owner of Bull Feathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| and my business was cited on April 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| for sale of beer to someone who was under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| This was done by one of my employees, Hannah Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| and is completely contrary to how we conduct business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| It was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| It was against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| It is inexcusable for that I am sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| and will do everything in my power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| to be sure that it never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I've owned Bull Feathers for 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| and this is the first time we've been cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| for underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Not that that is in any way acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| but I believe our track record of the dozen years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| would indicate that this is not a pattern of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| The fact that it did happen raised many concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| and questions about our dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| to enforcing the letter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| In addition, you may ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| is this a common practice at Bull Feathers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Do we look the other way to underage drinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| Has the staff not been made aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| of the consequences of underage serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| Are we worthy of your trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| to responsibly serve beer in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| First, I assure you, I have put out memos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| some of which the chairman now has up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| which are part of the materials in my handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| These memos go out on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| and address all aspects of responsible serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| underage serving, stings or busts in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| over serving, visible intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| and the consequences of not complying with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| In spite of that, I still failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| to stop what happened on April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| I've watched the video of the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| and I am frustrated and confounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| by the fact that the employee did not check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| The reality is she was checking the text on her phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| just prior to the customers coming in and sitting down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| and although, and believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| I understand that we are guilty of this violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| she put the beer, she never actually received the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| and she did not check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| which is thoroughly unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| I've taken the following actions to address the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| and drive home the message as strongly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| Hannah Powell, as all other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| apparently here today, have been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| As a condition of their continued employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| all of our servers will attend a TABC class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| at Bullfeathers the first week of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| All servers have filled out a form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| which is actually in the back of the handout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| All of my employees sat down and wrote out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| have they been informed of all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| that I have talked about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| and then they also were asked to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| to the commissioners and the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| on behalf of Bullfeathers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| because you don't want them all standing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| but I wanted them all to get the sense of what it is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| to stand in front of a judgmental body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| and feel the consequences of their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| We are putting a renewed emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| on focusing on fundamentals, turning off the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| and leave your personal problems at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I thank you for your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and may we never meet this way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Now, one more thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| and I've heard this several times today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| and I'm gonna go over this very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| because I know there's a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| waiting for other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| I passed out this memo in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| It's an easy way to card in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| and it speaks to the issue of the stings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| that are going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| They signed this right here in bold letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| convicted the server or bartender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| to not work in the industry for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| I couldn't make it any stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I've heard talk about the picture of the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| with the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| They were handed this handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| They saw that you don't have to be a rocket scientist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| or a mathematician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| All you have to do is see red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| which is, of course, what I did after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| We passed out information on false IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| to the company out of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| that has also affected underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| This is what's called shouting on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| You can see the red letters, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| from your side of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| This was the memo that went out the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| So page after page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| dealing with stings that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| local news stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| 50 signs of visible intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| We have these distributed in our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| that talks about first-time DUI offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| So I understand we have done wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| and I accept the penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| that you meet out here to me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| but I also feel that I needed to take a moment of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| to try to express as firmly as I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| that I am doing my best with the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| even though we failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| to get the message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4944)|
| 1:22:24| I kind of wish you would have been first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| although a lot of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| would have done well to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Motion is a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Commissioner Albee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I applaud what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| and I think it's wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| and I agree with the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| that I wish you would have been the first one to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| and then maybe people would understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| the severity of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| because we're talking about young teens' lives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| That will affect a lot of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| if something was to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| I applaud what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| I understand that you're taking this very serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| and you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| It's just today was not the good day to appear here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| because it's gonna have repercussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| and hopefully, I don't feel we'll see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| But I'll also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| she may have been texting on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| but you didn't address the liquor sale as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Was it two texts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Again, I applaud you and what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| and I have every belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| that you're gonna do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| but I think this was more than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| an erroneous person with the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| I think there was a pattern there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| probably a single-person employee pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| but for two beverages to be sold is pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| Well, and to address, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| but to address that specific situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| the two gentlemen came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| and they were served both beverages at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| It was one transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| It was not two transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Not that that excuses it, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| We have a motion and a second for a 60-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Sir, which one do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Take the fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| We'll be to the clerk's office within seven days, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5065)|

| 1:24:31| VA group owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5071)|

| 1:24:41| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| Mr. Patel, you have seen the procedure today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Captain May will make the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| You will have an opportunity to affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| or deny those allegations and to give your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| On April 7th, 2015, conducted underage beer sting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| at USHOP number 27106, Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Purchased a 16-ounce Miller Lite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| when the underage person came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| with a citation or with a ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| it actually said it was rang up under tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| They scanned it, but they rang it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| as tobacco instead of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| Mr. Patel, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| This is your opportunity to give your side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| of the story to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| He made a mistake, he rang it up in the tobacco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| like what the Wolfie said, instead of in the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| he rang it up in the tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| He did check ID, he punched it in, in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Everything was fine, but he made a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| ringing it up into the tobacco instead of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| Is that a common practice at your store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| No, we usually scan everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| but that particular item did not scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| so he manually rang it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Wolfie, commissioner, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| That's one of the ways they get around the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| Placing the ID, the birth date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| They put the birth date, it shows that they're over 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| and they can ring the alcohol up under tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Do you get receipts on, do your folks get receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Wolfie, so that that could be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I have this receipt, and we get them if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| Well, I think that would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| if that's becoming a practice around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| That, to me, doubles the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Some places that knowingly sell underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| do not give the receipt, so that they can be traced back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| I bet the Board of Revenue at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| would like to see that, that tax on the tobacco and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Move $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Motion and a second, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| So you have a 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5240)|
| 1:27:20| All right, you have seven days to permit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| to the county clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| or we'll come pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| All right, before we stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| I was gonna, real quick discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Today was obviously heavy on the fines and the suspensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| but I would like to ask the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| David, to research, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Since we went up in the fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I think it would be wise, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| to see the letter out from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| in regards to the fines that we levied today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| and the amount going up, let them know the consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| and also maybe setting an ordinance or a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| to send 25% of the fines and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| to the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| to help fight underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| And so we'll have that discussion next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| and if they don't mind to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| Also like to commend Captain May and his group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| for doing an excellent job in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I mean, do it every month, Wolfie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| let's get them off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5300)|

| 1:28:22| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Is there anything before the body on the beer issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| All right, we're gonna adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| It's 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| If you guys don't mind, it's medically necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| for some of these guys to take a 10-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| so we're gonna reconvene at 5.40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| All right, we're going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5316)|

| 1:29:05| We're gonna do some moving on some items here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| in just a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| but we do have scheduled public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| and some of them are not on topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| I don't know, Ms. Dobbs, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And you're one to go during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Xavier Presley, you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5356)|

| 1:29:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| It's always next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I talked to him a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| All right, so Xavier's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| And Ronald Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Ronald Taylor here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| That eliminates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| And I have two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Mr. Silverstein has signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| but you wanna speak during that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| in regard to the resolution, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Either now or then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Your option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5383)|

| 1:29:45| Okay, come ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Just need your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| I'm here today to speak in support of Resolution 15.4902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| I'm a member of Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| an organization that includes representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| from many neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Community Forum recently became aware that in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| Knox County had opted out of state statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| which required annual training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| and continuing education for MPC commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| certain MPC staff, and BZA members, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| The city of Knoxville also opted out in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| When this matter came to our attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Community Forum immediately brought this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| to the attention of our elected officials and to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| We are pleased today the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| will consider this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| and tomorrow the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| will consider a similar resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| We wish to thank Commissioners Owen B. and Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| for sponsoring this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| We believe that this is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| It is crucial that all of our MPC commissioners and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| are kept fully informed about all aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| of the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| including any changes in state statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| and any state or federal court decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| which may have an impact on their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| The planning and decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| is often very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| for all those who participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| We believe that this required outside training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| will be of great benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| to not only those receiving this training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| but also for those in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| who participate in the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| and expect a fair, transparent, and meaningful process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| where local ordinances, regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| and state laws are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| While the cost of this training is quite minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| we believe it is a good investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| as it should produce a more efficient planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| with fewer delays, disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| and expensive and time-consuming litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Community Forum thanks you for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| and urges you to vote in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| Any questions of Mr. Schiff's time for release?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| We'll go through the honorary resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| and the first one we're gonna do is Resolution 15-4103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| Madam Clerk, if you'll read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| It's a resolution proclaiming April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| as Parkinson's Awareness Month in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5534)|
| 1:32:28| Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| progressive neurological disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| and it's the second most common neurodegenerative disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| and whereas there is inadequate data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| but it is estimated to affect 500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| to 1,500,000 people in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| and the prevalence will more than double by 2040,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5569)|

| 1:32:54| is the 14th leading cause of death in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| and whereas it is estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| that the economic burden of Parkinson's disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| is at least $14.4 billion annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5585)|

| 1:33:16| and whereas research suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| the cause of Parkinson's disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| is a combination of genetic and environmental factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| but the exact cause and progression of the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| is still unknown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| and whereas there is no objective test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5607)|

| 1:33:33| to slow or halt the progression of the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| and whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| vary from person to person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| and can include tremors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5620)|

| 1:34:03| and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| whereas increased research, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5644)|

| 1:35:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5702)|
| 1:35:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| There's a friend of mine who lives in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| and is active, and whether we disagree or agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| we're still friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| And he's one of the good guys to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| that'll listen to you and let you listen to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| and give you author good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| But I'll let you tell his story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| and we'll speak a little bit after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Go ahead, Al.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Dan, when you get a chance, come on over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| I don't really have much to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| other than to thank the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| and thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| I know how valuable your time is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| I do know that you vote on proclamations all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| and probably think of not too much of it about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| However, this is important to me and millions of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| who have Parkinson's disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| or there are care partners to someone who has the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| or they have a relative with Parkinson's or have a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| or they're just plain old taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| The costs are enormous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| much of which is borne by the federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| With this proclamation, Knox County has joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| other municipalities, state houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| and as an aside, I will say that former commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| Dr. Richard Briggs, now state senator Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| submitted the proclamation as his first official act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| in the state senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| And even the U.S. Congress is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| The reason is to promote awareness of the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| with awareness we hope the dollars for research will follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| so that one day we will find a cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| or even a way to slow the progression of the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Again, on behalf of the Parkinson's Action Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| the Parkinson's Disease Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| and the Parkinson's community in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| thank you so very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5807)|
| 1:36:58| What most of you know Dan just by being around the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| and we see him at every event we are at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| but Dan has lived with the disease for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| And he's probably, he submits his body and his time and his money and his efforts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| take tests for alternative measures to find a cure for his disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| And he's determined to fight it until he can't fight it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And, Dan, we appreciate that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=5850)|

| 1:40:59| and the discussion regarding the protocols for honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6059)|

| 1:42:31| Is that okay with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Let's go ahead and do the safety, family safety and emergency preparedness discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| Emergency preparedness was one of the hot topics of discussion at the latest NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6166)|
| 1:42:53| And when I was at the neighborhood conference a couple months ago, I was delighted to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6173)|
| 1:43:02| out we were having an emergency preparedness fair here in Knox County and wanted to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| them to come and give us a preview of what will be happening there and why we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| be interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Name and address for the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Ann Marie DeMose, 8829 Mill Run Drive, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6199)|
| 1:43:27| Bottom line is I'm here to ask for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| The family safety and emergency preparedness fair is on track to be hosted downtown at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| the World's Fair Park September 26th, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| It's an away game, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| So that was real important to get that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| I'm asking for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| And let me just give you a little bit of quick background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| The emergency preparedness fair in Knoxville stemmed from a small fair held at the Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| In 2011, the church partnered with East Tennessee VOAD, volunteer organizations active in disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| to collaborate on getting the message of emergency preparedness and disaster to a larger audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| The fair was held at Bearden High School with a tremendous turnout of about 1,500 to 2,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6256)|
| 1:44:23| Non-profits, government agencies, and emergency professionals came together to provide a wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| array of resources to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| Individuals in attendance were surprised at the diversity and the information they gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| by attending this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Volunteer organizations that comprise East Tennessee VOAD were thrilled that so many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| were reached in that community, in our community at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| With this success and the potential to continually impact large numbers of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| the decision was made to repeat the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| In 2012 and 2013, the fair was held at Cokesbury United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| Each year has seen significantly large crowds near that of the first year's attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| Due to the need for a larger venue and funding, the fair was postponed in 2014 to allow the fair board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| to adequately plan for a much larger location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| A committed group of individuals with the backing of Tennessee Federation of Fire Chaplains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| changed the name of the event to the 2014 Family Safety and Preparedness Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| in hopes to appeal to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| Our goal is to educate everyone by having interactive displays and information that target all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| We have scheduled the World's Fair Park for this annual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| This location, as you know, has the potential of reaching a much broader and larger base of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| More funding is needed to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| We feel this is a great service and much-needed annual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| With the recent winter storms in our state, one can easily understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| why these lessons need to be learned by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| The power outage that struck over 100,000 people a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| is another recent event that impacted many who were unprepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| And as you all know, we have many, many events in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| However, none prepares individuals and families to become more self-reliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| Cities and counties have huge responsibilities when emergency and disasters strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| This event helps to eliminate some of the strain by teaching the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| on how to better take care of themselves and assist their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| Some of the people who have committed already to bring their talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| and their resources and information and answer questions for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| We're covering dehydrated food preparedness, canning, pet safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| We're bringing on UT College of Veterinarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| They're coming in to talk about pet preparedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Of course, family food storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| KUB is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| They are going to talk about power outages, downed power lines, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| Of course, many, many of the emergency vehicles will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| We're going to teach people how to tarp their roofs in case trees topple over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| helping them out temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Emergency Prep 101, it's called Do One Thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| It's a really neat program that was started back maybe three or four years ago in Wisconsin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| and has gotten the attention of Washington, D.C., actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| I'm trying to get that into our fair as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| We have a number of people who are committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| We need the funding to cover World's Fair Park's venue costs, the electricity, the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6468)|
| 1:47:56| What else did they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| Oh, our banners, things of that nature, just to get it kick-started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| That's the very, very basic since we're going to try to do this thing is go big, go home is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| Will you email the commissioners what your estimated cost would be for that venue, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| That will kind of give us an idea of how we might be able to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Okay, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Commissioner Brolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| I'm willing to put in, if we can get a cost estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6498)|
| 1:48:26| I'm willing to contribute out of my discretionary funding to help cover the cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| because they're not charging anyone to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| If I remember correctly, you're not charging any of the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| We're not charging the vendors either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| We want as many people to get there as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| and the only way to do that because so many people are individuals, they're nonprofits themselves, churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| We don't want money to keep people away from presenting information for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| Right, and this is such a critical issue, and one of the biggest things I've heard, Adam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| especially the small business owners in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| is that the two weeks that they were basically shut down in February because of the weather really hurt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| So this is something that I'm really glad to see happening, and I'm happy to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| So when we get a final estimate of cost, I'm willing to chip in out of my discretionary funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| and I hope that the remainder of the commissioners will be willing to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| And thank you for coming to let us know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| How about waiving this, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| I think it's a great idea, but you said something about going big or going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| To me, this should be coming-something should be coming from Homeland Security, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| You didn't mention Red Cross or some of these other safety people that we have around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| the sheriff's department, the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| I know that we have had disaster and preparedness training here in this town before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| I don't remember who put it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| but I think there needs to be a combination of groups getting together to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| rather than just jump out and say, well, we're going to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| And there needs to be some coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| That's what I'm getting to the point at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| There is a lot of coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| The Red Cross will be involved, the sheriff's office, the fire department, rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| All of those folks are involved with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| I just didn't have the time to be able to explain who is all going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| but they will all be there, every one of them, Red Cross as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Red Cross isn't sponsoring it because we've become a 501c3 organization, but they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6644)|
| 1:50:53| We will be having CPR classes, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| We're going to have young folks there to help people download emergency apps on their phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| A lot of people don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| This is a very organized situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| When I say go big or go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| what I mean is we have been in little places and have had huge response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| and we're trying to get out to the regular people out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| helping them have a 72-hour emergency kit in their home or in their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| People really don't think about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| This isn't just a bunch of us trying to come together and saying, hey, let's go do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| We did not do it last year because Visit Knoxville approached us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| and said we need you guys to do this this year in 2014 downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| and we said we don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| We can't do this big venue with so few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| So we took the year off in order to pull all kinds of resources together for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| And I'm happy to email you all the people who are going to be involved if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| Some of these vendors should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| KUB should be very interested and willing to back it monetarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| if you can get information out to their customers that would help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| I haven't started that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| I've started with the county, the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| because it involves your people, your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| We want to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| We've got press kits put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| We've got PR, all the avenues for PR put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| It's just a matter of getting all this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Unfortunately, the businesses you mentioned like KUB, which I have not gone to yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| not everybody is going to be able to give us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| It's very difficult to ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| KUB as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| I haven't gone there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| This is going to, just to do the minimum, is $3,400 to $3,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| and that's the very bare minimum to rent the facility and have liability insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6769)|
| 1:52:57| We need to have custodial folks there from World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| There's just a lot that goes into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Brad, do you know who sponsored one a couple of years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| It was the same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| It's the same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| It's the exact same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| It's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| It's just growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| It's grown immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| A couple of things I want to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| First of all, let me preface by saying you said we're going to give you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| It's not our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| We get tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| So it's the people's money, which to me, this is a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| I lived in California for a while, and every household has an emergency kit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| I'm telling you, every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Yet here you don't, and I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| Because the last thing, if you wait until something happens, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| But I think it's a great thing that you're talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| I support it, and I'll be glad to give some money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| But I think instead of worrying about KUB or these other public entities where it's tax dollars or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| to me, I would take it to Walmart or people like that and have them prepare emergency kits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| that they could be selling them that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| They have a way to benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| So I think you really need a title sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Ed's an expert at finding title sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| It's the Walmart Family Safety Emergency Preparedness Fair or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| and I'll be glad to help out on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| But I think what you're doing is great, and I'll definitely be glad to give some money to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Go ahead, Hugh. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| I just want to let them know that the county has a process, a defined services process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| we go through every three years that is set up just for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| So if they'd like to get in touch with me, I'd love to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| Thanks, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| All right, next item we're going to cross off the list is Dr. McIntyre's report to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| or by Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| No, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| I want to acknowledge that one of our school board members, Patty Bounds, is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| I asked her if she wanted to come down and help me out, and she declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| But you have before you your quarterly report from Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| and I'll just walk you through it very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| You heard from Mr. Caldwell last week, and so you probably got a preview of a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| But if you look on basically what we look at each quarter is where we are in terms of revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| and then where we are in terms of expenditures in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| And if you look under revenues on the page that is listed as page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| you'll see that we are at total operating revenues right now of $323.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6957)|
| 1:56:06| That's 77% of budget and about on track to where we were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| I know Mr. Caldwell probably gave you some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| This is as of March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| He might have provided some more information that might be even more recent than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| But this is where we were as of March 31st and so continue to be on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| On page three, there is a projection that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| and it's sort of a consensus methodology that we've developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| and worked with county finance to refine over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| And you'll see that we see sales tax revenues looking fairly decent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| and a little bit above where we expect them to be at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| And then if you move on to expenditures on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| Hey, Doctor, before we move on to expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| can we talk about February sales tax that's yours yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Is that in this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Thomas is here as well, and he may be able to better define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| I don't believe so, and I think that's what I was talking about in terms of Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| having a little bit of information that might be just slightly more recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| I don't think it's as rosy as it was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. Bob Thomas, 912 South Gay Street, Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| There is a little bit more recent information than March 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| and Mr. Caldwell, of course, can talk more eloquently about it than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| but sales tax has actually gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| The collections did go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| I know Chris talked about the cold weather period we had in February there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| and I think Chris does his projections a little differently than we do ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| but according to Chris' projections, it's probably more closely to about $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| in terms of what we would project closing the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| rather than the $6.2 million that we're showing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| Of course, hopefully that will go back up some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| but that's a little more recent than the March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| So that's a projected sales tax increase, a surplus of $4 million after February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| Yes, sir, right there, $4 million over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| Sorry, Doc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| No, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Appreciate the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| And then if we move to expenditures on page 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| you'll see that we are at the total operating expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| We're at $270.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| That's about 64% of budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| and again pretty close to in line with where we were in fiscal year 2014 at this time as of March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| Generally speaking, on track both in terms of where we expected to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| both in terms of revenues and expenditures moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I would note that the Board of Education did adopt a fiscal year 16 budget recently of $441.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7122)|
| 1:58:52| and we are in the process of beginning to schedule individual meetings with each of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| so I won't take too much time to talk about that here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| but I'd love to spend some time with you and talk with you about the budget that the school board adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| and what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Basically there's just two priorities in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| One is to maintain the resources for our successful efforts around teaching and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| making sure that we continue to sustain the great work our teachers are doing in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| and two is actually to focus on significantly enhancing compensation for our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| So it's a 3% raise for teachers in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| and also maintaining the APEC strategic compensation initiative payouts that are scheduled for this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| So, again, I'm glad to spend a lot more time with each individual commissioner as we move forward in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| and answer all the questions that you may have, but in the interest of time I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| I'm going to talk to Chairman McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| and I think sometime after the mayor's budget proposal we will have a joint meeting with him in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| have dinner and discussion in regards to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| So I think that will kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| I was looking at the expenditures here, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| and there's one little issue I need to bring up, and as I've told you in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| District 7 is a passion of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| and there is a situation at Powell Middle School where there is a total room that has not been completely constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7211)|
| 2:00:21| and it shows on the budgetary process that the school has closed out that it was finished construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7221)|
| 2:00:29| and it's the room right behind the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| It looks like it should be the preparation room on the original plan for food preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| and it's a rock floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| It has no ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| It just has drop-down lights in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| and I was wondering if you could put that on your plan to finish that room for Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| Is it middle or elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Doug Dillingham is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| He's our supervisor of facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| and we'll ask him to address the question and give us a sense of where that might be in terms of future priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Doug Dillingham, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| The area you're talking about was designed when we did the cafeteria addition to Powell Middle School several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| and it was actually bid as an alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| trying to get not only the cafeteria but a full-service kitchen in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| We did include the shell of the space in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| but did not have the funding to complete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| When the Powell Middle School addition renovation was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| which was overseen by PBA several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| they also priced it as an alternate to include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| but it would not fit within the budget at that time either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| So consequently, it is a space that has been designed to become a full-service kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| It's just a matter of getting the funding to complete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| How long has the Powell Middle School renovation been completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| That sounds about correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| So in seven years we haven't found the funding yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7340)|
| 2:02:27| It's my understanding we're looking for somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 million to $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| to complete the construction process and also to purchase the equipment that it takes to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| But right now all they're using is that small little office space for food preparation now for the middle school, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| That I would have to defer to our food service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| I'm not certain exactly how they were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| I know at one time the food was being prepared at the high school and then brought over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| so I'm not sure how they're doing it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| You haven't seen the kitchen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| The one that they're using now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| Not in a couple of years, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| So can we expect that to be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| I guess is this really the time or place to talk about this individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| This is the point of order for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| I have several issues with my schools that we can drag out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| I think this is an overview of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| I'll just ask if there's going to be put in the next budget since Dr. McIntyre said they're going to present the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| and just see if they can put something on there for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| I can just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| It is not in the capital budget that the school board approved most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| Any other questions for Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| Yeah, I have a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| Dr. McIntyre, when are you scheduling these one-on-one meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| When will they start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| In the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| So certainly before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| I know the mayor is going to present his budget recommendations coming up here in mid-May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| The 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Yeah, the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| So sometime, I think, over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| But certainly before the commission, I think, Mr. Chairman, I don't know when you all are going to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| I thought probably the end of May at the earliest take up the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| So we were thinking in the next two weeks or so that we'd begin to have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| Okay, because I would just like to have time to sit down and be able to digest everything and not just get it and then next day have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| We'll get on it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| I got an email last week, Randy, about the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| You may not have got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| We're going to move to Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Thomas' discussion regarding protocols for honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| You know, here is my point for putting this on the agenda to discuss, is that we've only been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7497)|
| 2:05:07| the four of us have only been on the commission for a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| and I haven't seen any really protocol or procedure that is given on honorary proclamations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7510)|
| 2:05:21| except just to, I guess, have one written up and then we vote for it real quickly before we bring people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| And my point was, could we all understand as we do them, because I think they're very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| We honor individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| We honor groups that are well-deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| But I just want to make sure as we do this, especially anything we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| if everybody would just be aware and make sure we all get all the information about who we're honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7546)|
| 2:05:54| or what organization we're honoring so we can make good decisions on what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| whether or not we want to vote, don't want to vote for it, or we abstain from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| But I just want to make sure that we all get the correct information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| and if you're doing one, I would ask that we all make sure the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| have as much information as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Well, the protocol is in the commission rules, and so they're all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| And all of that, if we're going back to last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| all of that information was sent out with the agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| and then the changes were sent out the next day on Friday, so there was a weekend to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| But the protocol is in the commission rules, and it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| They just actually changed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| There was a limit on how many you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| and then the commission rules committee decided to eliminate that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| And so here we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| Can you pull your microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| In answer to Commissioner Thomas's query, up until the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| each commissioner was allowed one a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| but we did take that out because nobody was, and I hate to use this word, overusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7622)|
| 2:07:12| But it seems like lately we're giving them for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Now, I'm for honoring things that need to be honored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| but when you start passing them out like peanuts on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| they lose the value that I think we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| As far as the notification of changes, you said those come out on Friday before the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7647)|
| 2:07:37| What about the two that were added that Monday morning before the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| The only one that was added was Mr. Brown's that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| No, not according to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| There was two added on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| My point is this, that if there is a change between the workshop and the regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7672)|
| 2:08:02| then we should have 48 hours notice of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| and I think that needs to be made part of our modus of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| because it could keep us from having misunderstandings like we had this past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7693)|
| 2:08:24| It's unfortunate, but, you know, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| So I think we need to be judicious in the causes that we choose to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7708)|
| 2:08:39| and judicious in honoring the respecting the other commissioners on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7719)|
| 2:08:55| Just to do one, just to be doing it, doesn't mean anything to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| and I think it needs to have some meaning, put some meaning back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| It's just like with the Little League ball teams today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| My five-year-old, when his grandson was five years old, he played little ball, tee ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7749)|
| 2:09:17| Every kid on the team, on every team, got a trophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| Everyone on every team is not a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| We're teaching kids from five years up that you're going to get rewarded in life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7766)|
| 2:09:33| whether you do a good job, a bad job, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| Now, maybe the winning team got a little bit bigger trophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| but an attaboy is a lot different than a trophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| and I think we've got putting the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| and I think that we need to start looking at some things and pulling the reins back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150427?start=7793)|
